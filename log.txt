TRUMP: "I\'m not worried." ...and defended the measures taken by the White House to protect him and Vice President Mike Pence, after a second staffer tested positive for the coronavirus in the last two days. TRUMP: "We\'ve taken very strong precautions at the White House but, again, we\'re dealing with a... invisible situation." REUTERS REPORTER JEFF MASON: "Mr. President, is there a reason why people just aren\'t wearing masks at the White House?" TRUMP: "Well, they are." MASON: "But they\'re not, sir." TRUMP: "No, people that are serving me are." MASON: "Well, we have not seen anyone wear a mask around you, sir, in the last two weeks." Trump\'s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, jumped in to say the proper precautions were being taken. MEADOWS: "I can tell you that the testing protocol is a strong regime and as it gets closer to the president, some of those that serve him will wearing a mask in those closer proximities." The latest confirmed case of the virus inside the White House belonged to Katie Miller, the vice president\'s press secretary, and the wife of one of Trump\'s senior advisers, Stephen Miller. TRUMP: "Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive. She hasn\'t come into contact with me. She spent some time with the vice president... The tests are perfect but something could happen between a test where it\'s good and then something happens and all of a sudden... she was tested very recently and tested negative and then today, I guess, for some reason, she tested positive. So Mike knows about it and Mike has done what he has to do. I think he is on an airplane going to some far away place." That far away place was Des Moines, Iowa, where Pence met with faith leaders about holding "responsible" gatherings. The vice president did not wear a mask. The diagnosis of Pence\'s spokesperson comes a day after news that Trump\'s personal valet had tested positive for the virus, raising alarm about its potential spread within the White House\'s inner most circle.'}

{'_id': '0f99bd1a4439958bf4a00dd6c89ba05c', 'title': 'A Georgia Chicken Town Reels After a Plant Disaster', 'description': "GAINESVILLE, Ga. — The morning after a nitrogen leak in a chicken plant killed six people in the self-proclaimed poultry capital of the world, nearly everyone in its big Latino community choked down their grief and fear and did what they had come to Gainesville to do. They woke up before sunrise Friday and went to work. On Catalina Drive, a tidy street of vinyl-sided houses near the scene of Thursday’s accident, workers pulled out of driveways in dusty pickup trucks or zipped off to the plants in little sedans with antiviral masks around their chins. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Up on the Atlanta highway, other workers were shuttled to the chicken plants by the armada of local taxis — with names like Taxi Quetzal, Taxi Solano’s, Fiesta Cab — that has become a crucial workaround for the many immigrants living in the country illegally who do not want to risk being pulled over and possibly deported. Nina Baca, 18, answered her door just after dawn, the habitual stench from the plants spoiling the crisp and cloud-free January morning. Baca had worked the overnight shift Thursday a short distance from the accident site. It was all business as usual, she said, except for the beginning. “We just gathered around to pray for the people who lost their family,” Baca said. Of the six people killed Thursday by the ruptured liquid nitrogen line at Gainesville’s Foundation Food Group plant, five were Latino; 11 more people were injured. A 3-year-old child lost both parents in the accident, according to Arturo Corso, a local lawyer who has worked with families from the plant. The accident left a punctuating sort of pain in Gainesville, a city of 43,000 that is about 40% Latino, underscoring the illness and economic hardship that have been ravaging the workforce in Georgia’s best-known chicken town as a result of the coronavirus. In much the same way some of Gainesville’s workers living in the country illegally have feared getting coronavirus treatment or testing in recent months, some of the 130 workers evacuated from the plant Thursday ducked out of the official rendezvous point before undergoing medical checks because they feared that being noticed by authorities might lead to their deportation, according to Jennifer McCall, a local immigration lawyer. That is the way of things in Gainesville, a city about 55 miles northeast of Atlanta where a post-World War II boom in the chicken business has been powered in recent decades by waves of immigrants. “It’s terrifying,” said Maria del Rosario Palacios, a local organizer. “Our folks are completely scared about whether they can go to the hospital to get checked out. They say, ‘I will have to give my name when I’m working under another name.’” According to a company spokesperson, Thursday’s accident was the result of a ruptured line carrying liquid nitrogen, a substance often used to chill or freeze processed chicken that when released can make air unbreathable. It occurred a little after 10 a.m., sending dozens of frightened and confused workers into the parking lot. One witness told an Atlanta TV station that he saw workers run out of the plant gasping for air, with two of them collapsing in the grass. In a nearby trailer park, Juana Paloblanco, 54, heard the wail of sirens from rushing emergency vehicles Thursday morning. A Spanish-language text appeared on her smartphone: “Stay inside of your trailer or stay away from the area of Memorial Park,” it said, warning of contaminants in the air. “I was pretty scared,” she said. Georgia is the nation’s top chicken producer, churning out more than 30 million pounds of chicken and 7 million eggs every day, according to the state’s poultry federation. The grueling, low-paying jobs are often eschewed by Americans, and large numbers of Latin American immigrants began settling in Gainesville in the 1990s to take up the work. Since then, they and their children have changed the face of the city. Gainesville’s Latino population has doubled since 2000. And nearly 12% of the city’s residents are in the country illegally, according to the Pew Research Center, one of the largest proportions in any metropolitan area. They don rubber boots and smocks and earn their livings in the plants. They relax and shop on a stretch of Atlanta highway that can feel closer to Michoacán than Macon, with tiendas and restaurants offering hyper-regionalized tastes of home. Strains of welcome and rejection run concurrently among the city’s non-Latino population. For years, the city’s pretty downtown, with its old square organized around a monument to the Confederate dead, has hosted a jubilant Latino festival. Downtown also features a small park celebrating the city’s poultry industry, with a small statue of a chicken on a two-story-high pedestal. A plaque honors the region’s midcentury poultry industry leaders who did for the chicken industry “what Henry Ford had done for automobile manufacturing.” On Friday morning, a nearby digital billboard flashed an advertisement from the Wayne Farms chicken company, with a photo of a smiling female worker in a smock and a hairnet. “WE ARE THE FRONT LINE FOR FEEDING THE WORLD,” it said. The hosts of a local English-language radio talk show spoke of their prayers for the families of the dead and injured. At the same time, the lack of legal status has made Gainesville’s immigrant workforce vulnerable to deportation. Hall County, a Republican stronghold where Donald Trump won 70% of the vote last year, participates in a controversial immigration enforcement program that enlists and trains local law enforcement to identify people living in the country illegally who were booked into jails. Under the program, the county routinely transfers those people to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after booking them for infractions like driving without a license or committing a traffic infraction, according to community advocates. More than 100 people were deported under the program last year, a number that went up significantly after Trump took office. Critics say that immigrants are also vulnerable to exploitation at work. “The Gainesville poultry industry preys on immigrant labor, recruiting undocumented workers and refugees to work in some of the most dangerous conditions of any sector in the economy,” said John Fossum, a researcher at the University of Texas who has studied the industry. “It is an industrywide problem but particularly acute in Gainesville.” Thursday’s accident is being investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is no stranger to the plant. The Foundation Food Group facility was fined more than $140,000 for safety violations in 2015 and 2016, records show. The next year, two employees had multiple fingers amputated after they were caught in machinery. More fines were levied in 2019. The plant changed ownership in 2020. Then came the coronavirus. As elsewhere in the country, after being deemed essential by the federal government, poultry plants have striven to keep production at normal, pre-pandemic levels. In May 2020, when COVID-19 was rampaging through the poultry facilities, 56% of those who got sick were Latino workers, and Hall County had twice the infection rate of neighboring Gwinnett County. The Gainesville plants have not consistently provided adequate protective gear or ensured other safety measures are in place to protect the workers, according to community leaders. Palacios, the organizer, said she regularly supplied disposable masks to workers. “We have a high rate of COVID, and that plant is a plant where a lot of our folks have been getting sick,” she said. She said her mother caught COVID-19 at a chicken plant a few months ago from a man who had been coming to work visibly sick. The man later died. Palacios said her mother had a stroke while she was sick. Foundation Food Group said in a statement that it followed federal guidelines for sending home any employees who test positive for the virus, providing up to two weeks' paid sick leave, and that it had not been made aware of any coronavirus-related deaths at its facilities. “The Foundation Food Group policy highly recommends and encourages employees to wear masks,” which are provided by the company, the statement said. Responding to Thursday’s accident, Jerry Wilson, the company’s president and CEO, said it was reaching out to families of the affected workers. “Foundation Food Group is working diligently with governmental authorities in determining the cause of the accident,” he said. As of late Friday morning, Palacios said, she had spoken with 11 workers at the Foundation plant. A number of them were complaining of headaches. She was trying, she said, to persuade them to get over their fears and go to a hospital. Vanessa Sarazua, the founder and executive director of Hispanic Alliance GA, a support group, opened the group’s strip-mall storefront and directed a small group of volunteers to help both those who had somehow been affected by the accident — and might need help with burials, psychiatric care or rent — and others who were simply hungry. The latter have been growing in number, Sarazua said, because of the lack of work during the pandemic. Many other families have relied on food handouts because they were not guaranteed sick leave by their employers during quarantine and had to go without their salaries when they fell ill. A little after 10 a.m., a despondent family came in, including a woman whose sister was killed at the plant. Her face was grim and she held a phone to her ear as she trudged silently into Sarazua’s office. But throughout much of the city, work simply went on as usual. In front of La Flor de Jalisco #2, a popular supermarket, Alberto Ramirez, 54, stood with a large contingent of day workers. He said he was pained by the tragedy at the chicken plant. “People are going to be a lot more afraid to go to work in those places now,” he said. But he doubted if anyone would stay away. “We’ve got bills,” he said. “We’ve got the rent. We’ve got families to support.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company"}

It Knows a Bit About Surviving Crises.', 'description': 'KYOTO, Japan -- Naomi Hasegawa\'s family sells toasted mochi out of a small, cedar-timbered shop next to a rambling old shrine in Kyoto. The family started the business to provide refreshments to weary travelers coming from across Japan to pray for pandemic relief -- in the year 1000.Now, more than a millennium later, a new disease has devastated the economy in the ancient capital, as its once reliable stream of tourists has evaporated. But Hasegawa is not concerned about her enterprise\'s finances.Like many businesses in Japan, her family\'s shop, Ichiwa, takes the long view -- albeit longer than most. By putting tradition and stability over profit and growth, Ichiwa has weathered wars, plagues, natural disasters, and the rise and fall of empires. Through it all, its rice flour cakes have remained the same.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesSuch enterprises may be less dynamic than those in other countries. But their resilience offers lessons for businesses in places like the United States, where the coronavirus has forced tens of thousands into bankruptcy."If you look at the economics textbooks, enterprises are supposed to be maximizing profits, scaling up their size, market share and growth rate. But these companies\' operating principles are completely different," said Kenji Matsuoka, a professor emeritus of business at Ryukoku University in Kyoto."Their No. 1 priority is carrying on," he added. "Each generation is like a runner in a relay race. What\'s important is passing the baton."Japan is an old-business superpower. The country is home to more than 33,000 with at least 100 years of history -- over 40% of the world\'s total. Over 3,100 have been running for at least two centuries. Around 140 have existed for more than 500 years. And at least 19 claim to have been continuously operating since the first millennium.The businesses, known as "shinise," are a source of both pride and fascination. Regional governments promote their products. Business management books explain the secrets of their success. And entire travel guides are devoted to them.Most of these old businesses are, like Ichiwa, small, family-run enterprises that deal in traditional goods and services. But some are among Japan\'s most famous companies, including Nintendo, which got its start making playing cards 131 years ago, and the soy sauce brand Kikkoman, which has been around since 1917.To survive for a millennium, Hasegawa said, a business cannot just chase profits. It has to have a higher purpose. In the case of Ichiwa, that was a religious calling: serving the shrine\'s pilgrims.Those kinds of core values, known as "kakun," or family precepts, have guided many companies\' business decisions through the generations. They look after their employees, support the community and strive to make a product that inspires pride.For Ichiwa, that means doing one thing and doing it well -- a very Japanese approach to business.The company has declined many opportunities to expand, including, most recently, a request from Uber Eats to start online delivery. Mochi remains the only item on the menu, and if you want something to drink, you are politely offered the choice of roasted green tea.For most of Ichiwa\'s history, the women of the Hasegawa family made the sweet snack in more or less the same way. They boiled the rice in the water from a small spring that burbles into the shop\'s cellar, pounded it into a paste and then shaped it into balls that they gently toasted on wooden skewers over a small cast-iron hibachi.The rice\'s caramelized skin is brushed with sweet miso paste and served to the shrine\'s visitors hot, before the delicate treat cools and turns tough and chewy.Ichiwa has made a few concessions to modernity. The local health department has forbidden the use of well water. A mochi machine hidden in the kitchen mechanically pounds the rice, saving a few hours of work each morning. And, after centuries of operating on the honor system, it charges a fixed price per plate, a change it instituted sometime after World War II as the business began to pay more attention to its finances.The Japanese companies that have endured the longest have often been defined by an aversion to risk -- shaped in part by past crises -- and an accumulation of large cash reserves.It is a common trait among Japanese enterprises and part of the reason that the country has so far avoided the high bankruptcy rates of the United States during the pandemic. Even when they "make some profits," said Tomohiro Ota, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, "they do not increase their capital expenditure."Large enterprises in particular keep substantial reserves to ensure that they can continue issuing paychecks and meet their other financial obligations in the event of an economic downturn or a crisis. But even smaller businesses tend to have low debt levels and an average of one to two months of operating expenses on hand, Ota said.When they do need support, financing is cheap and readily available. Interest rates in Japan have been low for decades, and a government stimulus package introduced in response to the pandemic has effectively zeroed them out for most small enterprises.Small shinise often own their own facilities and rely on members of the family to help keep payroll costs down, allowing them to stockpile cash. When Toshio Goto, a professor at the Japan University of Economics Graduate School who has written several books on the enterprises, conducted a survey this summer of companies that are at least 100 years old, more than a quarter said they had enough funds on hand to operate for two years or longer.Still, that does not mean they are frozen in time. Many started during the 200-year period, beginning in the 17th century, when Japan largely sealed itself off from the outside world, providing a stable business environment. But over the last century, survival has increasingly meant finding a balance between preserving traditions and adapting to quickly changing market conditions.For some companies, that has meant updating their core business. NBK, a materials firm that started off making iron kettles in 1560, is now producing high-tech machine parts. Hosoo, a 332-year-old kimono manufacturer in Kyoto, has expanded its textile business into home furnishings and even electronics.For others, keeping up with the times can be hard, especially those, like Tanaka Iga Butsugu, that are essentially selling tradition itself.Tanaka Iga has been making Buddhist religious goods in Kyoto since 885. It is famous for what its 72nd-generation president, Masaichi Tanaka, jokingly refers to as the "Mercedes-Benz" of butsudan -- household shrines that can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.The pandemic has been "tough," he said, but the biggest challenges faced by his company, and many others, are Japan\'s aging society and changing tastes.Some companies have closed because the owners could not find a successor. For Tanaka, it is getting harder and harder to replace skilled traditional workers. Business is crimped because fewer people nowadays go to the temples he supplies. And new homes are rarely built with a place to put a butsudan, which normally occupies its own special nook in a traditional Japanese-style room with tatami flooring and sliding paper doors.When it comes to religious tradition, there is little room for innovation, Tanaka said. Many of his products\' designs are nearly as old as the company. He has considered incorporating 3D printers into his business, but he wonders who\'s going to buy items made with one.Ichiwa is blissfully untroubled by such concerns. The family is large, the business is small, and the only special skill needed to grill the mochi is a high tolerance for blistering heat.But Hasegawa, 60, admits she sometimes feels the pressure of the shop\'s history. Even though the business doesn\'t provide much of a living, everyone in the family from a young age "was warned that as long as one of us was still alive, we needed to carry on," she said.One reason "we keep going," she added, is "because we all hate the idea of being the one to let it go."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company'}

{'_id': '1e0e57cb505a7c0be1525a8dcf0d39cb', 'title': 'In His Final Month in Office, Trump Works Overtime to Drag the GOP Down With Him', 'description': 'President Donald Trump has spent his final weeks in office much as he has the preceding years: setting fire to the relationships that buttressed his rise to power.Over the past few days, the president has floated primaries against top-ranking Republicans, pushed out administration officials who were bedrock allies, threatened major bills crafted in conjunction with his team, and turned on officials who won’t help him cling to power. Inside the White House, the response to it all has been growing alarm, coupled with resignation that this is the 45th U.S. president’s modus operandi. Trump’s profound self-interest is no secret. But never has that trait been so visible against a backdrop this consequential, with his legal team and administration’s attack on democratic processes so blatantly anti-democratic.“The president spent much of the Christmas weekend [at Mar-a-Lago] talking about other Republicans who weren’t doing what he wanted and acting like failures and defeatists,” said one person present at his private Florida club who was on the receiving end of his grievances. Even behind closed doors, the source said, “he was not finding much to be happy about this Christmas.”But Trump’s actions raise questions about his future as well. And they have illuminated—once more—the fundamental paradox behind his political rise: How can someone burn so many bridges and not eventually find himself alone?“He is no longer the celebrity mogul magnate as he was in New York, and now he is part of… that exclusive Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush [one term president] club,” said Sam Nunberg, a Trump supporter and former political adviser. “He has gone from handling this in a manner that would have helped him keep this power base that he had to now going through conspiracy theories and giving over the portfolio to two bumbling morons in Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell… You don’t want to go out like this with him. It’s not like you’re in a bunker at the end of WWII. You’re in Crazy Town.”Trump has always fashioned himself as a bit of an iconoclast. His brashness stood out even in 1980s New York City. His love of attention made him gauche among his contemporaries. He first considered running for president as an independent. And even when he secured the Republican Party’s nomination, it was under the framework of a hostile takeover.One surprise of his time in office is that he stuck so firmly to a traditional Republican agenda. But Trump was never truly part of the party, at least not in any way recognizable to somebody like his second-in-command Mike Pence. Nor was he a traditional politician. He showed no loyalty to his aides or fellow GOP lawmakers or his cabinet members. He fired people over Twitter, mocked his GOP detractors, ran off his apostates, and chastised leadership when they weren’t acquiescent.And yet, even by those standards, the past few days have struck insiders as shocking for their destructiveness. Trump has attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for conceding Joe Biden is president-elect; he’s threatened to primary Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) for not going along with efforts to block the election’s certification; he drove off Attorney General Bill Barr for not doing enough to tilt the election with department resources; he’s turned on his White House counsel Pat Cipollone for not supporting authoritarian initiatives like impounding voting machines; and he cut a deal to give Morocco annexation of the Western Sahara in part out of retribution against Sen. James Inhofe (an opponent of annexation), who wouldn’t use a major defense bill to go after social media giants like Trump wanted. He’s attacked the Republican leadership in Georgia right as the state gets ready for a runoff election that could determine control of the U.S. Senate.Most recently, he took a torch to a COVID-relief bill negotiated by his own treasury secretary and threatened not to sign a government funding bill for provisions that largely matched the requests his own budget office made. And to those who’ve complained that his behavior has been erratic and deeply problematic, he’s extended two giant middle fingers.The Real Political Heroes of This Dumpster Fire Year“I don’t care,” Trump privately said in the past few days of conservative criticism of his opposition to the funding bills, according to two people familiar with the matter. Instead Trump has accused his GOP stalwarts of not doing enough for him, the sources said. One person who spoke to Trump recounted gently reminding the president that his move on the relief legislation might make life harder for his Republican allies in D.C. and in Georgia, only to have Trump respond by saying (as this source paraphrased), “Well, that’s life.” The president then quickly pivoted to grousing about how these elected Republicans should be focusing more on 2020 election “fraud” and overturning Joe Biden’s clear victory, and complaining that they weren’t fighting aggressively enough or holding a united front on this, the source relayed.That Trump would disregard his party and turn on top aides in a time of duress surely couldn’t have been a surprise to those on the short end of the exchange. Few, if any, relationships with Trump end in a place better than where they started.Take Nunberg. When he joined Trump’s campaign, it was despite the fact that Trump had—in his words—“screwed my father’s firm out of money.” But bygones can be bygones and Nunberg said he saw something historic in what Trump was doing. So he got on board. And, for a while, it worked. Until it didn’t. He was fired after racist Facebook posts were unearthed on his page. He claimed they weren’t his at the time, but later apologized for the posts in an interview with MSNBC.The Trump campaign was quick to distance themselves from Nunberg, and Trump sued his former campaign aide for $10 million in 2016, claiming he’d violated a confidentiality agreement by speaking to the press. The two settled the lawsuit later that same year.Looking back now, Nunberg believes Trump “ruined my career.” And he won’t be the only one either, he predicts. “Hope Hicks,” he said, “should have stayed at Fox [Corps].” Corey Lewandowski, he predicted of the one-time 2016 Trump campaign manager and his nemesis, “will be back to being a low piece of rent in New Hampshire in no piece of time.”Others have even less certain futures. Top administration officials such as John McEntee and Dan Scavino have operated in the Trump White House with vast amounts of influence, with the former serving as the president’s purge-leader, the latter one of Trump’s most trusted advisers and a conductor of much of the in-house social media and MAGA messaging. Both are avatars of the Republican operator who at this point is so tied to the outgoing president that it is hard to imagine their public lives without him as a vehicle. Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, suffered notable public infamy after being pushed aside from his post and when police were summoned to his home. Other aides have been forced to endure legal drama—and the massive bills they’ve entailed—political isolation, and uncertain returns to the private sector. Some have been pardoned in recent days. But those pardons carry a strain of infamy with them.Nunberg, for his part, couldn’t explain why it was that people are drawn to Trump knowing the damage he will cause them. Some, he suspected, want the proximity of power. Others believe they can shape him. Many see money to be made from it. But much of it was a mystery.“I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know,” said Nunberg. “I was the one who was mistreated worse out of anyone.”‘Rich White Men’: Trump Pardons Manafort & Other AlliesRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': '47a8cf1a4ec9587dff763518bf9b3252', 'title': 'New U.S. Citizenship Test Is Longer and More Difficult', 'description': 'The Trump administration is rolling out sweeping changes to the test immigrants must take to become U.S. citizens, injecting hints of conservative philosophy and making the test harder for many learners of the English language.The new citizenship test that went into effect Tuesday is longer than before, with applicants now required to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly instead of six out of 10. It is also more complex, eliminating simple geography and adding dozens of possible questions, some nuanced and involving complex phrasing, that could trip up applicants who do not consider them carefully.Of the 18 questions removed from the previous test, 11 were questions that had simple, sometimes one-word answers.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe new test adds one more hurdle for immigrants who hope to become voting citizens, coming in the waning days of an administration that has imposed substantial new barriers to immigration and limits on the ability of those already in the country to aspire to legal residence and, eventually, naturalization.One test question that has drawn particular scrutiny provides a new answer to the question, "Who does a U.S. Senator represent?" Previously, the answer was "all people of the state"; on the new test, it is "citizens" in the state.Singled out for a new question is the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states all powers not specifically granted to the federal government, a part of the Bill of Rights that is a favorite among conservatives questioning federal authority.Another new question, "Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War?" has one answer that is considered correct: "to stop the spread of Communism." The test does not take on the issue of the vehement protests or the huge death toll stemming from the war.Immigration organizations, including some that have helped thousands of people complete their naturalization applications over the past decade, warn that the new test could make it harder for poor immigrants from non-English-speaking countries to become citizens and ultimately suppress the number of immigrants who vote.Critics also said the new test could create even more backlogs in a system already plagued with delays."It\'s a last-ditch effort on their way out the door for the administration to keep people from realizing their dreams of becoming citizens," said Eric Cohen, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco, a nonprofit group that helps permanent residents apply for citizenship."There is no legal reason, no regulatory reason to do this," said Cohen, noting that the citizenship test had remained unchanged since 2008. "They decided on their own that they have to change it for political reasons."Dan Hetlage, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the naturalization process, said in a statement that the test was revised "to ensure that it remains an instrument that comprehensively assesses applicants\' knowledge of American history, government and values and supports assimilation."President-elect Joe Biden has the option of reversing the changes, though that likely could not occur, if at all, until several months into the new year.The new test will be required of all applicants who apply for citizenship after Dec. 1, though there is often a lag of several months between when candidates apply and when they are scheduled for an interview with a USCIS officer, meaning that some candidates may still be taking the old test.The current pass rate for the citizenship test, according to USCIS, is 91%. An analysis of the new test by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network suggested that 40 questions out of the original 100 remained unchanged from the previous version; the rest were reworded or newly introduced.Already, some immigrants were expressing nervousness about changes to the test.Nefi Reyes, an electrician from El Salvador who took the earlier test this year, passed with a perfect score. It had been 30 years since he had crossed the border into the United States to escape the civil war in El Salvador, and he voted in the United States for the first time in November."I feel lucky that I got it done," Reyes said of the changes to the test. He had had difficulty memorizing the names of the colonies, he said, and the new test requires applicants to name not three of the original 13 states, as he had managed to do, but five.Luz Gallegos, executive director of Todec, a nonprofit group that assists immigrants in Southern California, said her organization had seen a rush in immigrants applying to take the citizenship test, not only so they could vote in the November election but also because many hoped to avoid the new test. "As it is, it\'s difficult for them to memorize all the answers to the civics test," she said.Immigrants are not alone in finding the citizenship test, even in its previous form, challenging. About 1 in 3 Americans could pass a multiple-choice test consisting of items taken from that version, according to a 2018 national survey by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. Most of the respondents did not know how many justices serve on the Supreme Court or which countries the United States fought in World War II.Citizenship tests have gone through various incarnations since being introduced around a century ago, replacing an earlier system, broadly criticized at the time, in which naturalization judges evaluated immigrants\' knowledge of civics and the English language as they saw fit."There was absolutely inconsistency and unfairness in the way that prospective citizens were examined by naturalization judges," said Jack Schneider, an assistant professor of education at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, noting that such hearings resulted in the rejection of large numbers of applicants.The test has changed considerably over time. Decades ago, the test asked how tall the Bunker Hill Monument is, missing, critics said, the more important issue of what it stands for. Another question, "How many stars are there on a quarter?" was deleted after it was noted that the right answer depended on the quarter.The new citizenship test is one of a number of moves made under the Trump administration to not only halt illegal immigration but restrict legal immigration as well. The administration has made it harder for people to obtain asylum, increased the costs of applying for citizenship and, under the cloak of the coronavirus pandemic, suspended the issuance of green cards to immigrants seeking temporary work in the country.Taken together, these moves amount to a break from what historically had been bipartisan support for naturalization for immigrants who lived and worked in the United States and embraced the opportunity to become citizens.Applicants must already fill out a 20-page application, pass background checks, submit a bevy of documents, and pass civics and English tests during an interview. The government moved this year to raise fees for naturalization from $725 to $1,170, or $1,160 if the application was filed online, but a federal judge in California blocked the increase in September.Organizations that offer citizenship classes to help immigrants study for the test are scrambling to revamp their lesson plans to respond to the new questions.Lynne Weintraub, who trains citizenship instructors and was involved in the design of the 2008 test, said the revisions were adopted without outside professional input that might have helped ensure that the test was a fair and valid measure of applicants\' knowledge of civics."You can\'t even imagine the turmoil that this has created," Weintraub said. The new test, she said, presents additional problems for many English language learners by clustering abstract concepts into one phrase in some questions, "making them impossible for immigrants with low English proficiency and less education to follow."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company'}

But 2020 was the year the rumors span out of control. Encouraged by the omnipotence of the online rumor mill, the Russian media is now daring to commit them to publication.Tabloids this year dabbled in stories that the Russian president was sick and poised to quit the Kremlin. After Putin, who is 68, coughed at a meeting with the government on Nov. 19, the gossip went into overdrive.Vladimir Putin Is in Deep TroubleSome claimed the president was suffering from cancer, others diagnosed him with Parkinson’s disease. A video of Putin absentmindedly playing with a folder in October fueled the rumors that he was suffering from some kind of degenerative condition.As pro-Putin ideologists often emphasize “Russia is Putin,” so media reports analyzed Putin’s health as a vital matter of Russia’s future.All of it without a shred of evidence. The closest thing you get to an official Kremlin health report is the occasional shirtless photoshoot.Professor Valery Solovey, who has become one of Moscow’s most notorious sensationalists, this year fanned the speculation on YouTube by claiming that Putin was planning to quit any time now as a result of some “force majeure.”The speculation over Putin’s long-term health would seem to be at odds with his decision to push through legislation that allows him to stay in power until 2036. The work for that formally began last January, and he decided to rubber-stamp it with a nationwide referendum over the summer that was not legally necessary but offered Putin the chance to show that he was still the boss when—as expected—he won the referendum comfortably.Putin’s Now Positioned to Be President for LifeThe power move failed to quell the speculation among Moscow’s elite, where names of potential successors buzz around incessantly.On radio Echo of Moscow, known as Moscow’s ear, the editor-in-chief Aleksey Venediktov reports that the top two contenders are ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the Security Council, and Sergei Naryshkin, the director of Foreign Intelligence.Others claim there will be another Putin after Putin. The president’s nephew Roman Putin seems to have big political ambitions—the businessman with the familiar name founded a new political party this month called “Russia Without Corruption.”Speculation over Putin’s intentions was further inflamed in November when the duma—Russia’s Kremlin-friendly parliament—passed the first reading of a bill that would grant Russian presidents and their families immunity from prosecution after they leave office.Vladimir Solovyov, a well-connected Kommersant newspaper commentator, says Putin has left Russia with a terribly confused picture. “This year, he changed the constitution to secure more terms but now he lets more fog in and says he does not know, if he is going to run again in 2024,” he said.Solovyov told The Daily Beast that he—and many others—had assumed Putin would try to hand power to a close ally and remain a powerful figure behind the scenes like Nursultan Nazarbayev has done in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev stood down after almost 20 years as president but retains his position as head of the security council and “power behind the throne.”Watching Putin put his support behind Alexander Lukashenko, whose post-Soviet population in Belarus is attempting to force him out of office, has changed Solovyov’s analysis.“If before we thought he would choose a peaceful way to transfer power, like in Kazakhstan, now it looks like he will go for the Belarusian bloody and violent scenario,” he said.Putin has already clamped down on protests this year, deciding that even one-person demonstrations were unacceptable.The thrust of Putin’s strategy has remained unchanged for decades: the Russian president has brought former KGB officers like himself into all key management areas in public life in order to provide security for what he calls the vertical of power.Ever more public debate in Russia is being defined as spy intrigue. Reports, myths, legends about Putin’s whereabouts, his associates’ business life, his personal life is described by the government as a spy verses spy story, and not as a matter of public information, which they should share.Where, for example, is Putin riding out the pandemic, which has already dented his popularity?No one knows. One media report this year claimed that Putin built an exact replica of his Kremlin office in Sochi so as to keep his location hidden even to people he speaks on camera. Officials hinted that claim was misinformation peddled by foreign spy agencies.Putin is also believed to have a secret hideout in the remote Altai mountains close to the border with Mongolia.Any taxi driver in the Republic of Altai, in Siberia, reckons they know the approximate location of Putin’s residence. They say it is somewhere around the 600-kilometer mark on the Chuisky highway, and he is there often. The constant helicopters in the sky create a local belief that Putin spent much of his spring and summer quarantine in the mountains of Altai, though of course nobody knows for sure.Putin’s private life has also been hidden for decades, which has led to much speculation over the years, but again that has accelerated in recent months.In November, several media reports suggested that Putin had a secret daughter in St. Petersburg with Svetlana Krivonogikh. The story raised curiosity about the life of the teenager involved but also raised questions of corruption.How had Putin’s alleged lover—a former cleaner—acquired a significant shareholding in Bank Rossiya, a bank run by some of Putin’s longtime associates?The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Bank Rossiya’s owners and partners in 2014, on the day Russian parliament passed a law admitting Crimea to the Russian Federation.Corruption has been a feature of elite Russian circles since the Soviet era. “Nobody is surprised any more that top men in power are corrupt,” Boris Vishnevsky, deputy of Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg told The Daily Beast. “But more and more millions of people watch Alexey Navalny’s independent investigations just to learn the details.”Navalny’s online exposés and his political campaigning on the ground have made him effectively Russia’s leader of the opposition.And here the spy games come into play once again.Navalny was poisoned with a dose of Novichok while he was out east, in Siberia, where anti-Putin demonstrations have been growing. Navalny survived, but by early September, 77 percent of the Russian population knew about the attempted assassination.Putin’s Got Big Problems in Russia’s ProvincesBellingcat published a painstakingly detailed account of the attack, which included specific names of Russian secret service operatives who were trailing the opposition leader at the time he was poisoned. It looked like damning evidence the security services were to blame.When Putin was confronted by this report at his annual press conference, he did not deny the main points in the report that Navalny had been trailed and the cellphone records mentioned in the report actually belonged to the Federal Security Service, FSB officers. But the spy games deepened from there.“That patient of a Berlin clinic has the support of U.S. intelligence services,” Putin said, not naming Navalny, who is receiving treatment in Germany. “Therefore, the Russian special services should track him.”Kremlin’s World War III Propaganda Meltdown Shows Putin Is Cornered The Russian president claimed that Bellingcat, CNN, the Insider and Der Spiegel magazine had helped American intelligence agents to “legalize” disinformation from foreign spies.Putin believes he and his secret services have outsmarted Navalny.The president dismisses all efforts at openness, including about his own family life, as “tricks” in the information war.A former member of parliament, Dmitry Gudkov, is convinced that public frustration with Putin will only increase, especially since the even the FSB agents are not keeping their end up. “It takes nothing to find the truth about Putin’s agents—the data of cellphone calls can be purchased without any problems,” Gudkov told The Daily Beast.Putin is relying on the spy games of his FSB agents to secure his future, but in a world of online reporting and whirlwind rumors that undermine all of their authority, his hopes of maintaining the pretense dwindle by the day.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in the deaths of almost as many Americans who were killed during World War II, when over 405,000 servicemen lost their lives. While those killed in World War II were primarily young men and women, the novel coronavirus has been particularly lethal for older Americans, with those over age 75 particularly susceptible to the disease. Currently, coronavirus surges can be seen in the Southwest in California and Arizona, as well as in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. California has reported a local mutation of the coronavirus that appears to be driving infections there. “I’m decently confident that this is a more infectious strain of the virus,” Dr. Eric Vail, director of molecular pathology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, told the New York Times. President-elect Joe Biden will assume office on Wednesday facing the still-raging pandemic. Biden has called to vaccinate at least 100 million Americans during his first 100 days in office, as administration of coronavirus vaccines has moved more slowly than anticipated. “That is what the president elect has promised. It will be a hefty lift, but we have enough to do that,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Biden’s nominee for head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. While the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed has distributed 31.1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines across the U.S., just 12.3 million people have received their first dose. Dr. Walensky also warned that the U.S. could reach 500,000 deaths from coronavirus by mid-February.'}

{'_id': '58620cc223a4dd998444475be00a0eb7', 'title': "Fact-Checking Biden's Speech: Exaggerations", 'description': 'President Joe Biden, in a prime-time address Thursday night, exaggerated elements of the coronavirus pandemic along with his, and his predecessor’s, response to it. Here’s a fact-check. WHAT BIDEN SAID: “A year ago we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked, denials for days, weeks, then months.” This is exaggerated. It is true that President Donald Trump downplayed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic for months. But he was not exactly silent and did not fail to respond completely. One year ago, on March 12, 2020, Trump delivered an address from the Oval Office acknowledging the threat and announced new travel restrictions on much of Europe. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times WHAT BIDEN SAID: “As of now, total deaths in America, 527,726. That’s more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11 combined.” This is exaggerated. According to estimates from the Department of Veterans Affairs, a total of 392,393 died in combat in those three wars. Combined with the 2,977 people who died in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, that figure would be indeed smaller than the coronavirus death toll Biden cited. It would also be lower than the 529,000 death figure tracked by The New York Times. But factoring in deaths that occurred in service but outside of combat, the toll from the three wars (more than 610,000) would be higher than the current total number of virus-related deaths Biden cited. WHAT BIDEN SAID: “Two months ago this country didn’t have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or anywhere near all of the American public. But soon we will.” This is misleading. By the end of last year, the Trump administration had ordered at least 800 million vaccine doses that were expected for delivery by July 31, 2021, the Government Accountability Office reported. That included vaccines undergoing clinical trials as well as those not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. According to Kaiser Health News, that would have been enough to vaccinate 200 million people with authorized vaccines, and more than enough for 400 million once all the vaccines were cleared for use. The current U.S. population is roughly 330 million. And, contrary to Biden’s suggestions, both administrations deserve credit for the current state of the vaccine supply. WHAT BIDEN SAID: “When I took office 50 days ago, only 8% of Americans after months, only 8% of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is 65%.” This is misleading. When Biden took office on Jan. 20, the vaccination effort had just begun, after the FDA authorized Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in mid-December. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people between ages 65 and 74 receive the vaccine only after it has been administered to health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities, frontline essential workers and people over 75. It’s also worth noting that about 62.4% of people over 65 have received one vaccine dose, but just 32.2% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.

And President Biden will mark the solemn milestone with a moment of silence and a candle-lighting ceremony at the White House at sundown, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Biden will also deliver some remarks, the White House said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s top infectious disease expert and Biden\'s chief medical adviser, said Sunday that crossing half a million deaths is "terrible" and "really horrible." "It\'s nothing like we\'ve ever been through in the last 102 years since the 1918 influenza pandemic," he told CNN\'s Dana Bash. "People decades from now are going to be talking about this as a terribly historic milestone in the history of this country." Fauci confirmed that the U.S. will have 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines by July, enough "to be able to vaccinate virtually anybody and everybody," he told Fox News Sunday. The number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are falling steadily but still high, he added, and it\'s important to maintain public health measures. "As the nation reaches the milestone of a half-million deaths about a year after the first American succumbed to the coronavirus," The Washington Post contextualizes, "the necropolis of COVID has grown into a city of sorrow the size of Atlanta or Sacramento — a death toll larger than the combined American losses in combat from the Civil War, World War I, and World War II, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs." "You see on the news, \'X amount of people died,\' but it\'s so much more than that," said Priscilla Morse, whose 6-year-old daughter, Gigi, died of COVID-19 in August. "Do people see just how destroyed your family and your life is, six months later? Half-a-million families who\'ve had their world torn apart?" Gigis one of at least 271 children who have died from the coronavirus, the Post reports, and "each death represents a shattered family and a trauma deepened, parents say, by the rampant belief that kids can\'t get covid, or that it doesn\'t much harm them when they do."

{'_id': '61276551d4a791ced50ee57c57e3bcb7', 'title': 'Give Biden a Chance? On COVID Aid, Some Trump Voters Just Might', 'description': 'In Washington, Republicans stand united in opposition to President Joe Biden’s first major legislative proposal, a $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan that they have labeled a bloated, budget-busting “blue state bailout.” But in rural Maine, Anthony McGill, a self-identified conservative Republican, describes the bill as something else entirely: “Most of it sounds like a good idea,” he said. While McGill does not agree with all the provisions, he supports the central thrust of the bill: another round of direct stimulus payments to nearly all Americans. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “There’s a lot of people that could use those checks. I don’t know about needing them, but we could all use them,” said McGill, 52, who voted for former President Donald Trump in November. “The debt is so far out of hand that it’s a fantasy number at this point. We might as well just blow it out till everything collapses.” As Democrats prepare to vote as soon as Friday to pass the relief package in the House, Republican elected officials are struggling to overcome intraparty divides over whether to embrace the major pieces of the proposal — as well as to reconcile with the fact that many Republican voters support the plan. While Democrats are working swiftly to move their bill, Republicans are consumed by sideshows like false claims of voter fraud and what they call cancel culture, which are two major themes of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC, starting Friday in Orlando, Florida. The lack of a unified Republican economic message reflects an unsettled party that is unable to agree on how to chart a path through a Democratic-controlled Washington. While congressional Republicans take a scattershot approach to try to undermine the legislation, mayors and governors in their party push for the plan, saying their states and cities need the federal aid to keep police officers on their beats, to reopen schools and to help small businesses. Polling shows a significant number of Republican voters agree: More than 4 in 10 Republicans back Biden’s aid package, according to polling from the online research firm SurveyMonkey for The New York Times. Overall, 72% of Americans said they supported the bill, a number that includes 97% of Democrats. Interviews with more than two dozen Trump voters across the country found little consensus on fundamental questions that are central to the party’s future: Who won the election? Who should lead the GOP? And how much should Republicans try to work with the new administration? “There are things about President Biden that do concern me, but I’ve been told he’s kind of a moderate as far as Democrats go,” said Kelly Alexander, 62, a self-described right-wing conservative who owns a seasonal takeout restaurant in Mackinaw City, Michigan. “He’s our president. We need to give him a chance and not pick him apart for no good reason.” That is not the advice Robert Holland, a retiree from Rockland, Maine, would give to Republican leaders in Washington. “Biden and the Democrats are a bunch of stupid fools,” he said. “And the Republicans better get some spine and stop rolling over for them.” That disconnect over basic political strategy mirrors larger divisions within a party led for four years by a president who shredded mainstream conservative ideology on issues including the national debt, foreign policy and trade. While Trump moved a portion of the party’s base away from some of the right-wing economic orthodoxies that had characterized Republicanism for decades, he offered little in the form of a unified doctrine as a replacement. Republicans chose not to adopt a new platform at their national convention last year, instead simply carrying over the one from 2016, and Trump failed to articulate a second-term policy agenda as he campaigned for reelection. During his final weeks in office, he demanded that Congress more than triple the stimulus payments included in a December relief plan, a surprise maneuver that undermined Senate Republicans who had spent months opposing such spending. The current legislation would include another round of stimulus payments at $1,400 per person, an amount some Senate Republicans say is too high. Trump’s embrace of federal spending has complicated that messaging, downplaying traditional fiscal conservative concerns about the size of the debt and the deficit. This month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, argued that it was disingenuous for Republicans to raise such concerns considering their recent record. The national debt increased by about $7.8 trillion during Trump’s term, rising to the highest level since World War II. The surge was partly because of the economic stimulus passed during the pandemic but also because of the $1.5 trillion unpaid-for tax cut bill in 2017 and Trump’s unfettered spending. “When we had a Republican president and House and Senate, we kept on spending massively and adding almost a trillion dollars a year to the national debt,” Romney told the “Utah Politics” podcast. “Now we say, ‘This is outrageous, adding so much to the debt’?” Romney, who helped write the December stimulus bill, has argued that Biden’s legislation is a “clunker” that would waste money. Some Republicans share those concerns. Sean Wiley, who voted twice for Trump and describes himself as a conservative libertarian, said the government needed to provide assistance to people who have lost their jobs in the pandemic but argued that the current package was too large. Now that more people are being vaccinated and the country is getting back to work, he said, there is not as much need for a big government stimulus. Wiley, 52, who lives in Secane, Pennsylvania, and builds transmissions for racing cars, said he worried that the Biden bill would unnecessarily add to the national debt. “We’ve kind of mortgaged the future on this,” he said. Yet polling indicates that a notable portion of the Republican base is far more open to the bill. Last month, more than two-thirds of Republicans said they supported increasing individual payments to $2,000 from $600, which Trump had proposed but Senate Republicans had rejected. Nearly 7 in 10 Republicans said it was important for the current bill to include $1,400 direct checks, according to the SurveyMonkey poll. Many Republican voters who expressed concerns about the size of the stimulus package said they did not oppose the direct payments but worried about what they saw as extraneous provisions — like a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and $350 billion in aid for state and local governments. “People need help right now, and I’m OK with my tax dollars doing that; I’d help feed my neighbors if they needed it,” said Melissa Karn, 53, a Trump voter from the Phoenix suburbs. “But I am not on board with sending money to rebuild and bail out cities that have not been run very well for years.” Karn and other Trump supporters find little to like among their leaders in Congress who are making the same arguments, preferring the bombastic, burn-it-down style of the former president. They praised Republicans closely aligned with Trump, like Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and offered scorn for those he has clashed with, like Sen. Mitch McConnell, the minority leader. “It’s like the Republican establishment doesn’t have any common sense,” said Tara Davis, 40, a foster mother in Burlington, North Carolina. “We’re finding out all this money that’s just been wasted, and they couldn’t give people $2,000? It’s sickening. Anyone that the establishment hates, that’s who I like.” Judy Betty, a Republican and retired principal from Marana, Arizona, said she mostly opposed another round of stimulus payments but felt let down by congressional Republicans who she thinks did not fully investigate fraud claims surrounding the election — charges that were repeatedly shown to be baseless. “I don’t know about the Republican Party; it’s really gotten weird,” she said. “Everything is a lie. I think that is what Trump revealed for a lot of us who were open to him. This whole government is crap.” Sharon Tomski, 59, a teacher at a Catholic high school in the Milwaukee suburbs, said she believed that any stimulus plan should be targeted for those who lost income as a result of the pandemic. A self-described conservative, Tomski expressed little desire for the Republican Party to return to an era of fiscal austerity, even as she raised concerns about the possibility that Trump would again run for the White House. “I’d prefer he just goes away and lets someone else with his philosophy run,” Tomski said as she shopped at Bed Bath & Beyond in Waukesha, Wisconsin. “I think he’s too polarizing of a figure and needs to hand the baton to someone else.” Tomski is unlikely to get her wish anytime soon. Trump is headlining the conservative conference Sunday afternoon, an effort to keep control of the party firmly in his grasp. While his presence may buoy a large swath of Republicans, it is likely to turn off independents and any moderates who supported the former president. Patricia Dorenbosch, a Republican retiree from Henderson, Nevada, said she was turned off by Trump’s actions after the election, blaming him for stoking the attack on the Capitol and pushing baseless claims about voter fraud. She appreciates the new leadership emerging from Washington, even if it comes from a man she voted against. “I’m pleased so far; I really am surprised, but I am.

People learned about national vulnerabilities most had never considered, and about depths of resilience they never imagined needing except in wartime. Even the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, for all their horror and the two decades of war they ushered in, did not change day-to-day life in every city and town in the United States quite the way the coronavirus did. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times One president lost his job in large part for mishandling a crisis whose magnitude he first denied. His successor knows his legacy depends on bringing the catastrophe to a swift conclusion. The halting response demonstrated both the worst of American governance and then, from Operation Warp Speed’s 10-month sprint to vaccines to the frantic pace of inoculations in recent days, the very best. The economic earthquake as cities and towns shuttered so altered politics that Congress did something that would have been unimaginable a year ago this week. Lawmakers spent $5 trillion to dig the nation out of the economic hole created by the virus, and almost as a political aftershock, enacted an expansion of the social safety net larger than any seen since the creation of Medicare nearly 60 years ago. No country can go through this kind of trauma without being forever changed. There were indelible moments. In the spring came the racial reckoning brought on by the death of George Floyd after a police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. On Jan. 6 came the mob attack on the Capitol that led many to wonder whether American democracy was still capable of self-correction. But Biden’s message on Thursday centered on the theme that the country did finally come together in a common cause — vaccines as the road to normalcy — and from that could spring a glimmer of unity, as a still divided nation seeks solace in millions of tiny jabs in the arm. In his speech, Biden held out two distinct dates of hope: May 1, when all adults in the United States will be eligible to receive a vaccine, and July 4, when modest Independence Day celebrations might resemble life a little like it once was. Jill Lepore, a Harvard historian whose book “These Truths” tracks the changing dynamics of technology and society in America since its discovery, wondered if Americans were unconsciously considering the new year as starting in late March, as it did in Britain and its colonies until the calendar changed in 1752. “Or maybe it begins the day you get your vaccine,” she said. “Or the day enough of us get a vaccine.” For Biden, the question is when he will be able to pivot from what he has called the “rescue” phase of the pandemic to the “recovery” phase after the pandemic. In his speech on Thursday, the president made it clear that the rescue was still underway. His goal, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, said in an interview, is “laying up the next steps in this rescue and what, now that we’ve got this bill passed, are we really going to do in the coming months to get back toward a more normal way of life in this country.” All of Biden’s instincts tell him that declaring a move to recovery too soon carries dangers. It would signal that states could follow the example of Texas, eliminating mask mandates, opening restaurants and bars too quickly, and making themselves vulnerable to a resurgence — what Biden called “Neanderthal thinking.” He said as much in the speech, arguing, “This is not the time to let up.” “We need everyone to get vaccinated,” he said, an unspoken recognition that soon there may be more supply than willing takers. “Keep wearing a mask,” because “beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.” Though Biden made no mention of it, his top Cabinet members have emphasized that even eliminating the virus at home is not enough. As his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said last month, “Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it’s also going to be mutating.” “And if it’s mutating,” he added, “it’s also going to come back and bite people everywhere.” But the subtext of Biden’s message on Thursday evening, was that for the first time, people can begin to imagine a post-COVID world. After a year behind closed doors, the government can start to think about managing the virus to the point where it does not drive every policy decision, and families can find a way to go to dinner, or visit grandparents, without wondering whether it is a life-or-death decision. All of which raises the question of what will be permanently changed and what, when the history of this national trauma is written, will prove recoverable. And what will the country have learned? The past provides a mixed guide. There were too few lessons gleaned from the 1918 pandemic, an event that most history books overlooked, and that many Americans first heard about in any detail a century later, when it returned to afflict the nation in a different form. But in 1918, as in 2020, the president’s instinct was to play down its severity, invoking the odd logic that Americans would be dispirited by the truth even as their family and friends succumbed around them. President Donald Trump has never been a student of history (although his grandfather Frederick Trump died of the flu in 1918), and he told journalist Bob Woodward that “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down,” because “I don’t want to create a panic.” No one will know how many thousands of lives that cost as Trump ridiculed mask-wearing and did so little to promote the vaccine in the last days of his administration when it moved from laboratory to market in record time. “Denials for days, weeks, then months,” Biden said Thursday night, without ever mentioning his predecessor by name. “That led to more deaths, more infections, more stress and more loneliness." Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom Biden deliberately made his top medical adviser, also referred to those unnecessary deaths on Thursday when he said on NBC that a year ago this week, “it would have shocked me completely” to know that more than half a million Americans would die of the disease. But he noted that the country paid a horrific price for its political divisions. “Even simple common-sense health measures took on a political connotation,” he said. “It wasn’t a pure public health approach. It was very much influenced by the divisiveness we have in this country.” When Trump and his wife received the vaccine in January, they did not make it public. It was left to Biden and members of his administration to be inoculated on live television as an encouragement to those Americans fearful of the vaccine. The second big lesson may be that when properly organized, the same government that mobilized for World War II and landed men on the moon can in fact save lives on a mass scale. To the Biden administration, that meant taking the vaccines developed in record time and devising a vital distribution system. Operation Warp Speed “was very important work, and I don’t mean to minimize it,” Klain said. “But there was no plan for how we were going to get this vaccine into the arms of tens, and ultimately hundreds, of millions of Americans.” When the history of this strange moment is written, Biden will almost certainly be credited for getting a quarter of the adult population vaccinated with at least one shot, and 10% fully vaccinated, in his first 50 days. After years in which government was denigrated as more of an impediment to national greatness than a vehicle of progress, when conspiracy theories about a pernicious “deep state” still abound, he made the case on Thursday night that a simple show of government competence was itself a turning point. “What we don’t know is whether that translates into encouraging people into public service, or at least trusting that the government can get something done right,” said Richard Haass, a longtime diplomat and now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “After 9/11, we rose to the task of fighting global terrorism. After COVID-19, we rose to a different task.” “It remains to be seen,” he said, “whether we can now also use the moment to lessen the effects of domestic division.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company'}

This whole thing is! We\'ve got all the damn cases," Trump yelled at Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, during a gathering of top aides in the Oval Office on Aug. 19. "I want to do what Mexico does. They don\'t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you\'re vomiting."Mexico\'s record in fighting the virus was hardly one for the United States to emulate. But the president had long seen testing not as a vital way to track and contain the pandemic but as a mechanism for making him look bad by driving up the number of known cases.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAnd on that day he was especially furious after being informed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, that it would be days before the government could give emergency approval to the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment, something Trump was eager to promote as a personal victory going into the Republican National Convention the following week."They\'re Democrats! They\'re against me!" he said, convinced that the government\'s top doctors and scientists were conspiring to undermine him. "They want to wait!"Throughout late summer and fall, in the heat of a reelection campaign that he would go on to lose, and in the face of mounting evidence of a surge in infections and deaths far worse than in the spring, Trump\'s management of the crisis -- unsteady, unscientific and colored by politics all year -- was in effect reduced to a single question: What would it mean for him?The result, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former administration officials and others in contact with the White House, was a lose-lose situation. Trump not only ended up soundly defeated by Joe Biden, but missed his chance to show that he could rise to the moment in the final chapter of his presidency and meet the defining challenge of his tenure.Efforts by his aides to persuade him to promote mask wearing, among the simplest and most effective ways to curb the spread of the disease, were derailed by his conviction that his political base would rebel against anything that would smack of limiting their personal freedom. Even his own campaign\'s polling data to the contrary could not sway him.His explicit demand for a vaccine by Election Day -- a push that came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting with top health aides in late September -- became a misguided substitute for warning the nation that failure to adhere to social distancing and other mitigation efforts would contribute to a slow-rolling disaster this winter.His concern? That the man he called "Sleepy Joe" Biden, who was leading him in the polls, would get credit for a vaccine, not him.The government\'s public health experts were all but silenced by the arrival in August of Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the Stanford professor of neuroradiology recruited after appearances on Fox News.With Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House virus task force, losing influence and often on the road, Atlas became the sole doctor Trump listened to. His theories, some of which scientists viewed as bordering on the crackpot, were exactly what the president wanted to hear: The virus is overblown, the number of deaths are exaggerated, testing is overrated, lockdowns do more harm than good.As the gap between politics and science grew, the infighting that Trump had allowed to plague the administration\'s response from the beginning only intensified. Threats of firings worsened the leadership vacuum as key figures undercut each other and distanced themselves from responsibility.The administration had some positive stories to tell. Trump\'s vaccine development program, Operation Warp Speed, had helped drive the pharmaceutical industry\'s remarkably fast progress in developing several promising approaches. By the end of the year, two highly effective vaccines would be approved for emergency use, providing hope for 2021.The White House rejected any suggestions that the president\'s response had fallen short, saying he had worked to provide adequate testing, protective equipment and hospital capacity and that the vaccine development program had succeeded in record time."President Trump has led the largest mobilization of the public and private sectors since WWII to defeat COVID-19 and save lives," said Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesperson.But Trump\'s unwillingness to put aside his political self-centeredness as Americans died by the thousands each day or to embrace the steps necessary to deal with the crisis remains confounding even to some administration officials. "Making masks a culture war issue was the dumbest thing imaginable," one former senior adviser said.His own bout with COVID-19 in early October left him extremely ill and dependent on care and drugs not available to most Americans, including a still-experimental monoclonal antibody treatment, and he saw firsthand how the disease coursed through the White House and some of his close allies.Yet his instinct was to treat that experience not as a learning moment or an opportunity for empathy, but as a chance to portray himself as a Superman who had vanquished the disease. His own experience to the contrary, he assured a crowd at the White House just a week after his hospitalization, "It\'s going to disappear; it is disappearing."Weeks after his own recovery, he would still complain about the nation\'s preoccupation with the pandemic."All you hear is COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID," Trump said at one campaign stop, uttering the word 11 times.In the end he could not escape it.\'The Base Will Revolt\'By late July, new cases were at record highs, defying Trump\'s predictions through the spring that the virus was under control, and deaths were spiking to alarming levels. Herman Cain, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate, died from the coronavirus. The previous month he had attended a Trump rally without a mask.With the pandemic defining the campaign despite Trump\'s efforts to make it about law and order, Tony Fabrizio, the president\'s main pollster, came to the Oval Office for a meeting in the middle of the summer prepared to make a surprising case: that mask wearing was acceptable even among Trump\'s supporters.Arrayed in front of the Resolute Desk, Trump\'s advisers listened as Fabrizio presented the numbers. According to his research, some of which was reported by The Washington Post, voters believed the pandemic was bad and getting worse, they were more concerned about getting sick than about the virus\'s effects on their personal financial situation, the president\'s approval rating on handling the pandemic had hit new lows and a little more than half the country did not think he was taking the situation seriously.But what set off debate that day was Fabrizio\'s finding that more than 70% of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans.Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a "no-brainer."Kushner had some reason for optimism. Trump had agreed to wear one not long before for a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after finding one he believed he looked good in: dark blue, with a presidential seal.But Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff -- backed up by other aides including Stephen Miller -- said the politics for Trump would be devastating."The base will revolt," Meadows said, adding that he was not sure Trump could legally make it happen in any case.That was all Trump needed to hear. "I\'m not doing a mask mandate," he concluded.Aside from when he was sick, he was rarely seen in a mask again.The president had other opportunities to show leadership rather than put his political fortunes first.After he recovered from his bout with the virus, some of his top aides, including Kushner and Jason Miller, a senior campaign strategist, thought the illness offered an opportunity to demonstrate the kind of compassion and resolve about the pandemic\'s toll that Trump had so far failed to show.When Trump returned from the hospital, his communications aides, with the help of Ivanka Trump, his daughter, urged him to deliver a national address in which he would say: "I had it. It was tough, it kicked my ass, but we\'re going to get through it."He refused, choosing instead to address a boisterous campaign rally for himself from the balcony of the White House overlooking the South Lawn.Trump never came around to the idea that he had a responsibility to be a role model, much less that his leadership role might require him to publicly acknowledge hard truths about the virus -- or even to stop insisting that the issue was not a rampaging pandemic but too much testing.Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, briefed the president this fall on a Japanese study documenting the effectiveness of face masks, telling him: "We have the proof. They work." But the president resisted, criticizing Kushner for pushing them and again blaming too much testing -- an area Kushner had been helping to oversee -- for his problems."I\'m going to lose," Trump told Kushner during debate preparations. "And it\'s going to be your fault, because of the testing."Morgenstern, the White House spokesperson, said that exchange between the president and Kushner "never happened."Azar, who was sometimes one of the few people wearing a mask at White House events, privately bemoaned what he called a political, anti-mask culture set by Trump. At White House Christmas parties, Azar asked maskless guests to back away from him.Divisions and DisagreementsThe decision to run the government\'s response out of the West Wing was made in the early days of the pandemic. The idea was to break down barriers between disparate agencies, assemble public health expertise and encourage quick and coordinated decision-making.It did not work out like that, and by fall the consequences were clear.Trump had always tolerated if not encouraged clashes among subordinates, a tendency that in this case led only to policy paralysis, confusion about who was in charge and a lack of a clear, consistent message about how to reduce the risks from the pandemic.Keeping decision-making power close to him was another Trump trait, but in this case it also elevated the myriad choices facing the administration to the presidential level, bogging the process down in infighting, raising the political stakes and encouraging aides to jockey for favor with Trump.The result at times was a systemwide failure that extended well beyond the president."What we needed was a coordinated response that involved contributions from multiple agencies," said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the Trump administration."Someone needed to pull that all together early," he said. "It wasn\'t the job of the White House, either. This needed to happen closer to the agencies. That didn\'t happen on testing, or on a whole lot of other things."The relationship between Azar and Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, grew increasingly tense; by early November, they were communicating only by text and in meetings.Birx had lost the clout she enjoyed early on in the crisis and spent much of the summer and fall on the road counseling governors and state health officials.Meadows was at odds with almost everyone as he sought to impose the president\'s will on scientists and public health professionals. In conversations with top health officials, Meadows would rail against regulatory "bureaucrats" he thought were more interested in process than outcome.Some of the doctors on the task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, were reluctant to show up in person at the White House, worried that the disdain there for mask wearing and social distancing would leave them at risk of infection.Vice President Mike Pence was nominally in charge of the task force but was so cautious about getting crosswise with Trump as they battled for reelection that, in public at least, he became nearly invisible.The debates inside the White House increasingly revolved around Atlas, who had no formal training in infectious diseases but whose views -- which Trump saw him deliver on Fox News -- appealed to the president\'s belief that the crisis was overblown.His arrival at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. was itself something of a mystery. Some aides said he was discovered by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary. Others said John McEntee, the president\'s personnel chief, had been Googling for a Trump-friendly doctor who would be loyal.Marc Short, Pence\'s chief of staff, opposed hiring Atlas. But once the president and his team brought him in, Short insisted that Atlas have a seat at the task force table, hoping to avoid having him become yet another internal -- and destructive -- critic.Once inside, Atlas used the perch of a West Wing office to shape the response. During a meeting in early fall, Atlas asserted that college students were at no risk from the virus. We should let them go back to school, he said. It\'s not a problem.Birx exploded. What aspect of the fact that you can be asymptomatic and still spread it do you not understand? she demanded. You might not die, but you can give it to somebody who can die from it. She was livid."Your strategy is literally going to cost us lives," she yelled at Atlas. She attacked Atlas\' ideas in daily emails she sent to senior officials. And she was mindful of a pact she had made with Hahn, Fauci and Redfield even before Atlas came on board: They would stick together if one of them was fired for doing what they considered the right thing.Health officials often had a hard time finding an audience in the upper reaches of the West Wing. In a mid-November task force meeting, they issued a dire warning to Meadows about the looming surge in cases set to devastate the country. Meadows demanded data to back up their claim.One outcome of the meeting was a Nov. 19 news conference on the virus\'s dire threat, the first in many weeks. But while Pence, who led the briefing, often urged Americans to "do their part" to slow the spread of the virus, he never directly challenged Trump\'s hesitancy on masks and social distancing. At the briefing, he said that "decision-making at the local level" was key, continuing a long pattern of the administration seeking to push responsibility to the states.Azar had been cut out of key decision-making as early as February, when Pence took over the task force. Azar would complain to his associates that Pence\'s staff and task force members went around him to issue orders to his subordinates.On tenterhooks about his job status, Azar found an opening that offered a kind of redemption, steering his attention through the summer and fall to Operation Warp Speed, the government\'s effort to support rapid development of a vaccine, lavishing praise on Trump and crediting him for nearly every advance.Behind the scenes, Azar portrayed Hahn to the White House as a flailing manager -- a complaint he also voiced about Redfield. In late September, he told the White House he was willing to fire Hahn, according to officials familiar with the offer.For their part, Hahn, Redfield, Birx and other senior health officials saw Azar as crushing the morale of the agencies he oversaw as he sought to escape blame for a worsening crisis and to strengthen his own image publicly and with the White House.Health officials on the task force several times took their complaints about Azar to Pence\'s office, hoping for an intervention.Caitlin B. Oakley, a spokesperson for Azar, said he had "always stood up for balanced, scientific, public health information and insisted that science and data drive the decisions."Once eager to visit the White House, Hahn became disillusioned with what he saw as its efforts to politicize the work of the Food and Drug Administration, and he eventually shied away from task force meetings, fearing his statements there would leak.If there was a bureaucratic winner in this West Wing cage match, it was Atlas.He told Trump that the right way to think about the virus was how much "excess mortality" there was above what would have been expected without a pandemic.Trump seized on the idea, often telling aides that the real number of dead was no more than 10,000 people.As of Thursday, 342,577 Americans had died from the pandemic.Trump vs. Vaccine RegulatorsIn an Oval Office meeting with senior health officials on Sept. 24, the president made explicit what he had long implied: He wanted a vaccine before the election, according to three people who witnessed his demand.Pfizer\'s chief executive had been encouraging the belief that the company could deliver initial results by late October. But Trump\'s aides tried in vain to make clear that they could not completely control the timing.Fauci and Hahn reminded West Wing officials that a company\'s vaccine trial results were a "black box," impossible to see until an independent monitoring board revealed them. A vaccine that did not go through the usual, rigorous government approval process would be a "Pyrrhic victory," Azar told them. It would be a shot no one would take.Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, said the president never asked him to deliver a vaccine on a specific timetable. But he said Trump sometimes complained in meetings that "it was not going to happen before the election and it will be \'Sleepy Joe\'" who would ultimately get credit.In late October, science and regulations worked against Trump\'s waning hopes for pre-Election Day good news. At the FDA, scientists had refined the standards for authorizing a vaccine for emergency use. And at Pfizer, executives realized that the agency was unlikely to authorize its vaccine on the basis of so few COVID-19 cases among its clinical trial volunteers.They decided to wait for more data, a delay of up to a week.When Pfizer announced on Nov. 9 -- two days after Biden clinched his victory -- that its vaccine was a stunning success, Trump was furious. He lashed out at the company, Hahn and the FDA, accusing "deep state regulators" of conspiring with Pfizer to slow approval until after the election.The president\'s frustration with the pace of regulatory action would continue into December, as the FDA went through a time-consuming process of evaluating Pfizer\'s data and then that of a second vaccine maker, Moderna.On Dec. 11, Meadows exploded during a morning call with Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, the agency\'s top vaccine regulator. He accused Hahn of mismanagement and suggested he resign, then slammed down the phone. That night, the FDA authorized the Pfizer vaccine.In the weeks that followed, Pence, Azar, Fauci and other health officials rolled up their sleeves to be vaccinated for the cameras.Trump, who after contracting COVID-19 had declared himself immune, has not announced plans to be vaccinated.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company'}

Roughly one year since the first known death by the coronavirus in the United States, an unfathomable toll is nearing — the loss of a half-million people. No other country has counted so many deaths in the pandemic. More Americans have perished from COVID-19 than on the battlefields of World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War combined. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The milestone comes at a hopeful moment: New virus cases are down sharply, deaths are slowing, and vaccines are steadily being administered. But there is concern about emerging variants of the virus, and it may be months before the pandemic is contained. Each death has left untold numbers of mourners, a ripple effect of loss that has swept over towns and cities. Each death has left an empty space in communities across America: a bar stool where a regular used to sit, one side of a bed unslept in, a home kitchen without its cook. The living find themselves amid vacant places once occupied by their spouses, parents, neighbors and friends — the nearly 500,000 coronavirus dead. In Chicago, the Rev.

That spot belonged to Moses Jones, his uncle, who liked to drive to church in his green Chevy Malibu, arrive early and chat everybody up before settling in to his seat by the door. He died of the coronavirus in April. “I can still see him there,” said Jones, the pastor. “It never goes away.” There is a street corner in Plano, Texas, that was occupied by Bob Manus, a veteran crossing guard who shepherded children to school for 16 years, until he fell ill in December. In the Twin Cities of Minnesota, LiHong Burdick, 72, another victim of the coronavirus, is missing from the groups she cherished: one for playing bridge, another for mahjong and another for polishing her English. At her empty town house, the holiday decorations are still up. There are cards lined up on the mantel. “You walk in, and it smells like her,” said her son, Keith Bartram. “Seeing the chair she would sit in, the random things around the house, it’s definitely very surreal. I went over there yesterday and had a little bit of a breakdown. It’s hard to be in there when it looks like she should be there, but she’s not.” The Spaces Left Empty The virus has reached every corner of America, devastating dense cities and rural counties alike. By now, about 1 in 670 Americans has died of it. In New York City, more than 28,000 people have died of the virus — or 1 in 295 people. In Los Angeles County, which has lost nearly 20,000 people to COVID-19, about 1 in 500 people has died of the virus. In Lamb County, Texas, where 13,000 people live scattered on a sprawling expanse of 1,000 square miles, 1 in 163 people has died of the virus. Across America, the holes in communities, punctured by sudden death, have remained. In Anaheim, California, Monica Alvarez looks at the kitchen in the house she shared with her parents and thinks of her father, Jose Roberto Alvarez. Jose Alvarez, 67, a maintenance supervisor, worked the overnight shift until he died from the virus in July. Before he got sick, he would come home from his usual workday and prepare an early-morning meal. Monica Alvarez, beginning her workday as an accountant from her computer in the nearby dining room, would chat with him while he scrambled a plate of eggs. “With his passing, we’ve rearranged some rooms in the house,” she said. “I don’t work in the dining room anymore. I’m glad for that. I’m sad, but I’m glad. It’s a reminder, being there.” The physical emptiness is next to Andrea Mulcahy on the couch in her house in Florida, where her husband, Tim, who worked at a cellular telephone company, loved to sit. “We would hold hands, or sometimes I would put my hand on his leg,” Mulcahy said. Her husband, who believed that he contracted the virus from a co-worker, died in July at the age of 52. They used to go on adventures, road trips and cruises in the Caribbean, but Mulcahy is not sure she wants to travel without him. They had dreams of someday moving to a quaint town in Kentucky, on the Cumberland River, and retiring there. She said it was difficult even to stop at the grocery store without her husband, who liked to goof around and entertain her while they shopped. Now she sees a display of Oreos, his favorite cookies, and breaks down in tears. A Staggering Toll One year ago, as the coronavirus took hold in the United States, few public health experts predicted its death toll would climb to such a terrible height. At a White House briefing March 31, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the country, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who was coordinating the coronavirus response at the time, announced a stunning projection: Even with strict stay-at-home orders, the virus might kill as many as 240,000 Americans. “As sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it,” Fauci said at the time. Less than a year later, the virus has killed more than twice that number. The virus has disproportionately caused the deaths of Americans in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, where infections spread easily among vulnerable residents: They account for more than 163,000 deaths, about one-third of the country’s total. In New Hampshire, 73% of COVID-19 deaths were linked to nursing homes through last week. In Minnesota, it was 62%. The coronavirus has been especially lethal to Americans 65 and older, who account for about 81% of the country’s COVID-19 deaths. One of them was a man nearly everyone called Mr. Bob. Bob Manus, 79, was an unmistakable presence on the corner of Clark and Yeary in Plano, Texas. There was his black whistle, hanging around his neck on a lanyard — sharp, shrill and authoritative. A neon vest that he wore as part of his safety uniform. And his careful way with the children he guided across the street each morning and afternoon. “He knew the families. He knew their dogs,” said Ann Lin, who lives nearby and walks her children to school. After Manus died of the coronavirus in January, the block changed, she said. “There’s a noticeable difference now. It’s this heaviness. And it’s a reminder of what COVID took.” A group of parents has planned an honorary plaque to be erected at the spot where Manus worked. “My kids were devastated,” said Sarah Kissel, the PTA president. “They went from seeing him every day to him never coming back.” Manus has not yet been replaced. For now, his corner sits empty. ‘There’s Always This Hope’ Ignacio Silverio and his sister, Leticia Silverio, used to have a ritual. They would meet and chat over coffee in her restaurant, Cheliz, which she opened in their hometown, Redlands, California, four years ago. Ignacio Silverio still comes by the restaurant. But now his sister is gone, after dying from the coronavirus in August at the age of 40. Her husband has kept the restaurant operating, a main source of income. Other family members have pitched in to help. “When I go inside, it’s a surreal moment, and there’s always this hope,” Ignacio Silverio said. “You know, maybe it’s all a dream, and she would greet me, and we would sit down together and drink coffee.” Some families have moved away from the places that are so painfully entwined with memories. In April, Karlee Greer picked up her father, Michael Horton, 66, from the hospital where he had been battling the coronavirus. The doctors said he was ready to continue his recovery at home, and Greer had him stay with her family, setting him up in a bed in her daughter’s room. Four days later, he died there, without warning. Even now, 10 months after her father’s death, Greer remains haunted by the space. “Every time I walk into my daughter’s room, it’s like I see him there,” she said. “I see him around the whole house. I can’t stand to be there.” On Friday, the family moved out, hoping that a new home would bring new memories. The feeling of loss throughout the United States goes beyond physical spaces. “People are feeling a psychological and spiritual void,” said Paddy Lynch, a funeral director in Michigan who has worked with families who have lost relatives to the coronavirus. Part of that void, he said, comes from the missing rituals, the lack of a communal catharsis after a death. Aldene Sans, 90, once a stay-at-home mother who raised five children in Illinois, died in December while living in a nursing home that was ravaged by the virus. Her funeral service was kept small, an effort to make sure the gathering was safe. “It was sad and so strange,” said her daughter Becky Milstead. “Only nine people were there.” ‘Sad Day in Our History’ As the United States approaches 500,000 deaths from the coronavirus, there are few events in history that adequately compare. The 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have killed about 675,000 Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, when the country’s population was one-third of what it is now. But it also happened at a time when influenza vaccines, antibiotics, mechanical ventilation and other medical tools did not exist yet. Drew Gilpin Faust, a historian and former president of Harvard University, said medical and societal achievements in the United States had caused many Americans to believe that “we were ready for anything — that we had conquered nature.” “When there were field hospitals in Central Park, and bodies piled up because there was no capacity to bury them, we were just so shocked at ourselves and had not thought this would ever happen to us,” said Faust, whose book “This Republic of Suffering” explores how Americans grappled with death after the Civil War. “That sense of mastery over nature has been so seriously challenged by this pandemic.” Deaths from COVID-19 in the United States came faster as the pandemic went on. The first known death occurred in February 2020, and by May 27, 100,000 people had died. It took four months for the nation to log another 100,000 deaths; the next, about three months; the next, just five weeks. Although daily deaths are now slowing, about 1,900 deaths in America are being reported each day. As of late Saturday night, the toll had reached 497,403. “This will be a sad day in our history,” said Dr. Ali Mokdad, a public health researcher at the University of Washington. “Our grandchildren and future generations will look back at us and blame us for the biggest failure in facing a pandemic, in the country that’s the richest country in the world. That we allowed people to die, that we didn’t protect our vulnerable populations — Native American, Hispanic and African Americans. That we did not protect our essential workers.” It will still take months to vaccinate the American public, and new, more contagious variants of the virus could quickly undo the nation’s progress and lead to another spike. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent global health research center at the University of Washington, has projected that the nation could reach more than 614,000 deaths by June 1. Factors like how well people adhere to guidelines like mask-wearing and social distancing, plus the speed of vaccinations, could affect that estimate. Mark Buchanan, manager at the Side Door Saloon in Petoskey, Michigan, has been thinking of the stool where his friend Larry Cummings, a professor, used to sit on Monday nights for a chat, some football and a glass of ice water. “It was like 9:10 every Monday,” Buchanan said. “We knew that when the door opened, it was Larry walking in.” Cummings’ widow, Shannon, said she had tried to take comfort in knowing that her husband, who died of COVID-19 in March at the age of 76, had a full, meaningful life, rich with family, friends and travel. But ever since he died, she has been sleeping on his side of the bed. “By doing so, this space isn’t empty,” she said. She recently cleaned out her husband’s university office and sifted through everything he had tucked away there: a collection of political buttons, handwritten cards from their daughters and a file of papers from an extended trip they were supposed to take to the Balkans last summer. This month, she finally sold his car, a Volvo sedan, that had been sitting unused for much of the past year. “I didn’t realize how hard it would be to sell it,” she said. “It hit me in a way that surprised me and shocked me. It was admitting that he’s really not here.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company'}

{'_id': '980a26fce6dc7882509c1fcca85c018c', 'title': 'Here’s How Trump’s Supreme Court Will Put the Screws To President Biden', 'description': 'You weren’t the only one who missed it when the newly radicalized Supreme Court issued a stark warning last month that it may use the coronavirus pandemic to attack the power of the executive branch, potentially hamstringing President Joe Biden and Democratic governors in the midst of the greatest crisis America has faced since World War II.The threat went mostly unnoticed because it came as the nation’s highest court passed on the opportunity to rule upon an audacious challenge to a governor’s power to protect the public health during the height of the outbreak.But the decision made the court’s intentions clear, and also raised a warning flag about the imminent threat the court poses to both public health and America’s constitutional order.The Supreme Court’s Dangerous New Crusade Against Science Is Just BeginningThe story began as winter approached last year and Kentucky, like a number of states, faced an imminent third wave of the pandemic on the verge of getting out of control. Seeking to avoid a catastrophe, the state’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, responded by implementing a number of emergency public health measures including limitations on the size of indoor gatherings, a temporary ban on indoor seating at bars and restaurants, and limits on the size of weddings and funerals—as well as the closure of K-12 schools to in-person instruction from late November to early January, to be followed by a hybrid instruction model thereafter.While these measures, like many taken by responsible government officials throughout the pandemic, were burdensome, Beshear’s record more than merited public confidence. He had been a leader in taking proactive measures to limit the spread of the virus. Acting with the advice of his health commissioner, a former president of the American Medical Association, Beshear, among other things, made an early declaration of a state of emergency and imposed targeted social distancing mandates that had substantially constrained the rates of infection in his state.The contrast with Kentucky’s neighbor Tennessee is notable. Tennessee currently had a positivity rate of 21.7 percent, while Kentucky’s rate is 15.6 percent. Under Republican Governor Bill Lee, Tennessee had waited until late December to mandate new social gathering restrictions and the state government still does not require mask-wearing, even as it faces one of the most uncontrolled outbreaks in the country.Kentuckians apparently recognize the merits of Beshear’s leadership. A recent poll found that he has a 59 percent overall approval rating, and that 58 percent of the state’s residents approve of his handling of the pandemic. Furthermore, the same poll found a 77 percent approval rate for Beshear’s indoor mask mandate, a 55 percent percent approval rate for his limit on indoor gatherings, and 62 percent support for his temporary school closure order.Yet, despite Beshear’s demonstrable record of relative success in following a science-based response to the pandemic, the governor, a Democrat in a GOP dominated state, has been met throughout 2020 by a barrage of Republican attacks upon his efforts to control the outbreak. For example, state legislators have declared an intention to seek to limit the governor’s authority to protect the public health during the emergency; and Senator Rand Paul recently made an absurd, evidence-free declaration that Beshear’s coronavirus restrictions have done nothing to curb the pandemic.It therefore should come as no surprise that, immediately after Beshear implemented his most recent measures to mitigate the growing threat to the public health of Tennesseans, the state’s entire GOP establishment set about criticizing them. Republican leaders ultimately placed their focus on an unusual, and absurd, constitutional challenge to the governor’s temporary school closure order, brought by private religious schools.The religious schools claimed that the governor’s school closure order violated their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. The obvious problem, however, was that the temporary closure order was not directed at religious schools, but rather applied to all K-12 schools in the state—and the Supreme Court had long recognized that the First Amendment is not violated by a governmental regulation of general applicability that has an incidental impact on religious practice.Furthermore, until recently, courts have been extremely reticent to interfere with the public health judgments of state and federal executive branch officials, particularly during times of emergency. Based on that principle, the Supreme Court twice rejected efforts in 2020 to void science-based public health regulations that limited in-person religious worship services, reasoning that the “Constitution principally entrusts ‘[t]he safety and the health of the people’ to the politically accountable officials of the States ‘to guard and protect.’”Given those precedents, it is unsurprising that, while a GOP-appointed judge initially ruled in favor of the religious schools challenge to Beshear’s order, an intermediate appellate court issued a decision upholding the order.But the Supreme Court is an institution in flux, due to its packing—along with much of the rest of the federal judiciary—with extremist Trump nominees. And the level of the Supreme Court’s deference towards state officials’ response to the pandemic has changed with the ascension of Trump’s third appointee to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett.The Supreme Court Has a Long History of Thwarting Democracy. Justice Amy Coney Barrett Is About to Add to It.In November, by a 5-4 vote with Barrett casting the deciding vote, the court overruled its recent decision in a lawsuit brought by the Brooklyn Catholic Diocese and an association of Jewish congregations. The court enjoined a regulation imposed by Governor Andrew Cuomo that temporarily limited the size of religious services in areas with high infection rates as part of a comprehensive, science-based regulatory scheme that has, at least until recently, tamed what was a raging pandemic in the state.While itself radical, and unprecedented, the New York decision was at least grounded in a contention that Cuomo had “targeted” religious practice for an unfair burden. Indeed, the court went so far as to suggest that Cuomo may have “gerrymandered” the affected districts so as to impact certain Orthodox Jewish synagogues. By contrast, there was no colorable basis to charge Beshear with singling out religion by imposing an order that closed all schools in the state, the vast majority of which are public, non-religious institutions.Yet several of the most reactionary justices on a now extremely right-wing court had given a clear indication that their intention extended beyond protecting religion from improper government regulation and that—like the GOP’s political leadership—their actual agenda was to undermine the authority and power of government itself, at least when the government at issue is run by an elected official from the Democratic Party.During the four years of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court has been notably deferential toward presidential power, and—with a few notable examples—has gone far out of its way to uphold even the most extreme exercises of executive power by the president.But in a speech he gave before the Federalist Society days after Trump’s electoral loss, Justice Samuel Alito expressed nothing short of alarm at what he described as the danger of governors and presidents grasping to wield power through appointed officials, at the expense of state and federal legislative branches, and—in Alito’s view—acting beyond their constitutional authority.Echoing reasoning that the so-called Lochner-era Supreme Court employed to strike down New Deal federal programs early in Franklin Roosevelt’s administration, Alito argued that “appointed experts” sitting in government agencies were assuming what amounted to legislative authority, and in the process, seeking to make government operate “more scientific[ally]”—a development Alito apparently found alarming. Alito clearly indicated that these overreaching officials needed to be reined in, presumably by the courts.Alito went on to suggest that one of the battle lines in the coming struggle against scientifically informed government expertise would be the pandemic, because, the justice warned, “elite groups” of supposedly power-hungry experts were taking advantage of the catastrophic health emergency to gain power for themselves through the exercise of “enormous executive discretion,” in the name of protecting the public.In his concurrence in the Brooklyn decision, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed Alito’s tirade against the danger of scientifically informed elected officials, expressing outrage at the audacity of the (largely Democratic) elected officials who have, “with the flick of a pen” taken decisive actions to protect their citizens from a deadly virus. Thus, Gorsuch made clear that the court was sending a message to Cuomo and his ilk that their days of acting with impunity to protect their constituents, under cover of a deadly health emergency, were numbered.The apparent eagerness of some justices to teach a lesson to “Democrat” governors—and by implication, the incoming Democratic president—must have been whetted when former White House Counsel Don McGahn (who was largely responsible for selecting many of Trump’s judicial nominees) submitted a brief on behalf of Mitch McConnell and other GOP Senators. McGahn suggested that Beshear—who, along with his wife, is a church deacon—has a systemic “lack of regard for Free Exercise rights.” McGahn conveniently omitted the fact that, even as Beshear imposed other restrictions during the pandemic, he had actually eliminated all restrictions on attendance at worship services.The Supreme Court, however, chose not to immediately enjoin Beshear’s well-founded emergency health measure. Yet, the court’s decision declining to impose an emergency bar on Beshear’s mandates was notably far from definitive. The unsigned majority opinion emphasized that the governor’s order to cease all in-person schooling was set to expire in a matter of days, and furthermore, that some of the arguments challenging the order’s constitutionality had not been properly presented.The decision went on to indicate that the plaintiff religious schools are welcome to reassert their challenges again “if the Governor issues a school-closing order that applies in the new year.” Justices Gorsuch and Alito each issued dissenting opinions (which both joined) underlining, in Alito’s words, that “no one should misinterpret that denial as signifying approval” of the lower appellate court’s decision adhering to long-standing Supreme Court precedent, or of the lower court’s deference to the scientifically grounded judgement of an elected governor. Rather, Alito explained, the “Court’s order[] . . . [was] based primarily on timing.” For his part, Gorsuch emphasized that Beshear had chosen to allow people in Kentucky to go to concerts, while preventing them from “pray[ing] together in a classroom,” and argued in favor of vacating the denial of the injunction, and returning the case to the lower courts for further consideration under the “proper legal standards.”Supreme Court Blocks New York COVID Restrictions on Religious Gatherings Accordingly, rather than definitively rejecting the absurd proposition that a scientifically grounded emergency health regulation that is not directed at, and indeed has only an incidental impact on, religious institutions can somehow violate the Constitution, the court deliberately left the question open.And that should be a red flag for anyone concerned with whether President Biden will have the ability to fully address the unprecedented health crisis that Trump has botched, with catastrophic consequences, for the past year.With the Democrats about to gain an effective majority in the Senate, the GOP’s ability to stymie Biden’s legislative efforts will be more limited. But the now stridently reactionary Supreme Court could pose a great danger to the incoming president’s ability to govern and to save lives. In his Federalist Society speech, Alito wistfully alluded to rulings of the Lochner Court majority that repeatedly voided President Roosevelt’s efforts to respond to the catastrophe of the Depression, and suggested that the current court should likewise act to rein in the so-called administrative state.If Alito, Gorsuch, Barrett and their colleagues have their way, such a reactionary remaking of constitutional law could happen soon, potentially at the cost of many, many more lives.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'b5d096f2d2d1842e8cedadc9f72a7757', 'title': 'The Mother of All Stock-Market Bubbles', 'description': 'By Warren Buffett’s criteria, current stock prices are their most overvalued at least since World War II. In the chart below, the ratio of stock-market value, represented by the Wilshire 5000 index of all public stocks, to GDP is over 25 percent above the previous all-time high, the peak of the NASDAQ stock market bubble in 2000, which is indexed as 100 in the chart. The seemingly relentless rise of the stock market coincides with central-bank balance sheets that have continued to balloon since the Great Financial Crisis. While the major central banks generally do not target stock-market levels directly, a goal of their policies has been to push financial markets towards riskier investments, which, of course, include stocks. Global financial markets are interlinked, so that the actions of international central banks can affect what goes on in the U.S. and vice versa. The following chart compares securities holdings of the major central banks to the level of the U.S. stock market. There is close correspondence between the stock market-level and central-bank securities holdings, but both would be expected to grow with GDP, so the next chart compares the ratio of stock-market valuation to GDP in the first chart with a similar GDP ratio for central-bank assets. As central-bank holdings of debt climb relative to GDP, stock valuations soar in line. Some analysts, including the Fed, cite low real (after inflation) interest rates as justification for high stock valuations. Interest rates certainly affect the market in the short-term, as recently experienced, but, over the long-term, the correlation between real rates and the stock valuation measure in the chart above is less than half that of the liquidity provided by central bank securities purchases. Stocks’ overvaluation is evident to experienced investors scouring markets for historically reasonable values. Meanwhile, the GameStop saga (and there are plenty of other examples to choose from) are uncomfortably reminiscent of some of the excesses of the dotcom bubble. Just because the stock market is overvalued doesn’t mean it can’t get further overvalued. The next chart compares the U.S. stock market for the last decade with the NASDAQ bubble of the 1990s and the Japanese stock market bubble that crashed in the 1990s. While U.S. stocks currently are at Buffett ratio all-time highs, the NASDAQ and Japanese bubbles rose even further from their starting points. The current bubble may do so as well if central banks keep pouring liquidity into the financial markets. What’s clear from the first chart is that the stock-market downturn from the NASDAQ bubble preceded and contributed to the 2000 recession, as has been acknowledged by Fed chair Jerome Powell. The Japanese bubble’s bursting was also linked to a recession. Stocks are an insignificant holding of the U.S. banking system, however, which was largely unaffected by the NASDAQ bubble, although Japanese banks with extensive crossholdings were crippled for years. Posing a greater financial risk than a stock downturn is that historically high valuations permeate the entire financial system. The U.S. stock market is a bellwether for risky assets globally. Differences between borrowing rates for the U.S. government and high-quality investment grade borrowers have fallen significantly and are quite low historically. Rates for the riskiest sub-investment grade “junk bond” borrowers are at all time lows. Future bond market turmoil from the inevitable reversal of maximally easy monetary conditions may pose a threat to financial stability, but the biggest risk to the financial system is a housing downturn, as happened in the Great Financial Crisis. Real estate is the single largest component of banking assets. Fortunately, as illustrated in the following chart, which compares housing prices to income, real-estate values are about 20 percent lower than the overextended levels from the GFC era. Unfortunately, a recent rapid appreciation of housing prices may alter this favorable balance. The chart below shows housing prices appreciating faster than personal incomes by an annualized 20 percent, the fastest such rate recorded. Of course, there is a large rebound following the pandemic, but, should this rate continue, it won’t be long before housing is flashing critical warning signs. The Fed’s December plan was to hold rates at rock bottom levels until unemployment is minimized and inflation surpasses 2 percent, which they expected to take 3 years. Should housing prices continue to appreciate at recent rates, three more years of maximum stimulus would put them well into the GFC danger zone. The pandemic recovery is moving faster than the Fed and many other forecasters expected. In March 2020, the Fed forecast a 6.5 percent decline for the year. Forecasters surveyed in May by the Philadelphia Fed expected a 5.6 percent decline. 2020’s downturn was 3.5 percent, and these same forecasters expect growth over 4 percent for 2021, so overall recovery is in sight. The financial markets are already beginning to bring forward their expectations of when the Fed will begin raising rates (about two years), and it would not surprise if this start anticipating an even closer date in due course. . More years of maximum stimulus would further inflate the stock market bubble and possibly create an even more lethal housing bubble as well. The Fed has been determined to see unemployment all the way down before any tightening, a worthy goal, but even a mild downturn in the wake of a bursting the stock market bubble would have grave consequences following so closely after the pandemic. Creation of another housing bubble would be catastrophic. Depressed business and labor sectors may not fully recover this year, but all the monetary stimulus in the world won’t convert airplanes, bars, and restaurants into homes, nor flight crew and serving staff into home builders, nor into other booming sectors. When the pandemic permits, cash savings are extremely high, and there is plenty of pent-up demand for these people and their services. Single-minded focus on just one goal ignores monetary policy’s significant time lags and complex effects throughout an economy. Now is the time for the Fed to plan to stabilize policy and the markets, and this must be carefully communicated and executed to minimize volatility such as 2013’s “taper tantrum.” While inflation may pop up in the short-term as recovery continues, long-term inflation has been in forty-year decline, so it is unlikely to pose a major problem. The biggest economic risk is financial instability, and, despite its great initial work stanching the pandemic panic, right now the biggest financial instability risk is. . . the Fed.'}

{'_id': 'b8bdbc9fd479840bd5165b6e61b88db6', 'title': 'Trump Tells Pompeo: Go Wild on Iran, Just Don’t Risk ‘World War III’', 'description': 'President Donald Trump may only have seven weeks left in office, but he’s given his top advisers the green light to batter the Iranian regime—anything that doesn’t hazard a full-on war before Joe Biden is inaugurated.According to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the matter, in recent weeks Trump has taken a more passive role in personally overseeing Iran policy for the critical final months until Inauguration Day. One White House official last week described Trump as mostly “checked out” on this major foreign policy issue, having become consumed by his bumbling legal effort to steal the 2020 election amid the coronavirus pandemic, as well as by other his pet grievances of the moment.But Trump has given some of his most hawkish administration officials, particularly his top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, carte blanche to squeeze and punish the Islamic Republic as aggressively as they wish in the coming weeks. All Trump asks is that they don’t risk “start[ing] World War III,” as the president has specifically put it in several private conversations with Pompeo and others, according to two senior administration officials.That has left a host of options at the outgoing administration’s disposal—among them, a suffocating sanctions regime and a studied silence in the face of the assassination of Iranian nationals. Two officials who spoke to The Daily Beast said the administration is set to announce new sanctions on regime-linked companies and individuals in the coming weeks to solidify a years-long effort to paralyze Tehran’s economy.Iran: Israel Killed Top Nuclear Scientist With Remote-Control Machine GunKnowledgeable sources say those actions are designed to help fulfill various Trump officials’ long-brewing desire to make it more difficult for the Democratic president-elect to rekindle negotiations with Tehran and re-enter a nuclear deal. And it’s a scenario for which Biden lieutenants and allies have long prepared, having already factored into their Iran strategy that current U.S. officials would do nearly everything they could to undermine a revival of Obama-era relations between the adversarial nations.Trump administration officials who spoke to The Daily Beast frequently point to Pompeo and Elliott Abrams, special representative for Iran, as the leaders of the administration’s last-ditch attempt at pummeling the regime.Secretary Pompeo has been particularly forward leaning in the administration’s efforts to inflict damage on the Iranian government. In a recent trip to the Middle East, Pompeo met with leaders from Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain on ways all three countries could work together on countering the Islamic Republic. The trip followed on the heels of an announcement by the State Department that it had recently approved a massive sale of F-35 jets to the UAE. The deal has been widely viewed as a way to get Dubai to cooperate with Jerusalem on deterring Iran. And on Friday, Pompeo announced additional Iran-related sanctions, this time targeting Chinese and Russian entities for transferring sensitive technology and items to Iran’s missile program.Both Pompeo and Abrams, officials say, are supportive of harsh measures, including the quiet backing of covert actions carried out by other actors. One other senior administration official pointed to Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel as being intimately involved in the administration’s clandestine strategy as it relates to Iran.The president has repeatedly told his advisers that one of his priorities is to avoid a confrontation with Iran in which American military personnel would die. But Trump is comfortable letting Israel take the lead in targeting, or even slaying, Iranian regime figures in the closing weeks of his presidency, officials said. That includes Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the country’s top nuclear weapons scientist, who was killed Nov. 27 while traveling in a convoy in the northern part of the country.Two senior Trump administration officials said Israel was behind the attack, confirming global suspicions. One of those same officials, while they did not detail the level of involvement from the U.S., noted that America’s intelligence agencies often share information with Israel on Iran-related matters.“There’s obviously a close working relationship between Mossad chief Yossi Cohen and Haspel,” said Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a right leaning think tank that’s advised the Trump administration on Iran.Some of the president’s confidants have urged him not to draw too much attention to the killing. The administration has chosen to remain mostly tight-lipped regarding the scientist’s death. A source close to Trump said they had counseled the president in the past few days to avoid gratuitously tweeting about the assassination. Not only would it be a “bad look,” according to this source, it would likely undermine the administration’s public position of keeping the operation at arm’s length, if not farther away.The two senior administration officials said discussions about taking more active measures to limit Biden’s administration on negotiating a new deal with Iran ramped up this summer and coincided with several of Israel’s covert operations, including the killing of al Qaeda deputy leader Abu Muhammed in Iran, and Israel’s planting of a bomb in one of Iran’s centrifuge facilities.“The Israelis understand that between now and Jan. 20 they will need to inflict maximum damage on the regime,” Dubowitz said.The Trump strategy over the next few weeks is clear, one of the senior administration officials said: Continue to use sanctions as a deterrence tool while providing intelligence to regional allies such as Israel that have a mutual goal of damaging the Iranian regime.That plan isn’t so different from the one the Trump administration has put into action over the past four years. Since Trump took office in 2017, a cohort of top officials, advisers, and external advocacy groups have helped craft and implement a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran that has relied primarily on the implementation of more than 1,000 sanctions on regime-linked officials and companies while also covertly targeting Tehran’s assets overseas.The only difference now, officials say, is that the administration not only wants to punish Iran, it also wants to pen in President-elect Biden.Individuals involved in the crafting of the Trump administration’s Iran policy believe the maximum pressure campaign will limit Biden’s ability to get back on track with Tehran, namely because some of the sanctions may be difficult to lift, especially those focused on human-rights and terrorism. Dubowitz and Trump administration officials familiar with Iranian sanctions said multinational corporations may be so risk averse to doing business with Iran now, following thousands of financial designations, that even if Biden lifts sanctions they will not engage in normal trade relations with Tehran.Individuals familiar with Team Biden’s thinking say the president-elect has a clear strategy for dealing with Iran and sanctions come January. That plan rests heavily on Biden’s desire to return back to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—the nuclear deal negotiated during the Obama administration—if Iran comes back into compliance.How Trump Twisted Iran Intel to Manufacture the ‘Four Embassies’ Threat“If Iran takes the bait, which is clearly the intention behind [the Farikhzadeh assassination], then it probably makes it impossible to return to the JCPOA and diplomacy,” said Jarrett Blanc, the former coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation in the Obama State Department. “If Iran doesn’t take the bait… I don’t know that it really changes the choices that confront the Biden team or Iran in January.”Any negotiations between a Biden administration and Iran would include conversations about the lifting of some sanctions, two individuals familiar with the Biden team’s thinking on Iran said. But those sanctions would likely only be lifted if and when Tehran complies with a deal.“Iran says it is prepared to come back in compliance and reverse some of the decisions it’s made. And the U.S. says it would lift some of the sanctions. [There’s] no legal bar to reverse them. Many of them were imposed for political reasons,” said one former senior Obama administration official. “It’s likely going to be a two-step approach for Biden—getting back in and then perhaps renegotiating a different, better deal.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Kelly Loeffler issued a now-familiar warning during a campaign event Wednesday in Bibb County: If Democrats win the Georgia Senate runoff elections, there will be little left to stem a rising tide of extremist socialism in America.But Dale Washburn, a Republican state legislator who introduced Loeffler at the event, had another warning. This one was based not on ideology, but on numbers that suggest Democrats are outpacing Republicans in early voting turnout -- which means that Republicans may need a tremendous election-day performance Jan. 5 if they are to win the state\'s two high-stakes runoff races and maintain control of the Senate."We\'re fully aware of the energy on the other side, and think we\'ve been reminded about that," Washburn said. "We know demographics have changed in recent years. And if our side hasn\'t been aware of that, they\'re rapidly becoming aware of that. The Biden victory had a big part."Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesLess than a week before election day, the last-minute challenges, messages and strategies for the two parties in Georgia\'s runoffs are coming into focus, even as polls indicate that the elections are too close to call. Those messages will be hammered home on the day before the elections by President-elect Joe Biden, who plans to campaign Monday in Atlanta, and by President Donald Trump, who will hold a rally on the same day in Dalton, a city in northwest Georgia.However, some Republicans are increasingly worried that Trump, who continues to make the baseless claim that he lost Georgia because of a rigged voting system, is sending confusing signals to his followers that may serve to keep them home on election day. On Wednesday, Trump on Twitter pushed for the resignation of Gov. Brian Kemp, a staunch conservative and Trump supporter who has declined to take steps to overturn the state\'s election results.The president argued that Kemp was an "obstructionist who refuses to admit that we won Georgia."As Trump continues to foment a backward-looking drama, Loeffler and her fellow Republican candidate, Sen. David Perdue, have crisscrossed the state, warning of an ominous future if their Democratic opponents, the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, prevail. Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Perdue said the Republicans were a "last line of defense" against centralized government, comparing his struggle to military conflicts like World War II.On "Fox & Friends" on Wednesday morning, he added: "We\'re winning this race right now. Kelly and I are all over this state. We\'re running against two of the most liberal candidates that the Democrats have ever put up."Democrats, for their part, have been crafting messages that they hope will resonate with African Americans, a constituency crucial to Biden\'s narrow victory in Georgia in November. One TV ad released Wednesday for Ossoff featured former President Barack Obama, who says that Ossoff will pass a new voting rights act if elected, while musician John Legend plays a rendition of "Georgia on My Mind."But it is the numbers from early in-person and absentee voting that are particularly troubling for many Republican operatives in the state. Since the start of early voting on Dec. 14, more than 2.5 million Georgians have cast their votes, and the breakdown appears to be mostly good news for Democrats. (The early voting period runs through the end of Friday, but Georgia counties may choose to close polling sites in observance of holidays on New Year\'s Eve and New Year\'s Day.)The breakdown of votes shows that vote-rich Democratic strongholds, including Fulton and DeKalb counties in metropolitan Atlanta, are posting high numbers, while African Americans statewide are "voting their weight and then some," said Charles S. Bullock III, a political scientist at the University of Georgia.At the same time, Bullock noted, turnout has been weak in the northwestern part of the state, which is home to many working-class white Trump supporters. In Walker County, which Trump won with 79% of the vote, the turnout, as of Wednesday, was only 47% of the general election total, according to the website georgiavotes.com.That may explain Trump\'s decision to hold his rally Monday in Dalton, a city known for its flooring and carpet manufacturing. It is also in the heart of the congressional district recently won by Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican best known for espousing elements of the QAnon conspiracy theory.Trump announced the rally Dec. 19. Democrats countered Wednesday with their announcement that Biden would campaign on the same day in Atlanta. On Sunday, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also plans to hold an event in Savannah.Harris\' visit will most likely serve as a force multiplier for Democrats in Savannah, with a leading Black Democrat visiting a predominantly Black city to stump for Warnock, who is also Black and is a Savannah native. The move demonstrates how Democrats have embraced a strategy espoused by Stacey Abrams, the party\'s former candidate for governor, that emphasizes paying attention to, and spending money turning out, the state\'s minority voters.While that strategy appears to have given Democrats an early edge, it remains to be seen if it will be enough to counter a surge of Republican voters who are probably waiting until election day to turn up at the polls, as has traditionally been the case."Democrats have shown up for the early vote, and the overt emphasis on Black voters has seemingly paid off," Brian Robinson, a Republican strategist based in Georgia, said in a text message Wednesday. "Republicans, though, still have a lot of votes out there they can get, particularly in northwest Georgia, where Trump is going Monday. The GOP candidates will win handily among election day voters, so the bigger the turnout Tuesday, the better the Republican chances."But Republicans had similar hopes for Trump in the general election, in which he fell short by about 12,000 votes in Georgia. And it is unclear whether Trump, in his visit to Dalton, will end up motivating his followers or causing more headaches for Republicans.Trump\'s tweet calling for Kemp to resign was already commanding some of the political spotlight Wednesday. At a hastily convened news conference, Kemp did not address Trump\'s comments directly, saying he would not be "distracted" from his goal of electing Perdue and Loeffler. The governor also said he was too focused on responding to the coronavirus pandemic to become involved in political infighting."That horse has left the barn in Georgia," Kemp said of Biden\'s victory in Georgia -- dismissing Trump\'s false claims that the state\'s election was tainted by fraud.How the jockeying plays out will not only affect the balance of power in Washington but also offer the first hints at how both parties navigate the post-Trump political future. Trump has proved to be a unique motivator of the Republican base, and the party is yet to find a figure who is equally adept at maximizing turnout among white conservatives.Democrats are eager to prove that Biden\'s success in November was not a fluke, and that voters want a robust liberal agenda rather than the Republican-led obstructionism that defined Obama\'s administration.Ossoff, who is facing off against Perdue, has sought in particular to make the election a referendum on Republican inaction on the pandemic. The latest issue at hand this week was whether the Republican senators would support a Senate vote on giving Americans stimulus checks of $2,000 rather than $600, a prospect that Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, appeared to dash Wednesday."People are in dire straits," Ossoff said. "And if Senators Perdue and Loeffler -- who are in the majority, and, let\'s be clear, it\'s the majority that controls floor action -- and if they are serious about $2,000 relief checks for the people, then they should put maximum pressure on Mitch McConnell to move that legislation immediately."In a gaggle at her event in Macon, Loeffler avoided the question. Though she has said she supports the increased stimulus checks, she avoided placing pressure on Senate Republican leaders to bring forth the issue on the floor without caveats. Loeffler also avoided another hot-button Republican issue: whether to object to the presidential results on Jan. 6, when the Senate must ratify the Electoral College outcome."Leader McConnell and I have spoken about bringing another relief package," Loeffler said. "But we\'re in this situation because Democrats have blocked relief throughout this summer."Her carefully chosen words highlighted her current political pickle. In both Georgia and Washington, siding with Trump can also mean being in direct opposition to Republicans like McConnell or Kemp.Washburn, the state representative, said the infighting among Republicans had made operating in the state more difficult.He said he worried that the discord, and the Republicans who have questioned whether their votes will count in the runoffs, were hampering turnout for the party."Obviously we would prefer to have complete unity, but the situation is what it is," Washburn said. "And we have to tap down any conversation that your vote doesn\'t matter. Because it does matter."He added, "It\'s definitely a big concern."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company'}
