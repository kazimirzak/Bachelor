Data out on Thursday (Dec 10) showed the economic recovery almost ground to a halt in October as a surge in coronavirus cases hammered the hospitality sector. That was as public authorities in much of the UK barred people from socialising in pubs and restaurants, ahead of a broader four-week partial lockdown across England in November. Gross domestic product rose 0.4% in October after expanding 1.1% in September. That's the weakest growth since output collapsed in April during the first lockdown. Some glimmers of hope arrived this week with a limited rollout of a COVID vaccine. And potential for a rebound in consumer spending in 2021.  But many businesses will face new headwinds from trade restrictions with the European Union that come into force on January 1st. Britain and the EU have given themselves until Sunday to seal a new trade pact that would limit some of the damage. One economist told Reuters that the economy is in for a difficult few months. Britain has Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19. It also suffered the biggest economic hit of any major economy after GDP shrank by an unprecedented 19.8% in the second quarter of this year. And government forecasters do not expect the economy to regain its pre-COVID size until the end of 2022.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '54a38333e8591b4e65733039526e7e45', 'title': 'The Unnecessary Stimulus', 'description': 'In January, President Biden presented his $1.9 trillion spending package as an emergency measure to address a continuing public-health crisis. Now, as the bill heads to a vote in the House, more than 65 million Americans have been vaccinated, with new cases of COVID-19 on a steady decline. In the meantime, consumer spending and business investment have jumped while jobless claims have decreased. For a party ostensibly committed to “following the science,” the Democrats are surprisingly willing to ignore the data and act as if it is still March of 2020. Yet even if the economic outlook were as negative as the Democrats claim, Biden’s proposal would do little to improve it. More than one third of the so-called stimulus won’t be spent until 2022 or later. Public-education grants are expected to last until 2028, even as teachers’ unions refuse to reopen schools. That’s partially because $113 billion in education aid from the last relief bill remains unspent. So too with $370 billion in state and local assistance, the lion’s share of which would sit unused until 2023. With some exceptions, state and local budgets are in good shape. The Committee for a Responsible Budget finds that state and local tax receipts grew by 10 percent in 2020. What the Democrats position as emergency relief is in fact a bailout of profligate public-pension plans and mismanaged blue states. The money that will be spent this year — on checks to households and unemployment top-ups — is wasteful at best and contractionary at worst. Thanks to last year’s CARES Act, personal incomes are higher now than they were before the pandemic. Most Americans used the first round of checks to pad out their savings accounts and pay down debt. The second round, delivered in December, contributed to the highest bump in retail spending since 2009. A deficit-funded subsidy to consumers might be a boon to economic growth if Americans went back to work, but the Biden administration is committed to making unemployment as attractive as possible. The proposed $400 unemployment top-ups, extended until September, would leave 60 percent of benefit recipients making more off-the-job than on-the-job. Not to mention Biden’s proposed federal minimum wage of $15, which would kill 1.4 million jobs according to the Congressional Budget Office. Recent shortages of everything from lumber to computer chips show that supply remains a bigger issue than demand. No amount of consumer spending can stimulate an economy in which businesses are unable to produce goods and services. Not only does the Biden bill ignore these issues, but it exacerbates them by incentivizing the unemployed to stay home. Elsewhere, the bill’s expanded Obamacare subsidies — a backdoor attempt to improve some of the many disappointing results of Obamacare — would raise prices for most Americans and increase the already astronomical sums of money spent on health care in the U.S. As with most of Biden’s proposal, it does not belong in an emergency-relief bill. The pandemic is not yet over, and the economy remains fragile. Legislation that accelerated vaccinations and positioned businesses to reopen as quickly as possible would be welcome. The Biden stimulus is not that.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '21dccf61bce037f248a04c51b6990c5d', 'title': 'Mike Pence Backs Away From the Trump Election ‘Fraud’ Train Wreck', 'description': "Vice President Mike Pence has been a go-to fundraising draw for the president’s campaign, and since October, no more than a day passed without his name emblazoning a fundraising email for the Trump reelect.But that changed late last month. Since Nov. 25, not a single fundraising email from the Trump campaign or its Republican National Committee fundraising account has featured Pence’s name in the “from” field. And this week, that Republican National Committee joint fundraising committee, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, made another subtle change: a handful of its emails swapped out the official Trump-Pence campaign logo for one featuring just the president’s name.At first blush, those may seem like minor tweaks to gimmicky portions of Team Trump’s fundraising strategy. A source familiar with the process said the fundraising emails do not go to Vice President Pence's team for clearance and an RNC official said the digital team was merely testing a new logo around the end of the month deadline. Indeed, some of the joint fundraising committee’s emails this week have included the original campaign logo with Pence’s name below Trump’s.But several high-level sources say that the graphics change, along with Pence’s disappearance from the headers of President Donald Trump’s increasingly frantic and conspiratorial pleas, are not actually coincidental. According to four people with knowledge of the matter, they reflect an effort by the vice president and his team to distance Pence from some of the president’s more outlandish claims about a conspiracy to undermine the election and illegally deny him a second term in office.“It is an open secret [in Trumpworld] that Vice President Pence absolutely does not feel the same way about the legal effort as President Trump does,” said a senior administration official. “The vice president doesn’t want to go down with this ship…and believes much of the legal work has been unhelpful.”The Trump campaign declined to comment on this story. Devin O’Malley, a spokesman for Pence, said Wednesday night, “As he has for the last four years, the Vice President is proud to stand with the president—in this case to ensure every legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is rejected. The Daily Beast’s anonymous sources have no real insight into what the Vice President thinks on these matters.”Trump Campaign Has Raised $150M Off Voter-Fraud Fiction Since ElectionThe political marriage between Trump and Pence was always based on simple tradeoff: Pence gave Trump credibility among establishment and religious types and, in exchange, shared the spoils of Trump’s far larger and more unorthodox coalition of voters. But in the aftermath of the 2020 elections, that deal has come under intense strain.As Trump has tended to his own future, Pence has preferred to place his energies on the critical Senate run-offs in Georgia. Pence, sources say, privately views the Rudy Giuliani-led legal operation to overturn the 2020 election through the mass disenfranchisement of votes as counterproductive and doomed. And, as a former governor himself, he has been particularly uncomfortable with Trump’s attacks on Republican governors in some of the key battleground states that he lost. The president has accused several GOP leaders of incompetence or negligence in their inability or unwillingness to stop the certification of their state’s election results.“Pence deeply understands the position that [Ohio Gov. Mike] DeWine, [Arizona Gov. Dave] Ducey and [Georgia Gov. Brian] Kemp are in. He has tried to be an effective mediator and communicator between those parties and the president back and forth,” said one Pence ally. “Any time he’s played that role, it’s gone well. The president is satisfied with the facts they’ve provided. And then somehow, without hours or days, the president is publicly attacking them by being fed inaccurate information from other White House sources, which frustrates the VP. It’s not a good look for the president. And it’s only created division in the party at a time when unity is very important.”The result has been a subtle but clear effort at creating political space.Rudy’s Phony Fraud Hearing in Gettysburg Debuts Trump’s Shadow GovernmentSince Election Day, Pence has walked a rhetorical tightrope as he tries to publicly back Trump’s position in general terms while avoiding the more outlandish allegations that the president frequently floats on Twitter and in his few post-election public remarks. Pence has repeatedly demanded that “every legal vote” be counted and that alleged voter fraud be rooted out.But he has studiously avoided backing Trump’s more conspiratorial allegations about election malfeasance, and declined to answer questions about his views on specific Trump statements. For example, a pool report from a November 20 rally in Georgia, where Pence campaigned on behalf of Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, noted that the vice president “did not echo the president’s rhetoric on the election being ‘rigged.’The disconnect is also evident on Pence’s Twitter feed. While the president has fervently tweeted about the supposed conspiracy against him, Pence’s tweets on the matter have been far fewer and more muted. He’s devoted far more social media space to the White House’s efforts to get a coronavirus vaccine out the door and to last month’s NASA rocket launch, which sent U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.Since November 15, Pence has tweeted just three times about supposed election irregularities. Two of those tweets were links to news stories, shared without comment, about recount and vote audit efforts in Georgia, and one simply retweeted a reporter’s quotation of Pence’s comments at that November 20 rally, where Pence declared that Trump would “keep fighting until every legal vote is counted” and “every illegal vote is thrown out.”Pence made other similarly anodyne comments in his remarks that tiptoed around the president’s allegations of widespread voter fraud. But he also repeatedly called on Georgia Republicans to “defend the majority” in the U.S. Senate—a tacit acknowledgement that, if Democrats win both Georgia Senate seats, a Vice President Kamala Harris would break the upper chamber’s 50-50 split and give her party a majority.That unspoken premise is a reality that Republican operatives and the party’s top donors have acknowledged even as the president remains obstinate.“I have not seen any evidence yet that would convince me that [the Trump legal team] will be successful in getting this to the Supreme Court or even anything to an appeals court,” Ed Rollins, a veteran GOP strategist who chairs the pro-Trump group Great America PAC, said on Wednesday. “I’m disappointed in the effort, as someone who has been around the game for a long time. I’ve seen a lot of ranting and raving from them, but not any really good legal challenges. Neither Rudy nor Sidney [Powell] nor anybody else on the team is considered a first-rate election lawyer and I don’t see any on this team.”On Wednesday, Pence went to Capitol Hill where he participated in the swearing in of Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ)—an act that implicitly conceded the validity of the elections in Arizona. Hours later, Trump put out a 46 minute long speech in which he called for the results in six battleground states, including Arizona, to be overturned and for him to remain president. Pence was not by his side.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!Daily Beast Membership: Beast Inside goes deeper on the stories that matter to you.

But there are some people who should not get the Moderna vaccine, according to the official fact sheet. Read on to discover the few who may be in danger, and be relieved that it works well for the majority of its users—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus. 1 What Should You Mention to Your Vaccination Provider Before You Get the Moderna Vaccine? “Tell your vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have any allergies have a fever have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system are pregnant or plan to become pregnant are breastfeeding have received another COVID-19 vaccine” 2 Who Should Get the Moderna Vaccine? “FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in individuals 18 years of age and older.” 3 Who Should Not Get the Moderna Vaccine? “You should not get the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine if you: had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine” 4 So What’s in the Moderna Vaccine? “The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following ingredients: messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate, and sucrose.” 5 How is the Moderna Vaccine Given? “The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine will be given to you as an injection into the muscle. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination series is 2 doses given 1 month apart. If you receive one dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, you should receive a second dose of the same vaccine 1 month later to complete the vaccination series.” 6 What are the Benefits of the Moderna Vaccine? “In an ongoing clinical trial, the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine has been shown to prevent COVID-19 following 2 doses given 1 month apart. The duration of protection against COVID-19 is currently unknown.”RELATED: Doctor Warns “Do Not” Do This Before Your Vaccine 7 What are the Risks of the Moderna Vaccine? “Side effects that have been reported with the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine include: Injection site reactions: pain, tenderness and swelling of the lymph nodes in the same arm of the injection, swelling (hardness), and redness General side effects: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, and feverThere is a remote chance that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: Difficulty breathing Swelling of your face and throat A fast heartbeat A bad rash all over your body Dizziness and weakness These may not be all the possible side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is still being studied in clinical trials.” 8 So is the Moderna Vaccine Safe? Yes, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says the Moderna vaccine is “safe and effective” and that you should choose whichever vaccine is available to you. (If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1, or go to the nearest hospital. Call the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away.) So get vaccinated when it becomes available to you (unless you are allergic), and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

Democrats are looking to include the first hike to the federal minimum wage since 2009 in President Biden\'s coronavirus relief bill. They plan to revise the proposal Tuesday, but it so far includes a quick increase from the current minimum wage of $7.25 to $9.50 within the year. It will then grow annually until hitting $15 in 2021. Meanwhile the tipped minimum wage of $2.50 will rise to $4.95 this year, and again increase until it matches the federal wage. The youth subminimum wage paid to people under 20 will also end up matching the regular minimum wage by 2027, and permits to pay subminimum wage will no longer be distributed. Here\'s the details on the federal min wage increase Democrats are going to try to include in their covid relief bill: Raised to $9.50 w/in 3 months; $15 by 2025, indexed thereafter. Tipped wage disappears by 2027.Via House @EdLaborCmte, which is marking up tomorrow: pic.twitter.com/aNMnTdgJf0 — Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) February 8, 2021 A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released Monday found that raising the minimum wage to $15/hour by 2024 would increase paychecks for 17 million Americans, or 10 percent of the workforce. It would also lift 900,000 people out of poverty, but cost 1.4 million jobs, particularly for "younger, less educated people." Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a top proponent of the $15 minimum wage, quickly disputed some of the report\'s findings. The CBO has demonstrated that increasing the minimum wage would have a direct and substantial impact on the federal budget. What that means is that we can clearly raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour under the rules of budget reconciliation. pic.twitter.com/YyTEYkOugX — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 8, 2021 More stories from theweek.comWhat\'s the point of Trump\'s second impeachment trial?5 brutally funny cartoons about America\'s bungled vaccine rolloutTrump\'s impeachment lawyers argue he only wanted supporters to \'fight\' in \'the figurative sense\'', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The head of the World Health Organization called recent increases in deaths and cases “truly worrying trends.”AstraZeneca Plc said it will release up-to-date results from the final stage trial of its vaccine within 48 hours, responding to criticism from a U.S. science agency. The European Union and Britain edged toward breaking their deadlock over the drugmaker’s shots, while Germany will impose a hard lockdown over Easter to try to reverse a wave of infections.Progress in fighting the crisis is showing signs of stalling. While fatalities in the U.S. and U.K. ease, places like India and eastern Europe are seeing a resurgence.

The drug binds to an enzyme called a protease to keep the virus from replicating. Protease-inhibiting medicines have been successful in treating other types of viruses, include HIV and Hepatitis C.The new protease inhibitor is the second such medicine Pfizer has brought into human trials to treat Covid-19. Pfizer is testing another given intravenously to hospitalized virus patients.NYC Municipal Workers Will Return May 3 (10:30 a.m. NY)New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said about 80,000 city workers will return to their offices beginning May 3, a promise he outlined in his State of the City address in January.“We’re going to have strict safety measures in place,” de Blasio said Tuesday during a virus briefing. “It’s another step toward the full recovery of New York City.”The city has administered more than 3.4 million vaccines and is expecting a “major boost” in supply in early April, the mayor said. All New Yorkers 50 and older are eligible to get their Covid-19 shots.Portugal Reaffirms Vaccine Goal (9:44 a.m. NY)Portuguese Health Minister Marta Temido reaffirmed that the country will meet a goal to administer a vaccine dose to at least 80% of people over 80 by the end of March. “Naturally, if we had access to more vaccines we would have the possibility of vaccinating more people,” Temido told reporters.WHO’s Tedros Sees ‘Truly Worrying Trends’ (9:18 a.m. NY)World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the recent rise in Covid-19 deaths and cases are “truly worrying trends.”Speaking at a World Trade Organization virtual event, Tedros urged nations to waive intellectual property rights for vaccines as a “mid- to long-term solution” to help developing countries manufacture their own shots.Fauci: Astra Likely Has a Very Good Vaccine (8:47 a.m. NY)“The fact is this is very likely a very good vaccine,” Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. expert on infectious diseases, said of the Astra shot in a Good Morning America interview.Astra earlier said it will release up-to-date results from the final stage trial of the shot within 48 hours, responding to criticism from a U.S. science agency that the drugmaker’s analysis included old information.India Speeds Vaccine Push Amid Second Wave (8:40 a.m. NY)India’s government opened one of the biggest coronavirus immunization campaigns to everyone over the age of 45 as the nation grapples with a case resurgence amid tensions over delayed vaccine supplies to other countries.World Is Too Optimistic About Covid: Farrar (8:28 a.m. NY)“This pandemic is nowhere near its end,” Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of Wellcome, the U.K. research foundation, said at a conference of the ACT Accelerator, a program to distribute vaccines and diagnostics to low-income countries. “There remains in my view too much optimism that there will be a single magic bullet that solves it all.”After one year, the world remains closer to the start of the pandemic than to its conclusion, as new waves take place around the world, Farrar said.“The end to this pandemic is through science and through the equitable access to that science,” he said. “Without diagnostics, we are blind to what is happening. We do not know how the epidemic is developing and where there are pockets that remain.”In a separate presentation, Fauci sounded a more positive tone. He said people should remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook, even as U.S. cases plateau following recent declines.“I don’t think that that should cause us to despair,” Fauci said in an online talk while being welcomed as an honorary fellow by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. “As we continue to vaccinate more and more people, which will ultimately give us control of the outbreak, we’ve got to remember we can’t just completely turn off all public health measures.”Countries Loosen Visitor Rules (8:20 a.m. NY)Cyprus will open its borders starting April 1 to visitors from Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K., the country’s tourism ministry said. Those with a negative test result who haven’t come into close contact with a confirmed case will be guaranteed a quarantine-free stay. Vaccinated travelers from Israel won’t need to be tested, and the same will apply to Britain starting May 1.Kuwait said arrivals who have taken one of the vaccines it has approved would be exempt from hotel quarantine requirements.Insurer Lures Vaccine Skeptics With Gift Cards (7 a.m. NY)In the effort to encourage skeptics to get vaccinated, one insurer hopes gift cards and cheaper hotel stays may help tip the balance.Manulife Financial Corp. is adding the vaccination as a way to win points in its Vitality health-tracking program, which rewards health- and life-insurance policyholders for things such as exercising, getting health screenings or taking nutrition classes online. Those points can be redeemed for rewards including Amazon.com Inc. gift cards, Hotels.com lodging discounts and less-expensive gym memberships.Citi CEO Bans Zoom on Friday, Urges Vacations (6 a.m. NY)Citigroup Inc.

Economists expected the rate to rise to 5.2%.Regeneron Cocktail Cuts Hospitalizations 70% (2:53 p.m. HK)Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it would apply for U.S. authorization for a lower dose of its Covid-19 antibody cocktail, after data from a final-stage trial showed early use of the drug reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 70%.Malaysia, Singapore Vaccine Certification (2:46 p.m. HK)Malaysia and Singapore are working toward reciprocal vaccination certification as the Southeast Asian neighbors plan to restore cross-border travel. Operational details, including the application process involved for entry and exit between the two nations will be discussed further.Covid Patients Should Postpone Surgery: Study (2:15 p.m. HK)Surgery should be delayed seven weeks for people who test positive for Covid-19 to reduce the risk of dying, according to the COVIDSurg Collaborative, an international group of 15,000 surgeons reviewing the likelihood of complications from elective surgery in coronavirus cases. Using data from 140,727 patients in 1,674 hospitals across 116 countries, the group found patients are more than 2.5 times more likely to die after surgery if the operation was performed within six weeks of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.Germany’s Easter Lockdown (9:55 a.m. HK)Chancellor Merkel and regional leaders agreed to put Germany into hard lockdown over Easter to try to reverse a “third wave” of infections fueled by faster-spreading mutations.Under the plan, stores will be shuttered from April 1 for five days, except for food stores which will open on April 3, Merkel said after a video call with the country’s 16 state premiers that lasted more than 11 hours. Citizens will be encouraged to remain at home, and private gatherings limited to one other household and a maximum of five people.“We are now in a very, very serious situation,” Merkel said at a news conference that started just after 2:30 a.m. in Berlin. “The case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive-care beds are filling up again,” she said, adding that the number of infections must come down to allow the country’s vaccination campaign to start taking effect.Separately, Merkel said the EU shouldn’t impose a general vaccine export ban. “We must be very careful with general export bans at this stage,” she said. “Instead we will have to look very closely at supply chains.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Walter Jones, a spokesman for the office, confirmed with ABC News that the investigation has begun, and said the inquiry will be "fact-finding and administrative in nature." The probe was triggered on Monday after George Washington University Law Prof. John Banzhaf filed a formal complaint, saying Trump may have violated three Georgia state laws: conspiracy to commit election fraud, criminal solicitation to commit election fraud, and intentional interference with performance of election duties. Trump lost Georgia to President Biden, and made calls to Raffensperger and the secretary of state\'s chief investigator in his quest to overturn the results. In a recording made on Jan. 2 and obtained by ABC News, Trump is heard asking Raffensperger to "find" 11,780 votes — the number he would need to win the state. Once the probe is finished, the State Election Board will decide whether a criminal referral should be sent to the state attorney general or Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who has said the call between Trump and Raffensperger was "deeply disturbing." She also stated that "anyone who commits a felony violation of Georgia law in my jurisdiction will be held accountable." People close to Willis told ABC News even if the case is not referred to her, she might still pursue her own investigation.

Three months later the country has lost almost 100,000 more lives Coronavirus patients in a field hospital set up inside a sports coliseum in Santo André, on the outskirt of São Paulo, Brazil, on 4 March. Photograph: André Penner/AP It was midway through February when André Machado realized Brazil’s coronavirus catastrophe was racing into a bewildering and remorseless new phase. “The floodgates opened and the water came gushing out,” recalled the infectious disease specialist from the Our Lady of the Conception hospital in Porto Alegre, one of the largest cities in southern Brazil. Since then, Machado’s hospital, like health centres up and down the country, has been engulfed by a deluge of jittery, gasping patients – many of them previously healthy and bafflingly young. Among the recent admissions was a heavily pregnant 37-year-old who was brought in complaining of breathing difficulties and a cough. Doctors performed an emergency C-section to deliver the baby in a desperate bid to take the pressure off the expectant mother’s Covid-racked lungs. “We’re trying to help people but this disease is much faster and more aggressive than the tactics we’ve been using,” Machado, 44, said of his team’s efforts to keep pace with a tripling of admissions. “It’s like we’re flogging a dead horse,” he said, before adding: “This disease is going to kill many more people in Brazil.” At the end of last year Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro – a Donald Trump-worshiping populist who has gleefully sabotaged Covid containment efforts – declared his country had reached “the tail end” of what was already one of the world’s worst outbreaks. Bolsonaro was wrong. Three months later Latin America’s largest nation has lost almost 100,000 more lives – taking its total death toll to more than 275,000, second only to the US – and been plunged into the deadliest chapter of its 13-month epidemic. Jair Bolsonaro speaks to the media in Brasília, Brazil, on 10 March. Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters This week, as a record 2,349 daily deaths were reported, the former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva castigated Bolsonaro’s “moronic” handling of the crisis and urged citizens to confront their incompetent “blowhard” leader. “This country is in a state of utter tumult and confusion because there’s no government. I’ll repeat that: this country has no government,” Lula declared, blaming Bolsonaro’s “uncivilised” leadership and rejection of science for the scale of Brazil’s disaster. “So, so many lives could have been saved,” Lula claimed, warning: “Covid is taking over the country.” As the emergency intensified this week, frontline health workers from Porto Alegre to Recife, a coastal city 3,000km further north, described scenes of heartbreak, despair and exhaustion as intensive care units and cemeteries fill up like never before.

Photograph: Raphael Alves/EPA “It feels like we’re putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” said Eduarda Santa Rosa Barata, a 31-year-old infectologist who works in three ICUs in the north-eastern capital of Pernambuco state, all now stretched to the limit. “We’re engaged in damage reduction … You open new beds and they fill up immediately.” A few days earlier, Barata had admitted a 37-year-old man who had no underlying medical conditions but whose lungs were so badly damaged he needed intubation. “It seems so random,” she said. “It’s a bizarre disease. It’s frightening.” Machado saw several explanations for the torrent of cases he and other doctors are now seeing, including political mismanagement and the slackening of social distancing measures, principally among the young. In recent months such containment efforts have largely collapsed, with schools and businesses reopening and Bolsonaro’s tourism minister even urging citizens to start holidaying again. But the doctor suspected a third, more troubling element was also at work: an enigmatic and apparently more contagious variant called P1 that is thought to have emerged in the Amazon region in late 2020 but is now circulating across Brazil, including in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, where Machado works. People walk in a shopping center in São Paulo, Brazil, on 4 March. Photograph: Cris Faga/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock “This isn’t just theoretical. It’s something we’re seeing in practice,” Machado said of the variant, at least 10 cases of which have been detected in the UK and 15 in the US. “Before the end of 2020, you’d get a family and one member would be infected but not the other three or four members, even though they lived in the same environment. You don’t see this any more. If there’s one confirmed case, everyone ends up getting infected by the virus,” he said. “It’s obvious that this new variant is now circulating among us.” Just how much of Brazil’s current crisis is down to the new variant, or other variants traced to the UK and South Africa, is a matter of intense debate. Some experts believe the variant has provided a convenient smokescreen for political leaders who have failed to rein in a disease President Bolsonaro has dismissed as a “little flu”. As he ordered a two-week emergency shutdown in Brazil’s most populous state on Thursday, the São Paulo governor, João Doria, claimed the variant played a key role in pushing hospitals to the brink. “This new strain of the virus is very aggressive and very dangerous,” Doria warned, claiming Brazil was “collapsing” under the weight of the surge in cases. Jesem Orellana, an epidemiologist from the Amazon city of Manaus, where hospitals recently ran out of oxygen as a result of the explosion of infections, was unconvinced mutations were the main culprit. “From a political point of view, it’s much easier to place the blame on the variant. But we all know that the worst variant of all is the way the epidemic has been mishandled,” he said. Orellana suspected that having failed to halt coronavirus with unpopular and economically painful lockdowns, politicians at all levels of government were now “using the variant as a crutch to prop themselves up and to justify their mistakes and their negligence over the epidemic”.

Photograph: Diego Vara/Reuters But Marcos Boulos, a leading infectious disease specialist, said he had no doubt the P1 variant was contributing to Brazil’s soaring caseload: “There’s no way of hiding this.” Boulos also said anecdotal evidence from hospitals around Brazil suggested the variant was also producing more serious cases in young people. “We don’t yet have the data to categorically affirm this but it’s possible, from what doctors are seeing,” said the University of São Paulo professor. “Here in the hospital we’ve got a 20-year-old woman in our ICU in serious condition. Today you have serious patients in ICU from all age groups. Before we’d say it was almost 90% elderly. Today they’re still the majority, but not in same way,” Boulos added. “We don’t yet know how this works, but it’s what we are seeing … There’s no other reason why young people would suddenly start suffering from a more serious disease.” São Paulo’s health secretary, Jean Gorinchteyn, this week told reporters that in many of that state’s ICUs half of patients were now under 50. “I’m talking about 26 and 29 and 30-year-olds – often in a very grave condition,” he said, urging citizens to avoid crowds and remain at home. “We all need to understand that what is happening right now is a different pandemic from the one we saw last year,” Gorinchteyn claimed. Barata said she also had the impression that her Covid patients were getting younger, and reaching hospital in a worse condition. Despite having been immunised with the Chinese-produced CoronaVac vaccine in February, she admitted feeling more fearful now than during the previous peak last June. “It feels like every day the virus draws nearer … Everywhere you look around you, you can say there’s someone who has symptoms, or who is sick, or in hospital … The mother-in-law of one of my colleagues is in critical condition in intensive care,” she said. Barata said she was uncertain what, if any, role new variants were playing in Brazil’s latest misfortune, but whatever – or whoever – was responsible, she feared the human tragedy was far from over: “It feels like the disease is laying siege to us, closing in and infecting everyone who hasn’t yet caught it.” Machado said that after the delivery of her 36-week-old baby, the expectant mother and her child were rushed to intensive care, where the former was put on a ventilator. “We don’t know if she’ll make it,” he admitted last week as the hospital’s Covid-19 wards reached the brink of collapse and fears grew over the global impact of Brazil’s unchecked epidemic. Twenty-four hours later, at 10 minutes past midnight, the woman was gone, leaving five orphaned children and a country in disarray.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The results will heap pressure on Mrs Merkel ahead of September’s general election, when Germans will finally choose her successor as chancellor. According to initial projections, her Christian Democrat (CDU) party slumped to its worst ever results in two states it once regarded as strongholds. In the key southern state of Baden-Württemberg, where the party ruled uninterrupted for 58 years, it limped in with just 23 per cent of the vote, far behind the rival Greens who won the state with 31 per cent. In Rhineland-Palatinate, it saw its vote share fall by more than 6 points to just 26 per cent, as the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) won the state with 34.5 per cent. Experts cautioned that the unusually high share of postal votes because of the coronavirus meant initial projections might not be as accurate as usual. But it was clear the CDU had suffered a terrible evening, as its two main rivals in September divided the spoils. Lars Klingbeil, the SPD secretary-general told German television the results had blown the race to succeed Mrs Merkel as chancellor in September wide open, . “There are majorities in reach for coalitions without the CDU,” Mr Klingbeil said. “The message to the federal government is: the race is open.” These were the first significant elections in Germany since the pandemic began, and the CDU’s heavy losses were widely seen as a verdict on the country's shambolic vaccine roll-out. Just a couple of months ago, the CDU was ahead in Rhineland-Palatinate and neck-and-neck with the Greens in Baden-Württemberg, but it saw its vote evaporate in both states as it became clear that Germany, the world’s fourth-biggest economy, is months behind the UK and US in vaccinating its citizens. A corruption scandal that saw three MPs forced to resign in a week — two of them over alleged kickbacks for government facemask contracts — in the run-up to voting did not help. Mrs Merkel, who was praised for much of last year for her initial handling of the crisis, is now reaping the voters' anger over her fateful decision to entrust vaccine orders to the European Commission. Just 6 per cent of Germans have received their first jab so far, compared to more than 30 per cent of Britons. After almost four months in lockdown, Germany is weary of restrictions and there is no end in sight. The CDU is now close to crisis. There must be serious doubt over whether Armin Laschet, who was elected party leader less than two months ago, can now be trusted to be its candidate for chancellor in September. Jens Spahn, until recently another contender for the role, is facing calls to resign as health minister. That leaves Markus Söder, the popular leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, who may now be parachuted in as a rescue candidate. The far-Right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), for so long the thorn in Mrs Merkel’s side, failed to capitalise on public anger and saw its vote share fall in both states. But the CDU’s two main rivals, the Greens and the SPD, will both now believe they have a chance to oust the party from power in September and lead a rival coalition. The SPD, currently Mrs Merkel’s junior coalition partner, have managed to distance themselves from the vaccine chaos and their chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz, has had a good pandemic as finance minister. The Greens, currently second in the national polls, will believe their resounding victory in Baden-Württemberg could be the springboard for the party to seize the chancellery and lead a national government for the first time. Mrs Merkel, who has spent so much of her final two years in fighting to secure the CDU leadership for her ideological heirs, could now find the next chancellor isn't even from her party.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'a2762281572c25a1154cd444a770621b', 'title': "Is 'Natural Immunity' From COVID Better Than a Vaccine?", 'description': 'On the heels of last month\'s news of stunning results from Pfizer\'s and Moderna\'s experimental COVID-19 vaccines, Sen. Rand Paul tweeted a provocative comparison.The new vaccines were 90% and 94.5% effective, Paul said. But "naturally acquired" COVID-19 was even better, at 99.9982%, he claimed.Paul, R-Ky., is one of many people who, weary of lockdowns and economic losses, have extolled the benefits of contracting the coronavirus. The senator was diagnosed with the disease this year and has argued that surviving a bout of COVID-19 confers greater protection, and poses fewer risks, than getting vaccinated.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe trouble with that logic is that it\'s difficult to predict who will survive an infection unscathed, said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto. Given all of the unknowns -- like a region\'s hospital capacity, or the strength of a person\'s immune response -- choosing the disease over the vaccine is "a very bad decision," she said.The primary advantage of a vaccine is that it\'s predictable and safe, she said. "It\'s been optimally tailored to generate an effective immune response."But what do we know about how the immunity from a prior infection compares with the protection given by the new vaccines? And what if you have already had COVID -- is it safe to be vaccinated? We asked experts to weigh in on the latest evidence.Which produces a stronger immune response: a natural infection or a vaccine?The short answer: We don\'t know. But COVID-19 vaccines have predictably prevented illness, and they are a far safer bet, experts said.Vaccines for some pathogens, like pneumococcal bacteria, induce better immunity than the natural infection does. Early evidence suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines may fall into this category. Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies -- one marker of immune response -- in their blood than did people who had been sick with COVID-19.In other cases, however, a natural infection is more powerful than a vaccine. For example, having mumps -- which can cause sterility in men -- generates lifelong immunity, but some people who have received one or two doses of the vaccine still get the disease.To Paul\'s point: Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong. A vast majority of people infected produce at least some antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection. And the evidence so far suggests that this protection will persist for years, preventing serious illness, if not reinfection.But there is a "massive dynamic range" in that immune response, with a 200-fold difference in antibody levels.In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months. "Those people might benefit more from the vaccine than others would," said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.The diversity in the immune response from natural infection might be because of differences in the amount of virus to which the person was exposed.With a vaccine, everyone gets the same dose. "We know the dose that is being administered, and we know that that dose is effective at eliciting an immune response," Gommerman said. "So that becomes a variable that\'s taken off the table when you get the vaccine."I\'m young, healthy and at low risk of COVID. Why not take my chances with that rather than get a rushed vaccine?The experts were unanimous in their answer: COVID-19 is by far the more dangerous option."It\'s clear that one is less problematic for the body to recover from them than the other -- there\'s more risk with natural infection," said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.People who are obese, or who have diseases like diabetes are particularly susceptible to severe cases of COVID-19. On average, the virus seems to be less risky for younger people, and women tend to fare better than men. But beyond those broad generalizations, doctors don\'t know why some people get very sick and die while others have no symptoms.For example, people who harbor certain mutations in immune genes are more susceptible to the disease, several studies have shown. "So there\'s a risk factor that has nothing to do with age," Gommerman said.In a study of more than 3,000 people, ages 18 to 34, who were hospitalized for COVID, 20% required intensive care and 3% died."It\'s true that most people aren\'t going to be hospitalized, most people aren\'t going to get in the intensive care unit or die," said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, who represents the American Academy of Pediatrics at the meetings of the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.But "nobody is immune to severe disease," she said. And even if people are not at high risk of COVID themselves, their friends or family could be.As many as one in three people who recover from COVID have chronic complaints, including exhaustion and a racing heart, for months afterward. This includes people under 35 with no previous health conditions. Some survivors of COVID also show troubling signs that their body has turned on itself, with symptoms similar to those of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.COVID vaccines, in contrast, carry little known risk. They have been tested in tens of thousands of people with no serious side effects -- at least so far. "Once you start vaccinating millions, you might find very, very rare events," Hanage said. "But we have to know that they are very, very rare and much more rare than the adverse events associated with natural infection."I had COVID. Is it safe for me to get a vaccine? If so, when could I get one?It\'s safe, and probably even beneficial, for anyone who has had COVID to get the vaccine at some point, experts said."There\'s nothing deleterious about getting a boost to an immune response that you\'ve had before," Pepper said. "You could get an actually even better immune response by boosting whatever immunity you had from the first infection by a vaccine."In fact, at a meeting on Wednesday, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said up to 10% of participants in clinical trials for the vaccines had been infected with the virus without knowing it. Their immune responses to the vaccine are being analyzed, he said.If you\'ve already had COVID-19, you can afford to wait awhile for the vaccine.Studies from Pepper\'s team and others have shown that the immune response evolves over the first few months after infection, but everyone who has had COVID has some level of protection during that time."We didn\'t see anybody who didn\'t develop some sort of an immune response," she said. "I don\'t think those people need to rush out and go get the vaccine in the same way that people who are highly susceptible really do."The ACIP, which makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccine distribution, said at a meeting on Wednesday that people who had not been infected should get priority over those who contracted the virus in the past 90 days."At some point we\'ll need to figure out whether 90 days is the right number," Maldonado said. But for now, "people who have evidence of infection recently should probably not be vaccinated at first in line because there\'s so little vaccine available."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

But maybe not all scandals are created equal. "Over the weekend, Biden took a short break from his day-to-day presidenting to catch the Super Bowl from his home in Delaware — and if you aren\'t immediately outraged about that, well, you obviously haven\'t been watching the last 48 hours of conservative news media," Noah said. "But it\'s not surprising that Biden bent the travel rules for himself, because he\'s been president for less that three weeks and already he\'s had more scandals than we can keep track of — although, my friends, we are going to try in our brand-new segment: \'Joe Biden, The Worst President in History That We Can Remember.\'" Noah covered White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki\'s Space Force brouhaha, Biden\'s comments about honorable FBI agents, Hunter Biden\'s memoir deal, and the three scandals Biden chalked up even before becoming president. "That\'s right, Joe Biden stole 10 minutes of Donald Trump\'s presidency, or as Fox News calls it, Tenghazi," Noah deadpanned. "Who knows what Trump could have accomplished in those 10 minutes? I mean, maybe that\'s when he was finally going to release his health care plan. He could have used that time to walk down half a ramp! And do you have any idea how much Fox News Trump could have watched in that 10 minutes? Like, 10 minutes! So those are they many Joe Biden scandals by the muckraking journalists of conservative media in just his first three weeks in office." He predicted some Biden scandals that could come next. One of those conservative would-be Biden muckrakers lost his platform over the weekend, and The Daily Show also took a moment to say farewell to Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, "the most North Korean broadcaster America has ever seen."

{'_id': '1be0b4e1e4daf64deaa6fb1311b4773d', 'title': 'The CDC Just Made This Major Update to Its Vaccine Guidelines', 'description': 'The COVID vaccine has only been available in the country since December, and the U.S. has already administered more than 17 million doses. Even so, the vaccine rollout has not exactly been a smooth endeavor, with some states already running out of vaccines. These issues may force some recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to change over time. In fact, the CDC just made a major update to their vaccine guidelines concerning the timeline of the second dose. Read on to find out what this change means for you, and for more on the second shot, Dr. Fauci Says He Had These Side Effects From His Second Vaccine Dose. The CDC says you can wait up to six weeks to get your second vaccine dose. People can now wait up to six weeks (or 42 days) after their first dose of the COVID vaccine to get their second dose "if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval," the CDC says. This has changed from their previous guidelines, which said that "there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine." The CDC does still note that second doses should not be given earlier than the timeframe recommended. And for more CDC guidelines you need to know, The CDC Warns Against Using These 6 Face Masks. But the actual recommended time between vaccine doses is shorter than that. The recommended interval of time between doses is still shorter than six weeks for both vaccines, however. According to the CDC, the Pfizer vaccine doses should be given about three weeks apart, or 21 days, and the Moderna vaccine doses should be given about a month apart, or 28 days. Even in its newly updated guidelines, the CDC says that the second dose should be given as close to this recommended time as possible. And for more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter. Dr. Fauci says delaying your second dose would be "taking a chance." Not everyone is totally on board with delaying second doses. Anthony Fauci, MD, chief medical adviser to the White House, told CNN that people would be "taking a chance" if they followed the updated guidance from the CDC."You\'re taking a chance. The data from the clinical trials showed that in the Moderna trial, you should get the boost 28 days after the prime, that\'s what I got, I got it exactly 28 days later—when you\'re dealing with Pfizer it\'s 21, that\'s where the data show is the optimal effect," Fauci told CNN on Jan. 21. He noted that it may be possible the delay is "not going to be a big deal," but it\'s impossible to know for sure because no trials have been conducted on the extended time internal. And for more essential vaccine information, If You Take These OTC Meds, You Have to Stop Before Getting the Vaccine. And the FDA has not supported delaying second doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had also previously advised against delaying second doses. On Jan. 4, the agency issued a statement after health officials had considered adopting plans to delay people\'s second doses to save supplies for others to get theirs first—a move that has been adopted in other countries, like the U.K."At this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence," the agency said in its statement. "Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19."

More than 800,000 people have received their first dose of the vaccine in 11 days, making up over 7.4 per cent of the population. For the past two days, they have passed their target of vaccinating over 150,000 people a day. More than 30 per cent of the over-60s have already been vaccinated and the country is on track to inoculate everyone in that age bracket within the next 10 days if they continue at a pace of above 100,000 a day. But as shortages loom, the health ministry has been forced to announce that they will mostly stop administering first doses between January 10 and January 31 to ensure that there is enough stock to give the second dose to the people who have already received the vaccination. Israel had aimed to open the vaccination to the general public within a week but the delay may now push that back by up to six weeks, according to Channel 12 news. Instead, Hezi Levy, the health ministry’s director-general told Kan news that come February there may be a limited widening of the vaccination drive, perhaps with the age threshold lowered to 50. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had said last week that he aimed to have 2.25 million Israelis out of a population of 9.2 million vaccinated by the end of January. Yuli Edelstein, Israel’s health minister, told Channel 12 news before yesterday's announcement that “even if we were to stop for two weeks” Israel would still be far ahead of any other country in inoculations per capita.

He\'s steered the nation through skyrocketing cases, misinformation, an ambivalent public, and a disjointed national response to COVID\'s containment—all while walking the tightrope of partisan politics.But that doesn\'t mean that Fauci doesn\'t have a few of his own regrets. Yes, he typically focuses on the concrete measures we can all take to stay safe, but every so often the immunologist treats us to a more reflective side.In a recent interview with PIX11 News, host Dan Mannarino asked Fauci to describe his "one regret about the handling of COVID-19," and the doctor was characteristically candid. Read on to learn Fauci\'s answer, plus three more regrets he\'s shared publicly. And for more Fauci news, check out Dr. Fauci Says This Is What\'s "Disturbing"About One New COVID Strain.Read the original article on Best Life. 1 He regrets a lack of coordinated response. Fauci knows that our nation\'s efforts to quell COVID have yielded both successes and failures. In a recent "lightning round" of questioning during his interview with PIX11 News, the host asked Fauci to name his top regret about the handling of COVID-19."That\'s tough…" Fauci replied. "I believe if we had a more coordinated approach, but I\'m not sure that\'s anybody\'s fault," he began. "We\'re living in a very divisive society… and when you\'re in a divisive society, then all of a sudden public health matters become politicized. When they become politicized, you\'ve got a problem."While Fauci was careful not to point fingers at any one political affiliation, he gave this example: "If someone doesn\'t want to wear a mask because they think it\'s a political statement, that\'s a problem." And for more insights from Fauci, check out Dr. Fauci Just Said These 5 Very Scary Words About COVID-19. 2 He also felt he "should\'ve been more vocal" about testing. Though Fauci had endorsed mass testing early in his COVID response, he acknowledged that he could have tried harder to ensure his message was heard. "Deep down, perhaps I should\'ve been much more vocal about saying, we really absolutely gotta do that," Fauci said in a November interview with STAT\'s senior infectious diseases reporter, Helen Branswell. "I said it, it went nowhere, and maybe I should have kept pushing the envelope on that.""Community spread doesn\'t stop spontaneously unless you do something about it," Fauci added. "It is easier to stop when the level is relatively low. The only way that you can get at community spread is that you need to test people who are without symptoms," he explained. 3 He regretted casting doubt on the U.K.\'s quick approval of vaccines. When the U.K. was the first to approve Pfizer\'s COVID vaccine, Fauci suggested to the public that they had done so in haste. "The FDA in the United States, I think, everyone realizes globally is the gold standard of regulatory function," he said at the time.Fauci later acknowledged that he misspoke, saying, "There really has been a misunderstanding and for that I\'m sorry… I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community at the U.K.," he told the BBC.He continued his mea culpa by acknowledging his insult. "Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that\'s just the reality," he added. "I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way." And for more vaccine news, check out The FDA Just Ruled You Can\'t Do These 4 Things With the COVID Vaccines. 4 He acknowledged that early messaging about masks was flawed. Perhaps more a reflection than a regret, Fauci has offered some thoughts on his flawed early messaging on masks.According to a timeline published by Forbes, when the virus first reached the U.S. in Mar. 2020, Fauci told the public, "there\'s no reason to be walking around with a mask." He suggested that masks should be reserved for frontline healthcare workers and could cause "unintended consequences" if people touched their faces while adjusting them. By the end of that month, Fauci announced that he was engaged in "very active discussion" about whether to reverse that guidance. Not long after, in an Apr. 3, 2020 interview, he urged viewers to "wear some sort of facial covering" when out in public.Later, in a Jul. 2020 interview with The Washington Post, he explained the reversal. "What happened as the weeks and months came by, two things became clear: one, that there wasn\'t a shortage of masks, we had plenty of masks and coverings that you could put on that\'s plain cloth…so that took care of that problem. Secondly, we fully realized that there are a lot of people who are asymptomatic who are spreading infection. So it became clear that we absolutely should be wearing masks consistently," he said.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

That\'s what the U.K. has done, and some experts have called for a similar approach in the U.S.Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for freeSeparately, Pfizer and BioNtech\'s announcement that vaccine vials can be stored and transported at -25°C to-15°C (-13°F to 5°F) could allow the vaccine to be handled by ordinary pharmacies that aren\'t equipped with ultra-low freezers, which have been an impediment in the vaccine rollout.The companies said that they had submitted a proposed update to the FDA\'s emergency use authorization to allow the vaccine to be stored at these temperatures "as an alternative or complement to storage in an ultra-low temperature freezer."Details: Pfizer\'s clinical trials initially showed that its vaccine prevented roughly 52% of infections after one dose, rising to 95% after two doses.The new research published in The Lancet, however, found that the first shot of Pfizer\'s vaccine actually prevented about 75% of infections, and 85% of symptomatic infections, up to 28 days after it was administered.The findings were based on an evaluation of about 9,000 people in Israel, which has vaccinated over two-thirds of its adult population, The Wall Street Journal reports.Yes, but: There are some limitations to this study and its implications for delaying second doses.Although the first dose appeared to be more powerful than originally anticipated, researchers still don\'t know how long its effects will last.Pfizer recommends getting the second dose 21 days after the first one. The Israeli study measured the efficacy of the first shot within 15 to 28 days of its administration — not a significant delay. And most participants in the trial did receive their second shots, the authors told the WSJ. The big picture: Most of the people in this study got their second doses, and got those doses on time. Second doses were not delayed in this case, and so this study does not directly answer the question of what happens when you delay second doses.The findings will bolster calls to delay second doses because they indicate that first doses are more effective than we realized — making a compelling case to get that level of protection to as many people as possible as quickly as possible, to save lives and bring the pandemic under control.Like this article?

But their effectiveness, manufacturing and distribution vary.Why it matters: Any of the authorized vaccines are much better than no vaccine, especially for people at high risk of severe coronavirus infections. But their differences may fuel perceptions of inequity, and raise legitimate questions about the best way to use each one. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for freeThe big picture: Under the threat of new variants, vaccinating as many people as fast as possible is key to controlling the outbreak in the U.S. Public health experts are generally united in saying that Americans should get whichever vaccine they are offered first.All three vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. — from Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson — registered a very high efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19.“The efficacy against severe disease [is] greater than 85%, and there have been no hospitalization or deaths in multiple countries, even in countries that have the variants,” NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said of the Johnson & Johnson shot this weekend on ABC’s “This Week.” “Be careful when you try to parse this percent versus that.”It is difficult to compare the vaccines head-to-head based on existing clinical trial data, but there are key differences.The most obvious is the dosing. J&J requires only one shot, although a second booster dose is being tested. Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines require two doses, a few weeks apart. Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines have, so far, been more effective than the J&J vaccine in clinical trials at preventing any symptomatic disease. Some experts quickly point out that the vaccines weren’t compared directly against one another, so the differences may be on paper only.But on paper, those differences appear significant: The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offer protection of more than 90%, while J&J’s efficacy against symptomatic disease is 66%. On the other hand, some people may prefer J&J’s one-and-done approach. It appears to offer protection against a variant that originated in South Africa. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear to be less effective against this variant, though it is unclear how much less effective and the companies are studying it.J&J is also cheaper and easier to ship than the other two shots.Yes, but: Whether the vaccines are equally as good or not, the efficacy numbers are already fueling the perception of a two-tiered vaccine system, the Washington Post reports.“J&J is going to be a challenge for all of us,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told WaPo in an interview.And if the J&J vaccine is heavily used in communities of color, which have already borne the brunt of the pandemic, trust could be further eroded.“If we end up with a hierarchy that says all rich White people get Pfizer, and all poor Black people get J&J, that would be a problem,” Helene Gayle, president and chief executive of the Chicago Community Trust, told the Post.What they’re saying: “The whole thing is awkward. Everyone is treading on eggshells, because we want to get the right message across,” said John Moore, a Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Cornell University. “The nuances are very hard because we don’t have concrete answers to every question.”In an ideal world, it may make sense to give the J&J vaccine to younger people, he said, because that would potentially lower the risk of resistant variants emerging. “The problem is, we don’t really have the luxury of time or of doing all the clinical trials you’d like to see done.”What we’re watching: "Trying to convince people that the vaccines are all equal isn’t going to work. People are making claims that go beyond the solid data we have, and that’s a risky proposition. We’re going to see the differences in rates of adverse events, for example, pretty quickly for ourselves once we know lots of people getting vaccinated," clinical-trial expert Hilda Bastian told Vox."Especially when the fear of major outbreaks subsides — prematurely — and we’re trying to get younger people to accept vaccination, adverse reactions are going to matter to people."The bottom line: “The worst option is no vaccine. And in the end, any of these approved vaccines is better than no vaccine, and that’s absolutely solid,” Moore said.Like this article?

"It\'s not just in the clinical trials, but it\'s also in real-world data," she added. Her comments seemed to be in reference to a CDC study released earlier on Monday that examined Moderna\'s and Pfizer\'s COVID-19 vaccines and found that in real-world conditions, they reduced the risk of infection by 90 percent two or more weeks after the second dose was administered. The CDC said the study demonstrated that the vaccines "can reduce both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections." Though Walensky expressed optimism over this finding and said "we can kind of almost see the end" of the pandemic based on the rate of vaccinations in the United States, she also reiterating her concern about COVID-19 cases ticking up. "What I really would hate to have happen is to have another oncoming surge just as we\'re reaching towards getting so many more people vaccinated," she said.

It’s possible we just don’t give the president enough credit for his FDR-like devotion to tackling this virus,” MSNBC host Brian Williams sarcastically said on Friday next to images of Trump golfing and not wearing a face mask. “His laser-like focus, his daily devotion, the sympathy he’s forever expressing to the families of the quarter million dead.”“Even the way the president lectures us in that way to please wear a mask and stop the spread.

In fact, the drug marker didn’t accept government money for the project.Since then, another drug company has released results indicating a second, more accessible vaccine could be fast-tracked by the FDA by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci on Thursday also called the efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine “extraordinary,” adding it is almost as effective as the measles shot.On Friday, Trump made the outlandish suggestion that those drug companies deliberately withheld successful results until after the election as a revenge-fueled plot to kick him out of office due to his crusade against prescription drug prices.Rivera said that he wished the American people could honor Trump by crediting him for the speedy vaccine “because he is definitely the prime architect of this Operation Warp Speed.”To date, the coronavirus has killed at least 250,000 Americans and infected nearly 12 million—a grim milestone that is only expected to skyrocket as the holiday season and winter loom.On Friday night, Williams seemed to allude to the tragic reality of the virus surging across the nation, calling out the president for refusing to follow virus mitigation recommendations pushed by his own public health officials, like mask-wearing and social distancing.“We are all painfully aware life in America will not feel anything close to normal until the coronavirus vaccine has been perfected and really distributed,” he said during his late night show, “The 11th Hour.”During his monologue about Trump\'s “laser focus” on the pandemic, Williams jokingly highlighted the success rate of other products named after the president.“What Trump Steaks did for the hungry, what Trump Water did for the thirsty in our nation, what Trump University did to lift up the uneducated in our country, well along comes Trump: The Vaccine,” Williams quipped. “Possibilities, I think you’ll agree, are endless.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"So I\'m not really suffering financially."Cheryl K. Smith, an author and editor who lives in Low Pass, Oregon, isn\'t in a rush to spend the money, either. She plans to save a portion, too, while donating the rest to a local food bank. "I\'m actually saving money right now," Smith said.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesPresident Donald Trump\'s demand to increase the already-approved $600 individual payment to $2,000, with backing from congressional Democrats, has dominated events in Washington this week and redefined the debate for more stimulus during the pandemic. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Wednesday he would not allow a vote on a stand-alone bill increasing the checks to $2,000, dooming the effort, at least for now.Whatever the amount, the reality is that most Americans right now are much more likely to save the money they receive.Of course, the money will be a lifesaver for the roughly 20 million people collecting unemployment benefits and others who are working reduced hours or earning less than they used to. Yet, for the majority of the estimated 160 million individuals and families who will receive it, spending the money is expected not to be a high priority.After an earlier round of $1,200 stimulus checks went out in the spring, the saving rate skyrocketed and remains at a nearly 40-year high. That largely reflects the lopsided nature of the pandemic recession that has put some Americans in dire straits while leaving many others untouched.Economists on the right and left of the political spectrum said that when otherwise financially secure people receive an unexpected windfall, they almost invariably save it. The free-market economist Milton Friedman highlighted this phenomenon decades ago.Many experts said a truly stimulative package would have earmarked the payments for those who need it most -- the unemployed."We know where the pockets of need are," said Greg Daco, chief economist at Oxford Economics. "Putting it there would be a much more efficient use of the stimulus."And because the money will immediately be put to work -- the jobless don\'t have the luxury of saving it -- it would also have a much bigger impact on the overall economy, through what experts refer to as the multiplier effect. In essence, each dollar given to a person in need is likely to benefit the economy more because it would be used to pay for, say, groceries or rent."Providing $2,400 to a family of four in the same financial situation as they were at the end of 2019 doesn\'t do much to boost the overall economy right now," Daco said. "It\'s not whether it\'s a positive or not. It\'s their potency that\'s in question."Individuals with an adjusted gross income in 2019 of up to $75,000 will receive the $600 payment, and couples earning up to $150,000 a year will get twice that amount. There is also a $600 payment for each child in families that meet those income requirements. People making more than those limits will receive partial payments up to certain income thresholds.A more effective approach, experts say, would have raised unemployment insurance benefits to the jobless by $600 a week, matching the supplement under the stimulus package Congress passed last spring, rather than the $300 weekly subsidy the new legislation provides. Democrats had pushed for larger payments to the jobless and included it in legislation that passed the House, which they control. But the measure met stiff resistance from Republicans, who control the Senate, and was not included in the final compromise bill.The money could also have been used to extend two key unemployment programs for much longer than the 11 weeks provided for in the new bill. The current extension runs only until mid-March, well before mass vaccinations are expected later in the spring and summer and the economy begins to return to normal."The economy is going to remain limited by the pandemic for the next six to nine months," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.Roughly 20 million Americans are collecting unemployment benefits and the jobless rate stands at 6.7%. One year ago, it was 3.5%, a half-century low.And there are signs with the economy sputtering, more Americans are giving up -- more than half a million people stopped looking for work and dropped out of the labor force just last month, meaning they are no longer counted among the unemployed.To be sure, the money from Washington will be welcomed by most Americans, even if they are financially secure. Besides saving it, others will use it to pay down debt, or invest it.A study released in August by three economists, Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Michael Weber, found that recipients of the $1,200 payments sent out under the CARES Act last spring largely held off on spending the money. Only 15% of people said they had spent it, or planned to spend it. Most said they would save the cash or use it to pay down debt.Of course, some of the money flowing into the economy could soon reach those who need it most. And it will provide a financial cushion even for middle-class families who are secure by most measures but remain on edge from the turbulence of 2020.But in terms of the multiplier effect, it\'s likely to pale in comparison to the impact in the spring, when the unemployment rate was much higher and there were real fears the country could experience a second Great Depression."The more you hit the stimulus button, the less impact you see," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. And the hardest hit sectors -- dining, entertainment and travel -- are unlikely to see much of a boost now, since consumers are wary of going out or live in states like California and New York where restaurant dining and other activities are restricted.Anderson said the stimulus could heighten some of the inequality that has become evident during the past year. Many white-collar employees are working from home and have largely been spared layoffs -- the unemployment rate for college graduates is now just 4.2%.But lower-paid service workers have been hit hard and the jobless rate stands at 7.7% for people with just a high school diploma. Better-off households, Anderson said, might spend the money on stocks or put it toward a home purchase, which could "aggravate a bubble forming in some assets like equities and housing."Julia Bald, a librarian who lives in Beverly, Massachusetts, isn\'t looking to bet on the stock market but she plans to put her stimulus check in the bank as a precaution. If the virus surges again and the library has to close down, she fears that she could be laid off. Bald also has $10,000 in outstanding student loans, and is trying to save as much money as she can."I haven\'t had much financial difficulty, it\'s not like I have to worry about back rent or anything," said Bald, 30. "But my nervousness about where the economy could go from here makes me want to save it just in case."Dennis Helmstetter of Frederick, Maryland, also plans to save the $600 payment. He has managed to keep not one, but three jobs during the pandemic -- as a real estate agent, a clerk at Fort Detrick and as a supervisor of the bar and restaurant at his local Elks Lodge.Because he hasn\'t been spending on travel, dining out or entertainment, he has been able to save more money than usual: putting away about $1,000 each month. While he\'s glad to see the extra boost to his savings, Helmstetter, 65, believes that Congress should have targeted the most needy people more directly."I think they\'re barking up the wrong tree," he said. "The money should go to the people who are unemployed right now."Others who feel similarly to Helmstetter are taking it upon themselves to redistribute their payments to those facing financial hardship.Serena Cooper, 26, plans to donate all of her stimulus check to someone who is unemployed. Cooper, a public relations assistant in Los Angeles, said she feels "blessed" to have kept her job during the pandemic, despite her own financial worries. At $32,000 a year, her salary has left her struggling to pay rent and other bills."In no way am I rich," she said. "But I feel like my $600 would make a bigger impact on someone who has been dealing with struggles far worse than I have during this pandemic."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

In a few weeks, Etihad Airways and Emirates will start using a digital travel pass, developed by the International Air Transport Association, to help passengers manage their travel plans and provide airlines and governments documentation that they have been vaccinated or tested for COVID-19. The challenge right now is creating a document or app that is accepted around the world, that protects privacy and is accessible to people regardless of their wealth or access to smartphones. Here’s what we know about the current status of digital vaccine passports. What is a vaccine pass or passport? A vaccination pass or passport is documentation proving that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Some versions will also allow people to show that they have tested negative for the virus, and therefore can more easily travel. The versions being worked on now by airlines, industry groups, nonprofits and technology companies will be something you can pull up on your mobile phone as an app or part of your digital wallet. “It’s about trying to digitize a process that happens now and make it into something that allows for more harmony and ease, making it easier for people to travel between countries without having to pull out different papers for different countries and different documents at different checkpoints,” said Nick Careen, senior vice president for airport, passenger, cargo and security at IATA. Careen has been leading IATA’s travel pass initiative. IATA is one of several organizations that have been working on digital solutions to streamline the travel credentialing process for years; during the pandemic, these groups have focused on including vaccination status. The idea is that if you have all the pertinent information on your phone, a significant amount of time will be saved. In addition to IATA, IBM has been developing its own Digital Health Pass that would enable individuals to present proof of vaccination or a negative test to gain access to a public location, such as a sports stadium, airplane, university or workplace. The pass, built on IBM’s blockchain technology, can utilize multiple data types, including temperature checks, virus exposure notifications, test results and vaccine status. The World Economic Forum and the Commons Project Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit group, have been testing a digital health passport called CommonPass, which would allow travelers to access testing or vaccination information. The pass would generate a QR code that could be shown to authorities. Why would I need a vaccine pass or passport? As more people are inoculated, there will likely be aspects of public life in which only people who have been vaccinated are allowed to participate. Take the upcoming Super Bowl LV in Tampa, Florida, where a significant portion of attendees will be vaccinated health care workers. (Careen of IATA said that sporting organizations, concert venues and tourism agencies have all reached out for identification tech support.) In order to travel internationally, government and health authorities will need to know if you have been vaccinated or have tested negative for the virus. Many countries are already requiring proof of a negative test for entry. Such passes could be essential to restarting the tourism industry, said Zurab Pololikashvili, secretary-general of the United Nations World Tourism Organization. “One key element vital for the restart of tourism is consistency and harmonization of rules and protocols regarding international travel,” he said in an email. “Evidence of vaccination, for example, through the coordinated introduction of what may be called ‘health passports’ can offer this. They can also eliminate the need for quarantine on arrival, a policy which is also standing in the way of the return of international tourism.” Dakota Gruener, executive director of ID2020, a global public-private partnership, said that there are three scenarios regarding digital credentialing for the coronavirus response. The first, which is largely off the table, is the creation of immunity certificates. These are documents that would show that people have developed some kind of immunity to the virus. The second scenario is being able to prove you’ve tested negative for the virus; the third is being able to show that you have been vaccinated. The last two scenarios, experts agree, are the most important for getting the travel industry going again. “We’re seeing a lot of interest from airlines, airline industry groups, customs and border control agencies and travelers, all saying, ‘How do I safely get on a plane or as a condition of entry into a country, get on a train, whatever the case may be, and prove that I have been tested or vaccinated?’” Gruener said. Gruener is one expert in a World Health Organization-sponsored group tasked with establishing global standards for digital vaccination certificates. Has this been done before? Having to prove you’ve been vaccinated in order to participate in activities or enter certain countries is not a new concept. For decades, people traveling to some countries have had to prove that they have been vaccinated against diseases such as yellow fever, rubella and cholera. Often, after being vaccinated, travelers received a signed and stamped “yellow card,” known as an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still urge people to take on relevant trips. “Everybody who has traveled internationally to countries that require vaccination against malaria, diphtheria and other things has had yellow cards,” said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Linux Foundation Public Health, a technology-focused organization helping public health authorities combat COVID-19 around the world. Its focus is helping projects, communities and companies build open-source technology. “Parents with kids in public school have had to prove their kids have been vaccinated. This is not something new.” But a major difference between the yellow card of years past and what is being worked on now is the digital component, which comes with new concerns around privacy and accessibility. The Linux Foundation is working in partnership with the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, a collective of more than 300 people from five continents to help develop universal standards for vaccine credential apps that make them accessible and equitable. The foundation is also working with IBM and CommonPass. “As these things get rolled out, it’s important for citizens to ask governments and airlines: How do we make this easy so I have one vaccination record to book a flight, hotel and so I can use that to do some other things,” Behlendorf said. “It should work like email. If it doesn’t, agitate for it.” Do vaccine passports have to be digital? Vaccine passports don’t have to be digital, but they would make the travel process smoother. “Imagine a future where a plane lands in an airport and a hundred people have a travel pass, 100 have another health wallet, 50 have bits of paper and another 25 have some kind of government document,” said Jamie Smith, senior director of business development at Evernym, a developer that has been working with IATA and others on developing a vaccine pass. “What does the airport do? How do they process all those people in a standard, simple way?” The European Union’s law enforcement agency said this week that sales of fake negative test results are becoming more widespread, another reason the industry is trying to develop digital passes that are secure. What are the objections to vaccine passports? In a world where more than 1 billion people aren’t able to prove their identity because they lack passports, birth certificates, driver’s licenses or national identification cards, digital documents that show vaccine status may heighten inequality and risk, leaving many people behind. That concern has been at the heart of Gruener’s work. “Long predating COVID, we were working on the intersection of digital credentials and immunization,” she said. “It’ll be years before vaccines are universally available on a global level, and thus widespread testing is going to continue and must continue alongside vaccination to enable a safe and equitable return to travel and other public activities.” For those without smartphones, the industry says it will accept paper proof, but even that needs to be standardized. In addition, there are concerns about privacy and data sharing. “There are ways this could be done right or done terribly wrong and the wrong ways could lead us to a techno dystopia,” said Jenny Wanger, director of programs at the Linux Foundation, adding that it’s important that the tech-building aspect of these apps be done in the open and doesn’t end up in the control of any one government or company. The technology should be open source and accessible to technologists, no matter who they are or where they are, she and others said. What are the challenges to creating these digital passes? Technologists and travel industry experts said that although it is possible to rush tech solutions that allow people to have one-use apps, creating long-lasting ethical technology or systems that will not store people’s data, or make it possible to track where they are, takes time. “The global passport system took 50 years to develop,” said Drummond Reed, chief trust officer for Evernym. “Even when they wanted to add biometrics to that to make it stronger, that took over a decade to agree on just how you’re going to add a fingerprint or a facial biometric to be verified on a passport. Now, in a very short period of time, we need to produce a digital credential that can be as universally recognized as a passport and it needs an even greater level of privacy because it’s going to be digital.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '4daff1b06b2fe59c084de23fd42c3166', 'title': "U.S. Rushes to Expand Vaccine Eligibility in a 'Race Against Time'", 'description': 'CHICAGO — Officials in at least 18 states have committed in recent days to opening coronavirus vaccine appointments to all adults in March or April, part of a fast-moving expansion as states race to meet President Joe Biden’s goal of universal eligibility by May 1. In Ohio, all adults will be allowed to seek shots starting March 29. In Connecticut, April 5. In Alaska and Mississippi, all adults are already able to book appointments. And Thursday, officials in Illinois, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Maryland and Missouri said that all adults would be allowed in April to sign up for a shot, while Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah said universal eligibility would begin there next week. But even as the pace of vaccinations has accelerated to about 2.5 million shots each day nationwide, the country finds itself at a precarious point in the pandemic. Cases, deaths and hospitalizations have all fallen sharply from January peaks, yet infection levels have plateaued this month, at about 55,000 new cases a day. While governors relax restrictions on businesses like bars, indoor gyms and casinos, highly infectious variants are spreading and some states, especially on the East Coast, have struggled for weeks to make any progress in reducing cases. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “I think it is a race against time,” said Dr. Stephen J. Thomas, SUNY Upstate Medical University’s chief of infectious disease. “Every single person that we can get vaccinated or every single person that we can get a mask on is one less opportunity that a variant has.” As parts of the country continue to see progress, many Americans are booking spring break trips, dining in newly reopened restaurants and replanning summer weddings that were abruptly canceled in 2020. All the while, the path ahead — and public guidance about how people should behave in this moment — seems uncertain, even contradictory. Although deaths have dropped considerably in New York, progress in reducing cases has stalled. The state has more recent cases per capita than everywhere except New Jersey, and the New York City metro area has the country’s second-highest rate of new infections, behind only Idaho Falls, Idaho. “People will be reckless; I don’t know how else to say it,” said Carol Greenberg, a pet care worker in Jersey City, New Jersey, who said she worried that people were starting to act in ways that did not accurately reflect the number of new virus cases in that state, where more than 26,000 new infections have been reported in the past week. Greenberg, 61, has been fully vaccinated, but her adult children have not, and she said she wondered whether all the reopening announcements of late were wise. In recent days, Gov. Phil Murphy urged a return to in-person instruction at New Jersey schools and announced a loosening of restrictions at restaurants, bars, salons and other businesses. No vaccine has yet been authorized for use in people under 16, though trials are underway to see if they are safe and effective in children. Public health researchers said they viewed the current moment in the pandemic as a sprint between vaccinations and newly confirmed cases of the virus, particularly infections that are spreading because of variants that can be more contagious. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, warned Friday “that it’s really quite risky to declare victory before you have the level of infection in the community to a much, much lower level than 53,000 cases per day.” “So it is unfortunate, but not surprising, to me that you are seeing increases in number of cases per day in areas — cities, states or regions — even though vaccines are being distributed at a pretty good clip of 2 to 3 million per day,” Fauci said. In Chicago, where students in the nation’s third-largest public school system have returned to classrooms, and where parks, bars and movie theaters are reopened, city officials announced that restaurant employees, construction workers and people who have preexisting health conditions would be newly eligible for vaccination by the end of March. Cook County, which includes Chicago, has averaged between 600 and 700 cases each day for nearly a month, down from about 4,500 cases a day at its November peak. “We’ve weathered a lot of storms over the course of this year,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said after visiting a vaccination site this week. “We’ve got to stay diligent. We’ve got to continue to work hard. But we are moving exactly in the right directions.” Still, the city’s usual outsize enthusiasm for observing a springtime ritual — going out on St. Patrick’s Day — was muted, at best. On Wednesday, few pedestrians were wandering on downtown streets, typically packed with revelers on the holiday. The Chicago River had been dyed its traditional bright shade of green, but the popular Riverwalk alongside it was nearly empty. Jacob Roberts, 29, was downtown Wednesday, taking a vacation from his home in Washington state. The trip to Chicago was a bucket-list visit he had always wanted to take. “I was cooped up in Washington and getting sick of everybody looking kind of down in the dumps,” he said. “But it’s honestly the same thing everywhere you look right now.” Although tourism has yet to return in force in places like New York and Chicago, the country’s outlook in battling the virus appears far better than when winter began. No state is reporting case numbers anywhere near record levels, and the sort of explosive case growth seen in hard-hit areas through 2020 has almost completely abated. Kansas is averaging about 215 new coronavirus cases a day, down from more than 2,000 in early January. In California, around 2,900 cases are reported most days, down from about 40,000 in mid-January. And North Dakota, which has the country’s most known cases per capita, is now regularly adding fewer than 100 cases a day, in a state with a population of 762,000. A projection by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation suggests that coronavirus cases will continue to slowly decline in the United States in the coming months. But with most Americans still unvaccinated and variants continuing to spread, there are warning signs in the data. Vermont, which escaped the worst of the pandemic in 2020, has struggled all of this year to curb an outbreak. Michigan, which had appeared to bring the virus under control in January, has seen case numbers increase by more than 80% over the past two weeks, though they remain well below their December peak. In South Florida, infection levels have remained persistently high, with about 1,000 cases reported each day in a single county, Miami-Dade. Even in states where the virus appeared far from under control, officials have proceeded to lift restrictions on businesses, and companies have pushed for reopenings. On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York announced that indoor fitness classes may resume Monday. In Southern California, where cases peaked early this winter, officials at Disneyland said that after more than a year of being closed, the theme park would open April 30 with rules in place limiting capacity. Around the country, some people said they were hesitant to dive back into old routines, even if their elected officials have indicated that it is permissible to do so. “I used to be regular at a gym twice a week or so, and I haven’t been since last February at all,” said Paul Eustice, 64, who lives in downtown Chicago. “I will not go in there where people are breathing heavily.” Last week, U.S. air travel rose to its highest level since the pandemic hit, and airline executives said that bookings in the coming months indicate an eagerness from Americans to begin traveling in large numbers again. Some of them are among the newly vaccinated. Since vaccinations began in December, the federal government has delivered more than 151 million vaccine doses, and about 77% have been administered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday, 66% of the country’s older population had received at least one vaccine dose, according to CDC data, with 39% fully vaccinated. At least 23 states have said they will expand vaccine eligibility to their general population on or before May 1, the deadline that Biden set last week, and officials have spoken more openly about what life might be like when the pandemic ends. “As more Montanans get the vaccine,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said as he announced that all Montana adults would be eligible April 1, “we will begin to approach the time when we are no longer in a state of emergency and we can remove our masks and throw them in the trash.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'b54d06254bad7f5bc2ebe5c0d67b816d', 'title': "Seniors Seeking Vaccines Have a Problem: They Can't Use the Internet", 'description': 'Annette Carlin feels trapped. Before the pandemic, Carlin, who is 84, loved to go on walks in Novato, California, with her grandchildren and dance at the senior center. Since March, though, she has been stuck indoors. She has been eager to sign up for a vaccine and begin returning to normal life. But booking an appointment has been a technological nightmare. Carlin cannot afford to buy a computer and would not know how to navigate the internet in search of a shot even if she could. While members of her family might be able to help her there, she avoids seeing them as a safety precaution. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It’s very frustrating,” Carlin said on her flip phone. “I feel like everybody else got the vaccine, and I didn’t.” The chaotic vaccine rollout has come with a maze of confusing registration pages and clunky health care websites. And the technological savvy required to navigate the text alerts, push notifications and email reminders that are second nature to the digital generation has put older adults like Carlin, who need the vaccine the most, at a disadvantage. As a result, seniors who lack tech skills are missing out on potentially lifesaving shots. The digital divide between generations has always been stark, but the pandemic’s abrupt curtailing of in-person interactions has made that division even more apparent. Advocates for older Americans, 22 million of whom lack wired broadband access at home, say it is ridiculous that a program mostly aimed at vaccinating vulnerable seniors is so dependent on internet know-how, Twitter announcements and online event pages. “We’re running into a crisis where connectivity is a life-or-death alternative for people,” said Tom Kamber, executive director of Older Adults Technology Services, a nonprofit that trains seniors to use technology. “It couldn’t get much more stark than people being told, ‘If you go outside, you’re likely to be at risk of dying.’” People in nursing homes, among the first to get vaccines, had staff to assist them. But when vaccines became available to a wider group of older adults in late December and early January, many who lived alone had to navigate the rollout by themselves. Federal agencies like the Administration for Community Living, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as nonprofits say they are doing what they can to guide older adults, but they are stretched thin. (Seniors can call the Administration for Community Living’s Eldercare Locator number for assistance at 1-800-677-1116.) “I don’t know where to go,” said Cheyrl Lathrop, a 74-year-old resident of Richmond, Virginia, who has watched younger, more tech-literate people nearby find ways to be vaccinated. “I get frustrated with the computer, and then I just give up.” Some seniors are relying on younger relatives to browse websites and stay up at all hours in hopes of booking a slot. Lathrop’s daughter, Sheri Blume, got her mother an appointment after weeks of searching. Terez Mays-Jones of Alpharetta, Georgia, had a similar experience looking for shots in Cincinnati, where her 73-year-old mother, Jacqueline Sims, lives. “It became a secondary job,” Mays-Jones, 53, said. “I was doing all these searches at all times of the day and evening.” Sims knows her way around Facebook and Instagram but still sometimes relies on her daughter for help online and said older adults often felt “intimidated” by technology. “At our age, we’re not used to making so many mistakes, or we don’t want to admit to our mistakes,” said Sims, who eventually secured a shot thanks to a tip from a cousin. Plenty of seniors do feel comfortable texting, tweeting and surfing the internet. But for those who do not, taking the time to learn a new skill often feels daunting, Kamber said. Older Adults Technology Services has taught 48,000 people how to get started online since the pandemic began, he said, and operates a tech support hotline. When vaccine sign-ups began, staff on the phones fielded thousands of questions about how to book appointments. Area Agencies on Aging, part of a national aging network funded by the federal government and overseen by the Administration for Community Living, are also helping out. Local chapters have been calling seniors and helping them register for vaccine appointments over the phone or in person, said Sandy Markwood, chief executive of the Area Agencies, which include more than 600 nonprofit regional centers that are guided by state governments. In Akron, Ohio, 78-year-old Lee Freund said every hospital, pharmacy and grocery store she had called in search of a vaccine directed her to a series of confusing webpages. Freund managed to accidentally sign up for grocery delivery but had no luck wrangling a shot. She ended up in tears. “When you’re alone, it’s frustrating, it’s overwhelming, and it’s very emotional,” said Freund, whose husband died last year. She said she did not call her children for help because she did not want to be a burden. “It almost made me think, ‘I don’t think that this is worth it.’” Freund finally found help with the nearby Area Agency on Aging, where a woman secured her an appointment. As of Thursday, about 24 million Americans ages 65 and older, or about 41%, had received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose, according to population and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., who has reintroduced a bill from last year that would allocate money to help get older Americans online, said the government had failed to get out ahead of a preventable crisis by not funding senior agencies sooner. Aging-network organizations “have been overwhelmed by the needs and the demands that they have and are struggling themselves working through the pandemic,” Smith said in an interview. “We have underresourced this, and we are seeing the effects of it.” The coronavirus relief bill passed by the House includes $470 million for supportive services for older Americans, including vaccine outreach. The Administration for Community Living is working with the CDC on a public awareness campaign for seniors, said Edwin Walker, the group’s deputy assistant secretary for aging. But that initiative is still in the planning stage. In the meantime, volunteer groups have popped up to help. In Miami, Katherine Quirk and her fiance, Russ Schwartz, started a Facebook group in January to disseminate information about vaccine availability in their area. The group has ballooned into 27,000 members seeking help and offering tips, and the effort has helped thousands get vaccinated. “It’s amazing, overwhelming,” said Quirk, 44, a nurse. “We’ve been called vaccine angels.” For those still waiting for their shot, though, hope seems far away. In Novato, Carlin spends her time watching the news on television in case there is a mention of where to get a shot. A granddaughter has been trying to find one for her, but without success. “I’m used to getting out and going and going and doing everything,” she said. If she were vaccinated, “I could go on with life, but now I feel like I’m on hold.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Adar Poonawalla, chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, needed $850 million so he could begin producing doses of promising coronavirus vaccines for the world\'s poor.Poonawalla calculated that he could risk $300 million of his company\'s money but would still be more than $500 million short. So he looked to a retired software executive in Seattle.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBill Gates, the Microsoft founder turned philanthropist, had known Poonawalla for years. Gates had spent billions to help bring vaccines to the developing world, working closely with pharmaceutical executives to transform the market. In doing so, he became the most powerful -- and provocative -- private player in global health.By the end of their conversation this summer, Gates had made a promise: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would provide a $150 million guarantee so the Indian factory could move ahead with production. By September, the foundation had doubled its commitment.It is part of an $11 billion effort to lay the groundwork to procure coronavirus vaccines for more than 150 countries, though it could eventually cost more. Funded largely with public money, the initiative is led by two global nonprofits that Gates helped launch and bankroll, along with the World Health Organization, which relies on the Gates Foundation as one of its largest donors.Working behind the scenes is the world\'s second-richest man, neither a scientist nor a doctor, who sees himself and his $50 billion foundation as uniquely prepared to take a central part. Gates and his team are drawing on connections and infrastructure the foundation has built over two decades to help guide the effort."We know how to work with governments. We know how to work with pharma. We\'ve thought about this scenario," Gates said in a recent interview. "We need -- at least in terms of expertise and relationships -- to play a very, very key role here."As the first vaccine candidates sprint toward regulatory approval, the question of how to immunize much of the world population has taken on added urgency. But nine months in, the success of the vaccine effort, known as Covax, is not at all certain.So far, it has pulled in only $3.6 billion in funding for research, manufacturing and subsidies for poor countries. Three companies have promised to deliver vaccines, but it is not yet known whether they will be effective. And it may be difficult to secure the necessary billions of doses in an affordable, timely way because the United States and other wealthy countries have cut separate deals for their citizens.In recent months, Gates has hosted online roundtables with drug company officials. He has pursued financial commitments from world leaders. He has consulted frequently with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s chief infectious disease expert and a longtime collaborator on vaccine initiatives. And to help staff the vaccine effort, his foundation has provided millions of dollars for McKinsey & Co. consultants.If the initiative, aided by Gates\' fortune and focus, manages to help protect the world\'s poor from a virus that has already killed more than 1.3 million people, it will affirm the strategies he has promoted in his philanthropic work, including incentives for drug companies.If the endeavor falls short, however, it could intensify calls for a more radical approach.Amid the pandemic, some public health officials and advocates argue that vaccine-makers, many of which have benefited from unprecedented public funding, should be compelled to share their technology, data and know-how to maximize production. India and South Africa, for example, are pushing to suspend the global enforcement of intellectual property rights involving the virus.Dr. Zweli Lawrence Mkhize, South Africa\'s health minister, said that the usual practices did not apply in this crisis. "There has to be a degree of broader consultation that looks at what is best for humanity," he said.In the current plan for a global vaccine deal, poor countries would receive only enough doses to inoculate 20% of their populations by the end of next year. Some models show that there will not be enough vaccines to cover the entire world until 2024."The consequence of longtime Gates strategies is that they go along with corporate control over supply," said Brook Baker, a Northeastern University law professor and policy analyst for Health GAP, which advocates equitable access to drugs. "In a pandemic, that is a real problem."Meanwhile, officials from some countries participating in the vaccine initiative complain that they were barely consulted until recently. "They are pushing us, cornering us, in order to make us pay," Juan Carlos Zevallos, Ecuador\'s health minister, said of the deal-makers. "We don\'t have a choice about which vaccine we would like to use. It is whatever they impose on us."\'The Bill Chill\'As a novel coronavirus linked to a live animal market began spreading rapidly in Wuhan, China, Gates watched from his office outside Seattle.On Feb. 14, he and leaders at his foundation, fearing a global threat, gathered to plan a response.Two weeks later, Dr. Seth Berkley -- chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a nonprofit the Gates philanthropy helped found -- flew to Seattle. He and Gates considered how to get COVID-19 vaccines to the developing world. On March 13, two days after the WHO declared a global pandemic, Gates conferred online with 12 top pharmaceutical executives, including the heads of Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, both of which have leading vaccine candidates.Gates became interested in immunizations in the late 1990s. Vaccines involved creating new technology, his specialty. Their impact was measurable; inexpensive doses could protect hundreds of millions against devastating disease. They were also about making deals.Many Western drug companies had stopped producing vaccines back then, finding them unprofitable. But through his giving, Gates helped create a new business model involving subsidies, advance market commitments and volume guarantees. The incentives drew in more manufacturers, resulting in many more lifesaving vaccinations.With a $100 million initial pledge, Gates helped create the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to invest in drugs and experimental vaccines. The foundation, which has about 1,600 employees, also funded academic researchers, installed its executives on the boards of multiple nonprofits and directly invested in drug companies.One of them was the German company BioNTech, which got a $55 million equity investment in September 2019. The business, partnering with Pfizer, announced last week that their jointly developed COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be 95% effective, and applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization.Some public health officials disagreed with Gates\' priorities, arguing that he should have directed more money to health systems. Others worried about a private individual wielding so much influence. But few people publicly criticized his foundation, fearful of losing its support. That self-censorship was so widespread it acquired a nickname: "the Bill Chill."At times, frictions were evident with the WHO, the United Nations agency charged with international public health. Gates felt frustrated with what he viewed as the organization\'s rigid bureaucracy and constraints on dealing with the private sector.Some at the WHO had concerns about his growing reach."The Gates Foundation presence has been, at best, an adjunct to WHO and at worst a hostile takeover and a usurpation," said Amir Attaran, a University of Ottawa professor of law and medicine.Today, the foundation and the WHO stress their mutual respect for each other.Capitalism at Work In March, Gates was urging drugmakers to move fast, cooperate with one another, open up their libraries of drug compounds and even share production responsibilities.The Gates Foundation employs former pharmaceutical executives in its top ranks. Working with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, they helped steer money into COVID-19 vaccine candidates and biotechnologies that could be quickly manufactured and suitable for the developing world.Some public health advocates and on-the-ground providers like Doctors Without Borders thought Gates was doing too little to pursue equitable access to vaccines and was too aligned with the pharmaceutical industry."Part of what they like about him is, he\'s protecting their way of life," James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that works to expand access to medical technology, said of Gates and drug industry executives.He and others believed that vaccine-makers would not maximize production for the developing world, especially when rich countries were clamoring for doses, because it wouldn\'t serve their bottom line. India and South Africa, in asking the World Trade Organization not to enforce coronavirus-related intellectual property rights, were seeking a way to wrest control of vaccines from big companies and ramp up local manufacturing.But Gates and many public health experts thought that most companies were taking laudable steps to help ensure access, such as nonprofit pricing and licensing of their technology to other manufacturers. They argued that drugmakers wouldn\'t take on the costly process of creating new products if their lucrative patents were jeopardized and that their control over their vaccines would ensure quality and safety."This capitalism thing -- there actually are some domains that actually works in," Gates said. "North Korea doesn\'t have that many vaccines, as far as we can tell."\'Acting Like a Lobbyist\'It was May 4, and the Gateses were on a video call with Boris Johnson. They congratulated the British prime minister on the birth of his son and asked about the COVID-19 case that had sent him to the hospital.Then they made their pitch: The world would never be safe from the virus and the global economy would never recover unless poor countries received vaccines and treatments too.Bill Gates had a long record of getting rich countries to provide funding for public health initiatives in poorer countries. Politicians saw him as a steward of public dollars with a nose for good investments.Leaders of wealthy countries were asked not only to help fund the initiative -- which was supporting development of nine potential vaccines -- but also to buy doses for their own populations.Companies either would charge all countries the same price or set tiered prices for low-, middle- and high-income nations; any could bow out if the price exceeded $21 per dose. Poor countries could get cheap, subsidized doses for up to 20% of their populations by the end of next year, but the wealthier nations could sign up for more.With so much attention on wealthy nations, there was little consultation with those the effort was intended to help most. It wasn\'t until the fall that lower-income countries learned they would have to pay $1.60 or $2 per dose, a significant price that would require some to secure bank loans or grants."It\'s going to be subsidized, yes, but countries still have to budget for their copay amount," said Chizoba Barbara Wonodi, the Nigeria director at the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. "So they need to be at the table when those discussions are made."Some middle-income countries have also felt squeezed, asked to pay prices in a higher tier, with little say as to what they would get or when they would get it.Zevallos, the Ecuadorian health minister, said he had spoken with fellow ministers in the region about raising concerns through their presidents. "They say, \'You don\'t get to choose, but you pay,\'" Zevallos said. "I\'m disappointed."Berkley, the Gavi director, acknowledged the frustration. "Did we communicate with everybody as well as we should? Absolutely not," he said. "But we did our best to try to do that."At the same time, Berkley said, "have we brought together the entire world to discuss equitable access to vaccines? Have we raised substantial amounts of funds? All of that is true."With coronavirus cases multiplying worldwide, Gates said there would be one simple way to judge the global vaccine initiative: "When did we stop the pandemic? That\'s the thing this all needs to be measured by."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Last week, House impeachment managers laid out their case against Trump, naming him "singularly responsible" for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and naming several instances where he allegedly provoked the attackers. But as Trump\'s lawyers said in a 78-page pretrial brief released Monday, combining all those allegations into just one impeachment article, among other flaws, mean the argument violates the Constitution. A good 10 pages of the Trump lawyers\' arguments is dedicated to the idea that the impeachment itself is "structurally deficient" and otherwise unconstitutional. "By charging multiple alleged wrongs in one article, the House of Representatives has made it impossible to guarantee compliance with" a piece of the Constitution that governs impeachment, the lawyers wrote. In addition, House Democrats\' "theory on insurrection collapses ... because it fails to describe any violation of law whatsoever," Trump\'s lawyers went on. Both of these flaws mean Trump\'s impeachment should be dismissed, they said. Trump\'s lawyers also argued against the concrete parts of the Democrats\' allegation of incitement. They went into length about just what the word "fighting" means, saying that as Trump spoke more than 10,000 before a crowd outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, he only said it "a little more than a handful of times and each time in the figurative sense." For example, while Trump said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) was "fighting the House," he "was not punching any of his fellow representatives," the lawyers write. Find the whole brief here.

Some of His Backers Don't Want to Take Them.", 'description': 'WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Graves, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, is not opposed to vaccines. She said she had taken flu shots and pneumonia shots and, having just turned 50, was interested in being vaccinated against shingles.But Graves, a legal transcriptionist in Starkville, Mississippi, said she would not be taking a coronavirus vaccine -- and the sight of Vice President Mike Pence rolling up his sleeve to get vaccinated on live television Friday, she added, would not change her mind.Lawrence Palmer, 51, a field service engineer in Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania, and Brandon Lofgren, 25, who works in his family\'s trucking and construction business in rural Wisconsin, said they felt the same way. Both are fans of Trump, and they echoed Graves, who said that she was "suspicious" of government and that Pence\'s vaccination "doesn\'t mean a thing to me."Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIt is a paradox of the pandemic: Helping speed the development of a coronavirus vaccine may be one of Trump\'s proudest accomplishments, but at least in the early stages of the vaccine rollout, there is evidence that a substantial number of his supporters say they do not want to get it.Until the past week, their objections were largely hypothetical. But with a second vaccine about to become available in the United States -- the Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized emergency use of the vaccine developed by Moderna, a week after the version developed by Pfizer and BioNTech won the same approval -- more people will confront the choice of getting inoculated or not. The authorization will clear the way for the shipment of 5.9 million doses over the weekend and tens of millions more in coming months, greatly expanding the reach of the vaccination campaign as the nation grapples with the uncontrolled spread of the disease.For the most part, public opinion has been swinging in favor of vaccination. Seventy-one percent of Americans are willing to be vaccinated, up from 63 % in September, according to a survey released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation.Still, the survey found that Republicans were the most likely to be hesitant, with 42% saying they would probably not or definitely not be vaccinated, compared with 12% of Democrats.Experts say that vaccine hesitancy may diminish over time if people see friends and relatives getting vaccinated without incident. Sheri Simms, 62, a retired businessperson in Northeast Texas who describes herself as a "moderate conservative" supporter of the president, said that while she did not intend to get vaccinated now, that could change."As more information comes out, and things appear to work better, then I will weigh the risks of the vaccine against the risk of the coronavirus and make a judgment," she said.The "anti-vaxxer movement" is not new, and it typically cuts across political parties. But the coronavirus vaccine, developed against the backdrop of a bitterly fought presidential election and championed by an especially polarizing figure in Trump, has become especially associated with partisanship.During the campaign, while Trump was promising a vaccine by Election Day, some Democrats expressed concern about whether safety would be sacrificed in the rush to deliver a vaccine in time to help the president at the polls.Political leaders in both parties worked on Friday to dispel concerns about the vaccine.Pence, who took the Pfizer vaccine on Friday in a ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, was not the only prominent public official to get vaccinated. On Capitol Hill, congressional leaders including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, were also inoculated against COVID-19. President-elect Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, are to be vaccinated Monday.In any other era, Pence\'s vaccination, administered by a technician from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in images beamed across the country, would have been a moment to bring the nation together. He took the shot in front of a giant blue poster declaring in white block letters: "SAFE and EFFECTIVE."His wife, Karen Pence, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams were also vaccinated."I didn\'t feel a thing -- well done," the vice president said afterward, adding that he wanted to "assure the American people that while we cut red tape, we cut no corners."But Trump was notably absent. One reason for the partisan divide over vaccination, experts said, is the president himself. His repeated denigration of scientists and insistence that the pandemic is not a threat, they said, have contributed to a sense among his followers that the vaccine is either not safe or not worth taking."I just don\'t feel there\'s been enough research on it. I think it was sped up too fast," said Mark Davis, 42, a disabled worker in Michigan. "You don\'t even really know the side effects, what\'s in it."Lofgren agreed. "The jury\'s out on whether it\'s going to work," he said, despite studies showing that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were more than 94% effective.Experts say that "herd immunity" -- the point at which so many people are immune that the spread of a virus is diminished -- can be achieved when roughly 75% of the population is vaccinated. While the Trump administration is rolling out a public relations campaign to encourage people to get vaccinated, the reluctance among even a minority of Republicans is deeply troubling to public health experts.Trump has been quick to claim credit for the manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine. "Distribution to start immediately," he said Friday on Twitter, a day after an FDA expert advisory panel recommended approval of Moderna\'s vaccine.Although the president has recovered from COVID-19, he remains vulnerable to reinfection. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\'s top infectious disease scientist, has recommended that Trump be vaccinated. But he has given no indication that he will actually do so, and he has said little, if anything, to encourage Americans to get vaccinated."We need him taking a proactive role," said Matthew Motta, a political scientist at Oklahoma State University who studies politics and vaccine views, adding, "The single best person to convince you to change your mind about something is somebody who agrees with you, somebody who you trust on other issues."Trump\'s flirtations with vaccine skepticism are well known. He repeated the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism as far back as 2007, when he said he had slowed his son Barron\'s vaccination schedule, and as recently as 2015 while first running for president."Trump helped reenergize the anti-vaccine movement," said Dr. Peter Hotez, an expert on vaccines, "and now he wants to pivot and make this his greatest accomplishment."Some conservative news media outlets are reinforcing the skepticism, tapping into suspicion of government by raising questions about whether officials are leveling with the public about the risks of the vaccines.Tucker Carlson, a Fox News commentator, railed Thursday against the "corporate image campaign" promoting vaccination, suggesting incorrectly that isolated instances of allergic reactions to the vaccine were being censored.In interviews, Trump supporters said they felt the pandemic had been blown out of proportion. Lofgren said several of his co-workers had recovered from COVID-19, "with really no more than just cold symptoms." Palmer said that if he "had an issue with breathing or a heart issue or a lung issue," he might consider it, but does not want to take a chance.Conspiracy theories -- including the notion that the virus was created by the Chinese and Democrats to hurt Trump politically, or the vaccine contains a microchip allowing the government to track people -- cropped up in several conversations. Graves, who has diabetes, a risk factor for COVID-19, and has a master\'s degree in library science, said such thoughts were creating doubts in the back of her mind."There\'s no, quote, evidence that there\'s a microchip or that there\'s something nefarious about the whole thing," she said. "But I have a gut check about all of it, and the government pushing it, and they\'re finding all these popular people to take the vaccine. And it\'s weird, like why are we pushing it so hard?"This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The vaccine is expected to be approved for use in the European Union on Friday, but a draft recommendation from Germany’s vaccine authorities issued on Thursday called for its use to be restricted to those aged between 18 and 64. “There is currently insufficient data to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine from 65 years of age,” the Standing Vaccine Commission (Stiko) at the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s main centre for disease control, said. The move comes with the European Union locked in an increasingly fraught dispute with AstraZeneca, the makers of the Oxford vaccine, and there are bound to be accusations it is politically motivated. But the German recommendation was issued by an independent panel of doctors and scientists, who released detailed figures to back their findings. They did not conclude the vaccine is ineffective in older people, but only that clinical trials had simply not included enough test subjects aged over 65 to provide any reliable data. Just 341 test subjects aged over 65 were given the vaccine in clinical trials, compared to 5,466 aged between 18 and 64, according to Stiko figures. A second control group who were not given the vaccine included only 319 people over 65, compared to 5,510 aged between 18 and 64. “It’s that we have today a limited amount of data in the older population,” Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, conceded in an interview with Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper earlier this week. “Oxford is an academy group. They’re very ethical and very academic. So they didn’t want to vaccinate older people until they had accumulated a lot of safety data in the 18 to 55 group... But we have strong data showing very strong antibody production against the virus in the elderly, similar to what we see in younger people. It’s possible that some countries, out of caution, will use our vaccine for the younger group.” The wording of the German recommendation suggested the EU’s European Medicines Agency (EMA) is likely to approve the vaccine for all adults on Friday, and leave individual member states to make their own decisions whether to use it for older people.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'ba94960b15369a8a805b6d1c2675e314', 'title': 'Biden is apparently determined to focus on infrastructure this week', 'description': 'One leitmotif of former President Donald Trump\'s tenure was his administration announcing "infrastructure week" at the White House — only to have Trump, or circumstances beyond the president\'s control, intervene and demolish any such plans. President Biden, however, appears determined to make "infrastructure week" something other than a punch line. And this week, a sort of infrastructure week, should test his resolve. "Biden is putting his foot on the gas pedal and moving ahead with his plans to sell an expansive infrastructure proposal this week," even as he "faces mounting pressure to act on other legislative priorities that have become increasingly difficult to ignore," USA Today reports. He will lay out the contours of his infrastructure plan, expected to cost up to $3 trillion, at an event in Pittsburgh on Wednesday. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Fox News Sunday that Biden has decided to break his "Build Back Better" plan into two legislative proposals, the first of which will deal with broadly popular items like rebuilding roads and bridges, shoring up railroads, and expanding broadband to rural communities — projects Republicans have supported in the past. "I will say that I don\'t think Republicans in this country think we should be 13th in the world as it relates to infrastructure," Psaki said, referring to a World Economic Forum ranking. "Roads, railways, rebuilding them — that\'s not a partisan issue." Biden will release the second proposal, focused on the "caregiver economy" — expanding access to child care and health care, for example — in April, she added. Biden is probably wise to take "a kind of hard-nosed assessment about what\'s politically possible and moving forward on those items," William Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, tells USA Today. "The politics of infrastructure aren\'t like the politics of gun violence. It\'s about decaying roads and bridges that are not quite as safe as they once were. If you say we\'ve got to always respond to the latest crisis, most of the time, you\'re going to put infrastructure on the back burner."

{'_id': '40fe633aedbfab2f76d71f1862dd1bc0', 'title': 'Here Comes the Biden Blame Game', 'description': 'During the eight years that President Obama and his team managed the economy, Americans were regularly assured that the president’s Keynesian policies would deliver striking growth in the years ahead. The growth repeatedly failed to materialize, and what followed was a master class in blamesmanship. No matter how far into the Obama term we were, the disappointing growth was a “new normal”- not the result of President Obama’s high tax and heavy regulatory policies. It was all the fault of the Bush administration. In some sense, Bush was portrayed for the entire eight years as a comic book villain. His policies were so terrible that they were able to overwhelm the economy for years.Watching Vice President Biden prepare to be president gives one a strong feeling of déjà vu. Last week he called on Congress to pass Nancy Pelosi’s large and untargeted stimulus bill, chock-full of candy that is poison to Senate Republicans, such as a massive bailout for blue states. He added that it is going to be a “long dark winter” with the emphasis on long, and promised to return to his “Build Back Better” agenda of tax hikes and regulatory crackdowns as soon as possible.Before they storm the castle, perhaps the Biden team should make a list of their assets. The first asset is a strong economy. The COVID-19 pandemic recession likely ended in the third quarter of this year, when real GDP advanced a whopping 33.1 percent. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate for the fourth quarter suggests it will post growth around six percentage points. Combining the two, that means that the economy will about return to the level of GDP it posted right before the pandemic began, back when we had the strongest economy in generations. So the “back” part of the Biden slogan is superfluous, as the economy will likely be back before he takes office. As has been discussed at length in this space, that agenda doesn’t build at all, but rather subtracts from economic activity. So it doesn’t build, we are already back, and it’s worse than the status quo.The second asset is a vaccine. We are very close to the widespread availability of two enormously successful vaccines. More could well be on the way. Most Americans should be able to receive them by the spring. This means that the acceleration in the economy that is currently underway should, if we leave it alone, pick up steam as things head back to a post-pandemic normal.The third asset is a likely Republican-controlled Senate that has already shown that it is able to pass significant stimulus legislation. But it is not going to hand out cash to blue state willy nilly as the House Democrats have proposed.Which completes the setting. The economy is carrying enormous positive momentum into next year. Since the case load is spiking now, there is some chance that lockdowns will get worse before they get better. Firms around the country need to tread water for a few more months, after which they can return to normal. The risk is that there is a wave of bankruptcies between now and the late spring, that is set off by a return to widespread shutdowns. To face this risk, the administration needs to show it is serious about finding a compromise stimulus package, and cognizant that a promise of massive tax hikes next year is a negative for business sentiment. Businesses that are just hanging on with hope of a brighter future could well give up if that future includes a government that taxes away all their profits.Unfortunately, Vice President Biden has come out with exactly the opposite of this message. By sticking to the Pelosi bill, he fails to signal a willingness to compromise, suggesting to those holding out for another round of stimulus that they have little to hope for. And the future is dark as well, since the administration’s tax hikes are coming. In other words, he seems poised to fritter away all of the economic gains that the U.S. has achieved in the second half of this year. If the double-dip recession hits next year, Biden will remind us over and over that its Donald Trump’s fault. My guess is that he will find a way to mention Bush as well.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

A study by Maccabi, an Israeli healthcare provider, found that only 20 of around 128,000 people had caught the disease when tested around a week after receiving their second dose. "New data from Maccabi Healthcare Services, one of the largest healthcare providers in Israel, shows that only 20 people out of ~128,600 have been infected with the COVID-19 virus, more than a week after receiving the second dose of the vaccine," the healthcare provider said in a statement on Monday night. Around half of the 20 patients who did contract Covid had chronic symptoms, while the rest reported mild symptoms such as a cough, headaches and fatigue. Anat Ekka Zohar, a senior doctor at Maccabi, said: "This is very encouraging data. We will monitor these patients closely in order to examine if they continue to suffer from mild symptoms only and do not develop complications as a result of the virus". It came as Israeli health officials said they were confident that their Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were effective against all news strains of the virus, including the UK variant. "The vaccine works against the British mutation but the virus infection rate is much faster than the vaccine rate," said Dr Sharon Alroy-Preis, the Israeli government\'s public health chief. Israeli officials have warned that as much as 70 per cent of new coronavirus cases in the country may have been caused by the UK strain, and that children are more likely to catch it than first expected. "Forty per cent of illness is in children, a higher percentage than their part in the population," Dr Alroy-Preis told Israeli reporters on Monday. "We see a rise in infections in ages six to nine, which is exactly the age group that is supposed to go back to school [at the end of lockdown].” More than a quarter of Israel’s population has been vaccinated against coronavirus, with over-40s given priority. Over the weekend, Israel expanded the scheme to include 16 to 18-year-olds so they can sit important high school exams on schedule. Meanwhile Nachman Ash, the Israeli coronavirus tsar, said he believed the vaccines would be effective against all new strains but was particularly confident about the UK variant. "Most of the mutations we believe the vaccines will stop, we know this with a very high probability regarding the British variant,” he told Israeli radio station 103 FM. Meanwhile, some members of Israel’s ultra-orthodox Jewish community have taken to the streets to protest against the country’s third nationwide lockdown. A bus driver was dragged from his seat and the vehicle set ablaze during a riot in the Israeli city of Bnei Brak on Monday. Israeli officials say that 9.3 per cent of the coronavirus tests results recorded on Sunday came back as positive, the second-highest level this month. More than a thousand people have died from coronavirus in Israel this month, bringing the total death toll to 4,419.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Moderna says its experimental shot is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19.               That&#39;s based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial.               It makes it the second U.S. company to report results that far exceed expectations.               Together with the Pfizer vaccine, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the U.S. could have two vaccines authorised for emergency use by December.               A key advantage of Moderna&#39;s vaccine is that it does not need ultra-cold storage like Pfizer&#39;s, making it easier to distribute.               Production of the Moderna shots will partially be carried out by Swiss biotechnology firm Lonza at plants in the U.S. and Switzerland.               The news sent Moderna shares up around 17 percent.               Also on Monday, Russia said it expects to produce primarily freeze-dried Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine doses by the spring.               That would eliminate the need for transport at ultra-low temperatures.               Russia has an ambitious plan to inoculate its population.               But vaccine developers globally are scrambling to work out how to ship and store their vials, some of which must be kept in specialised freezers at extremely low temperatures.               The logistical challenge was brought into sharp focus after promising interim trial data for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer.               It&#39;s been considered a major breakthrough in the race to curb the pandemic.               But it needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, equivalent to an Antarctic winter.               That poses a challenge for even the most sophisticated hospitals.

This uplifting news couldn\'t have come at a more desperate time, as America\'s coronavirus death toll tragically topped a quarter of a million people this week. Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), spoke with NPR\'s Morning Edition to shed light on what might come next: chiefly, when the first doses of the COVID vaccine will become available, and who will be first in line to be inoculated once they are. Read on to hear what he had to say, and for more on the COVID vaccine, check out Dr. Fauci Says This Many People Need to Get Vaccinated to Stop COVID."The timeline of getting the doses into the vials and available for vaccination are going to be a graded process," Fauci began. "It\'s not going to happen all at once." As he explained, both candidates are currently in the process of filing for emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and pursuing licensure. The first round of vaccinations could be given as soon as the end of next month—meaning Dec. 2020—to people on a "priority list" that will be determined by an advisory committee and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The list, Fauci said, will be driven by dual purposes of protecting those most at risk and reopening the economy. Read on to find out who will likely top the list, and for more advice from Fauci, check out the 4 Places Dr. Fauci Says He Wouldn\'t Go Right Now.Read the original article on\xa0Best Life. 1 Heath care workers"We hope that we\'ll be getting vaccine into people [in December]," Fauci told NPR. "The recommendation of who that will be will be finalized by the CDC—[but it] likely will be health care workers." And for more updates on getting inoculated, You Need to Quit This Bad Habit Before Getting a COVID Vaccine, Study Says. 2 People who are high riskIn the same breath, Fauci mentioned that "people who are at a high risk for serious disease" will also be prioritized.As someone who is over the age of 65, 79-year-old Fauci is considered to be in a high-risk group. People often ask him when he\'ll personally feel comfortable getting a vaccine, and his answer when asked by The New York Times recently was encouraging: "It\'s pretty easy when you have vaccines that are 95 percent effective. Can\'t get much better than that," he said. And if you\'re curious about how the trials are going, check out This Is What Getting a COVID Vaccine Feels Like, Volunteers Say. 3 TeachersNPR interviewer Rachel Martin asked Fauci if teachers would be high on the list for the COVID vaccine, to which Fauci said, "Oh, absolutely." The Wall Street Journal argued this week that vaccinating teachers directly after health care workers would be a "vital" step in our efforts to restart the U.S. economy. And for more news on kids and COVID, check out The CDC Just Quietly Removed Its Most Controversial Guidelines. 4 Child care providersIn referring to teachers, Fauci also confirmed that child care providers will be high priority for the COVID vaccine.

He didn\'t specify who exactly.Then, after vaccinating the priority group, the general population can expect access to the COVID vaccine "by the time you get to, let\'s say, the end of April, the beginning of May, June, July, as we get into the second quarter," Fauci said.

However, Biden also said “we got into office and found out…there was nothing in the refrigerator, figuratively and literally speaking, and there were 10 million doses a day that were available.” (The Biden administration’s initial target was to administer 1 million vaccine doses per day, a pace already set by the time the president was sworn in.) “It’s one thing to have the vaccine, which we didn’t have when we came into office, but” one also needs “a vaccinator,” Biden subsequently told Cooper, when asked about the logistics of getting shots to Americans. The U.S. is currently administering coronavirus vaccine doses at a seven-day rolling average of 1.7 million per day, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. The pace of vaccinations has risen steadily since December 15, when a New York nurse received the first shot outside of a clinical trial. The Biden administration has downplayed the efforts of the previous administration in aiding the development and distribution of COVID vaccines.

{'_id': '442c565e93753cf2fa34ac3d746c06bb', 'title': 'Brian Kemp Cast His Lot With Trump, and Has Now Paid the Price', 'description': 'ATLANTA -- Few politicians have been both elevated and diminished by the vicissitudes of President Donald Trump like Brian Kemp, Georgia\'s Republican governor.Kemp rocketed from hard-right underdog candidate to the governor\'s mansion two years ago on the strength of a surprise endorsement from Trump, and an argument that the president was right about a lot of issues facing the country.But these days Kemp is facing daily reminders of the perils of deciding that Trump is actually wrong.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIn recent weeks, Kemp has infuriated the president for resisting his demands to help overturn the election results in Georgia, a state Trump lost by roughly 12,000 votes. The president\'s outrage has spread to many of his supporters in Georgia as he persists in his extraordinary intervention into the nation\'s electoral process.At a news conference in the state Capitol on Tuesday to discuss the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine, Kemp was confronted by Trump loyalists asking why he had refused to call a special session of the legislature, as the president has requested, so that lawmakers can reallocate the state\'s 16 electoral votes to Trump. The question crowded the screen of a Facebook live feed of the event. As he departed the event, Kemp was stopped by a small group who presented a bag that they said was filled with 2,000 petitions making the same plea."If he doesn\'t call a special session, he\'s definitely a one-term governor, no doubt about it," said one of the activists, Erik Christensen, CEO of a moving company, who said he voted for Kemp in 2018.Kemp is now the most vivid example of the battle-scarred and even shellshocked conservative Republicans who once basked in Trump\'s glow but now find themselves derided for enforcing their state election rules and laws. Republican governors like Kemp and Doug Ducey of Arizona, and lower-level state officials like Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Georgia, have emerged as a new kind of institutionalist in the face of the Trump attacks on the election system: They are refusing to bend procedures to the will of Trump, and potentially paying a political price for it.As Trump continues to grope for a way to undo his electoral loss to President-elect Joe Biden, he is also engaged in a furious effort to torpedo Kemp\'s political future.Trump has called Kemp "hapless," mocked him for a supposed dip in popularity, and suggested, at a recent rally, that U.S. Rep. Doug Collins should challenge Kemp in the primary when he seeks a second term in 2022."I\'m ashamed that I endorsed him," Trump said in a Fox News interview.The president\'s willingness to threaten the governor\'s fervently pro-Trump voter base demonstrates how challenging it may be for Republicans to navigate a post-presidency in which the mercurial Trump could choose to play kingmaker, de facto party head and potential 2024 candidate.Republican politicians, strategists and party officials are anxiously watching the turmoil in Georgia, fearing that the civil war the president started among Georgia\'s Republicans could spread throughout the country. That would complicate the political dynamics for incumbents like Kemp, who plans to run for reelection two years from now.In November\'s election, Trump expanded the party base, driving up margins in rural areas, winning a larger share of Latino voters and capturing a record number of Republican votes. Whether those new voters will transform into loyal Republicans when Trump is not on the ticket remains one of the biggest uncertainties facing the party. And much may depend on what Trump tells Republicans to do."Any operative is wondering right now whether this is what the future looks like," said Henry Barbour, a Republican committeeman from Mississippi and an influential voice in the party. "We don\'t know, but the party has a tremendous opportunity going forward to build on what the president has accomplished."Kemp, 57, has not been the only target of Trump\'s wrath. Republican politicians and officials across the country who have defended the integrity of the election -- and resisted bending to the will of the president -- have faced a backlash from their own party.In Arizona, Trump has criticized Ducey for certifying Biden\'s win in that state, and suggested he would also pay a political price for it. ("Republicans will long remember!" he wrote in a recent tweet.) While term limits prevent Ducey from seeking another term, he is among those mentioned as a potential presidential contender in 2024.On the day that Ducey was selected to head the Republican Governors Association, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona said in a column on a conservative news site that Ducey had "harmed the common cause of the Republican Party.""The Duceys and the Kemps of the world, they may have some difficulty if they want to seek elective office within the Republican Party," said Michael Burke, chairman of the Republican Party in Pinal County in Arizona. "People will remember what happened here," added Burke, who worked at Trump\'s properties before becoming involved with politics.Allies of the president have begun issuing veiled threats toward Kemp, warning that what they see as his insufficient loyalty to the president could carry a political price."If you\'re not fighting for Trump now when he needs you the most as a Republican leader in Georgia, people are not going to fight for you when you ask them to get reelected," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an appearance on Fox News.Democrats are trying to exploit these divisions. MeidasTouch, a progressive national political committee, announced plans this week to put up billboards in Georgia emblazoned with a Trump tweet that reads, "Why bother voting for Republicans if what you get is Ducey and Kemp?" Biden plans to travel to the state next week to campaign for the two Democratic candidates, who would give his party control of the Senate if they won runoffs against Republican incumbents on Jan. 5.Kemp\'s descent from Trump\'s circle of approval is particularly striking. Throughout his career, he has taken pains to demonstrate his conservative credentials: In one particularly unsubtle ad that ran during his 2018 run for governor, titled "So Conservative," he demonstrated his desire to "blow up government spending" with actual explosives, and "cut regulations" with a real chain saw.It was Trump\'s positive tweet just days before the Republican primary runoff that helped Kemp gain the nomination. Then in the general election, Kemp became one of the Trump era\'s most enduring villains in the eyes of the left after his narrow victory over Stacey Abrams, who was vying to become the nation\'s first Black woman governor.Abrams and her allies argued that Kemp, then the secretary of state, engineered a "stolen" election by supporting policies that Democrats said amounted to voter suppression and in some cases targeted minorities.Since then, much of Kemp\'s political personality had been borrowed directly from Trump. Billing himself as a "politically incorrect conservative," Kemp has echoed Trump\'s hyperbolic message about the violent threats immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally pose to American citizens.Despite his rhetoric, Kemp has not played the role of radical disrupter the way doctrinaire former Republican governors like Sam Brownback of Kansas or Bobby Jindal of Louisiana did. But he has delivered for his conservative base by supporting and signing an anti-abortion "heartbeat" law, which was permanently enjoined by the courts.Other policy actions, including a raise for public schoolteachers, and a slew of appointments reflecting the state\'s burgeoning diversity, suggest some movement on Kemp\'s part toward a practical center. But much of that has been overshadowed by criticism of his reopening of the state in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic and his conflicts with the Democratic mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, including over her efforts to implement a mask mandate.Still, this generally conservative track record has not stemmed the torrent of criticism that is engulfing the governor from the right. Nor have Kemp\'s delicate -- or perhaps awkward -- efforts to praise Trump while steadfastly declining to give him the overturned election results he wants. At the news conference on Tuesday, for instance, Kemp talked about how "grateful" he was for the Trump administration\'s "unprecedented and incredible achievement" of making the vaccine available.A Republican consultant in Georgia familiar with Kemp\'s thinking said that while the governor agrees with many of Trump\'s policies, the president\'s request that he work to overturn the election -- a request Trump made in a phone call with the governor last weekend -- crossed a line.Kemp\'s office declined to make him available for an interview.Kemp\'s relationship with the president began to seriously deteriorate late last year when he defied Trump\'s wishes and appointed Kelly Loeffler, a wealthy Atlanta businesswoman, to an open Senate seat. Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue are the Republican candidates in the Georgia runoffs in January.Kemp will have to run on a ticket in 2022 with whoever wins the Senate seat. By choosing Loeffler, he was most likely trying to craft the image of the state Republican Party in a way that he thought would reflect Georgia\'s evolving politics: a female candidate who he believed could win back more moderate voters in Atlanta\'s populous northern suburbs. He also considered Loeffler, a political novice, a good fit for his brand, which he considers to be pro-business, outside the establishment and conservative.Trump preferred that the Senate seat go to Collins, the conservative Georgia Republican who had passionately defended Trump against impeachment. Collins subsequently jumped into this year\'s race, losing in the first round of voting but pushing Loeffler far to the right to prove her conservative bona fides.A similar dynamic could emerge if Trump backs a primary challenger in the 2022 governor\'s race. That could lead Kemp to lurch rightward after he has made some effort to move to the center. Such a shift might help Abrams, who may challenge Kemp in a rematch.But all of these projections are clouded with questions about the president himself. Will he get involved in 35 local and statewide races, or concentrate on two or three? Will he settle old scores? Kemp\'s political future may depend on the answer."I\'m 100% Donald Trump. I\'m 100% Brian Kemp," said former Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., a Trump ally. "I believe it\'s just something that we\'ve got to get through."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The Trump administration did not track vaccines between federal distribution and administration to patients, Biden officials told Politico. Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/AP The Biden administration has spent its first week in office attempting to manually track down 20m vaccine doses in the pipeline between federal distribution and administration at clinic sites, when a dose finally reaches a patient’s arm. The Trump administration’s strategy pushed the response to the coronavirus pandemic to individual states and omitted pipeline tracking information between distribution and when the shot is actually administered, Biden administration officials told Politico. The lack of data has now forced federal health department officials to spend hours on the phone tracking down vaccine shipments, the news website reported. “Nobody had a complete picture,” Dr Julie Morita, a member of the Biden transition team and executive vice-president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told Politico. “The plans that were being made were being made with the assumption that more information would be available and be revealed once they got into the White House.” As of Saturday, 49 million doses of vaccine have been distributed by the federal government, but only 27 million administered by states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About two million of those doses are believed to be accounted for by a 72-hour lag in reported administration, Politico reported. That still leaves millions in the pipeline between delivery and patient. At least 16 states have used less than half the vaccine doses distributed to them, USA Today reported this week. “Much of our work over the next week is going to make sure that we can tighten up the timelines to understand where in the pipeline the vaccine actually is and when exactly it is administered,” Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, told USA Today. Among the problems in the rollout identified by the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices are the need to improve scheduling, increase staffing and define administration site workflows. States must also improve supply-demand mismatch. In one example, a hospital in Arlington, Virginia, had to cancel 10,000 appointments after the state sent doses to county health departments. The state then directed patients to reschedule appointments through the county health department as they became available. “It’s very disappointing,” Jeff Gorsky, a resident whose 3 February appointment was canceled, told NBC4 Washington. “We’re all stuck in the house, I rarely leave my house now, just to go grocery shopping. It would have freed me up.” Similarly in Wisconsin, lawmakers quizzed the state’s health department on where 180,000 federally distributed vaccines that had yet to be administered were in the pipeline, according to a report from the right-leaning MacIver Institute. A state health department official told lawmakers there was not enough vaccine to meet demand, but also that 50% of the doses had been set aside for a pharmacy partnership to vaccinate staff and residents of long-term care homes. But adding to the confusion, a spokesperson for the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin later said pharmacies had not received the doses from the health department, and still others were set aside for second shots despite federal guidance not to do so. “Some of [the vaccine] was being held back for second doses,” said Danielle Womack, a spokesperson for the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, the MacIver Institute reported. Wisconsin does not expect a vaccination scheduling website to go live until February, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. If the Biden administration can’t get a handle on the rollout, inequities could also exacerbate racial health disparities between the populations worst impacted by Covid-19 and already behind in immunization. An early look at the 17 states and two cities that have released racial breakdowns through 25 January found black people in all places are getting inoculated at levels below their share of the general population, in some cases significantly below. “We’re going to see a widening and exacerbation of the racial health inequities that were here before the pandemic and worsened during the pandemic if our communities cannot access the vaccine,” said Dr Uché Blackstock, a New York emergency physician and CEO of Advancing Health Equity, an advocacy group that addresses bias and inequality. That is true even though they constitute an oversize percentage of the nation’s health care workers, who were put at the front of the line for shots when the campaign began in mid-December. For example, in North Carolina, black people make up 22% of the population and 26% of the health care workforce but only 11% of the vaccine recipients so far. White people, a category in which the state includes both Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites, are 68% of the population and 82% of those vaccinated. The racial immunization gap is partly explained by higher levels of distrust of medical personnel by racial minorities who for centuries have been subject to abusive and discriminatory medical practices. However, it is also a practical matter. In Florida, a plan to distribute Covid-19 vaccines through pharmacies with the supermarket chain Publix – which have been shown to cluster in affluent communities – left residents of Belle Glade 25 miles from the nearest vaccine center. Most residents of the predominantly black community “walk everywhere they go”, said Mayor Steve Wilson. The state later provided a vaccine site for the community. The CDC’s first report on early vaccine rollout is expected in February. The Associated Press contributed to this report', 'num_of_covid': 2}

U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hanock said enough doses of both vaccines are on order to give the entire population two jabs, and he\'s "highly confident that we can get enough vulnerable people vaccinated by the spring that we can now see our route out of this pandemic."Skeptics may want some caveats attached to that statement since the Oxford-AstraZenca vaccine had some mixed results in clinical trials. Data revealed earlier this month showed it was 62 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections, which is not as high as the roughly 95 percent efficacy rate attributed to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna candidates. But the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot is nevertheless considered safe, and none of the volunteers developed a severe infection or were hospitalized, key metrics in determining the success of a vaccine. It also comes with a few key logistical advantages that could be a game-changer. It\'s cheap to produce, and unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doesn\'t require ultra-cold temperatures for storage, which will make vaccine distribution easier, especially to rural communities. Finally, the gap between the first and second dose of the vaccine can be as long as 12 weeks, which means more people in the U.K. can receive an initial dose at an earlier stage, giving them some form of protection before the second.

Over the weekend, an internet blockade was in force, only for access to be restored 24 hours later, as demonstrators continued to take to the streets. The crowds reportedly continued to grow Monday, prompting the junta to set curfews from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. and limit gatherings of more than five people, effectively banning the rallies, The Associated Press reports. State media reportedly addressed the protests for the first time Monday by claiming they were endangering the country\'s stability. "Democracy can be destroyed if there is no discipline," the Ministry of Information said in a statement read on television. "We will have to take legal actions to prevent acts that are violating state stability, public safety, and the rule of law." So far, the demonstrations have mostly been peaceful, although there have been reports of police firing rubber bullets and water cannons. Per AP, growth of the protests in Naypyitaw was "particularly ... striking" because it\'s home to many civil servants and their families, which potentially highlights the "level of anger among people" who had experienced democracy over the last few years after decades of military rule.

{'_id': '72ee03c2ebf68819ea9a57e43c71d931', 'title': 'CDC Says Virus Patients Can Be Switched to Another Vaccine for Second Dose', 'description': "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has quietly changed its recommendations for coronavirus immunizations to allow patients to switch the authorized vaccines between the first and second doses in “exceptional situations,” and to extend the interval between doses to six weeks, even though such changes have not been studied in large clinical trials. The new guidelines were posted on the agency’s website Thursday with little public notice. With the possibility of vaccine shortages on the horizon and little expectation that supply can be increased before April, the changes may offer a way to vaccinate more people — a high priority for President Joe Biden, who outlined his national COVID-19 strategy Thursday. A CDC spokeswoman, Kristen Nordlund, said the agency’s “intention is not to suggest people do anything different but provide clinicians with flexibility for exceptional circumstances.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president’s special adviser for COVID-19, has repeatedly advised against delaying the second dose or making any other changes in vaccination protocol without the data to support them. Earlier this month, Britain quietly updated its vaccination playbook to allow for a mix-and-match vaccine regimen if the second dose of the vaccine a patient originally received isn’t available or if the manufacturer of the first shot isn’t known. Some scientists questioned the move at the time, saying Britain was gambling with its new guidance. In the United States, two vaccines have emergency federal authorization — one by Pfizer and BioNTech, and the other by Moderna — and both rely on the same mRNA technology and call for two doses. Until now, the CDC has strictly adhered to the recommendations from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which specifically stated that the vaccines were not to be mixed. The updated CDC guidance still states that the authorized vaccines are “not interchangeable with each other or with other COVID-19 vaccine products.” The agency put the word “not” in bold on its website and noted that the safety and efficacy of mixing doses has not been studied. But “in exceptional situations in which the first-dose vaccine product cannot be determined or is no longer available,” the guidelines added, any available mRNA vaccine can be used for the second dose. With respect to dosing, the guidance says that the second dose should be administered as close as possible to the recommended interval — three weeks for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and four weeks for Moderna. But if that is “not feasible,” the agency wrote, the interval between doses may be extended to six weeks. The pace of vaccination is critical not just to curbing disease and death but also to heading off the effect of more infectious forms of the virus. The CDC has warned that one variant, which is thought to be 50% more contagious, might become the dominant source of infection in the United States by March. Although public health experts are optimistic that the existing vaccines will be effective against that variant, known as B.1.1.7, it may drive up the rate of new cases if enough people remain unvaccinated. At a White House briefing Thursday — his first since November — Fauci said that experts are particularly concerned about new variants of the virus in South Africa and Brazil, which have not yet reached the United States. He said vaccines still appear effective against those variants, but the variants may sidestep the immune system to some degree, making it all the more urgent for people to be vaccinated. “Replicating viruses don’t mutate unless they replicate,” Fauci said, “and if you can suppress that by a very good vaccine campaign, then you can actually avoid this deleterious effect that you might get from the mutations.” Federal health officials and corporate executives agree that it will be impossible to increase the immediate supply of vaccines before April because of lack of manufacturing capacity. And the current vaccination effort, which had little central direction under Donald Trump's administration, has so far sown confusion and frustration. Some localities are complaining they are running out of doses, while others have unused vials sitting on shelves. According to a senior administration official, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are on track to deliver up to 18 million doses a week. Together, they have pledged to deliver 200 million doses by the end of March. A third vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, is due to report the results of its clinical trial shortly. If approved, that vaccine would also help shore up production. If all of that supply were used, the nation could average well over 2 million shots a day. In April and afterward, the outlook brightens. Pfizer and Moderna have each committed to supply another 100 million doses by the end of July; the companies may be able to provide even more. A week ago, Pfizer and BioNTech, its German partner, increased their global production target for the year to 2 billion doses from 1.3 billion doses.

Fellow Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm received a similar conditional green light in December to put its vaccine on the market. Chinese vaccine makers have chequered reputations, after major scandals at home involving expired or poor quality products. Despite being the first to start administering shots, China risks falling behind in the global race to vaccinate against the coronavirus, a process that could take years in the world’s most populous nation.

Since then, 22.8 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been dispensed. But that’s a drop in the bucket for a country of 1.4 billion people.

More than 420,000 Israelis have been infected and 3,325 have died.Israeli officials have not publicized the exact number of vaccine doses that it has received so far, or how much it paid for them, saying the agreements are confidential. But if it turns out that Israel overpaid compared to other countries, Edelstein said, the cost would still be worth it even to reopen the Israeli economy one week earlier than it otherwise could have done.Professor Jonathan Halevy, president of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, said getting in early had been a "correct strategy."With Israel having prioritized health workers and citizens ages 60 and older, Edelstein said that a majority of its high-risk population should receive the second of two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by late January. About 150,000 Israelis are being vaccinated per day.Netanyahu -- who is on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust -- has made the vaccination campaign something of a personal mission, taking credit for signing agreements and securing millions of doses from Pfizer, along with Moderna and other companies.With Israel heading toward another election in March, the country\'s fourth in two years, Netanyahu has made the prospect of a speedy emergence from the health and economic crisis wrought by the pandemic a keystone of his fight for political survival. He has held out the prospect of Israel becoming the first country in the world to be fully vaccinated.Political motives aside, the prime minister has won praise for his efforts even from some longtime critics, after being widely blamed for mishandling the crisis last year."We can\'t blame Netanyahu for all of Israel\'s ills -- correctly, most of the time -- and then ignore his contribution when something works," wrote Gideon Levy, a columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper this week.Netanyahu became the first Israeli to be inoculated against COVID-19 on Dec. 19, saying he wanted to set an example. On Tuesday, he dropped into a Jerusalem facility to congratulate the 500,000th Israeli to receive a vaccine.On Thursday, he visited a vaccination center in the town of Tira, in central Israel, to encourage a higher turnout among the country\'s Arab minority. Arab citizens, who make up one-fifth of the population, have been more hesitant than others to get the vaccine."We brought millions of vaccines here, more than any other country in the world relative to its population," Netanyahu said, adding, "We brought them to everyone: Jews and Arabs, religious and secular.""Come and be vaccinated," he urged in Arabic.Arab representatives say they have been battling a flood of disinformation about the vaccine in the Arabic news and social media. Dr. Samir Subhi, the mayor of Umm al-Fahm, where Netanyahu and Edelstein visited Friday, told Israeli television that he had sent a voice message to 25,000 phones in the area urging people to get vaccinated and describing the fight against the virus as "holy for everyone."Israel\'s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, which has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, was also seen as a population that might resist vaccinations. But those initial fears appear to have dissipated.Rabbi Yitzchok Zilberstein, a leading ultra-Orthodox authority in Jewish law, issued a public ruling after consulting with Balicer saying that any dangers posed by the vaccine were negligible compared with the dangers of the virus. Several important figures in the community were photographed getting the vaccine.So far, the government\'s inoculation campaign has not extended to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, who have not had access to any vaccinations yet, and the Palestinian Authority does not appear to have publicly requested them. Legal experts and human rights activists said Israel was obliged to provide the Palestinians with vaccines.The United Nations humanitarian affairs agency for the occupied territories said this week that the Palestinian Authority had applied for financial support from the global vaccine-sharing system Covax, and was working with international organizations on the logistics.Edelstein said the government\'s first obligation was to its own citizens, but it was in Israel\'s interest to help suppress the infection among the Palestinians. "If, God willing, there will be a situation where we can say we are in a position to help others," he said, "no doubt it will be done."At the headquarters of one of the HMOs in Jerusalem this week, the atmosphere was calm and orderly. A constant stream of people were seated in small booths and injected within a minute or two of their arrival -- much less time than it had taken them to get through on the phone to make the appointment.In Tel Aviv, City Hall and the Sourasky Medical Center said that to meet demand, they were opening a huge vaccination center in the city\'s iconic Rabin Square in the first week of January.Facilities have been accommodating toward younger Israelis who have shown up with older relatives and have sometimes called on the general public to come rather than throw away leftover trays of thawed vaccine that cannot be stored until the next day."We make use of every drop," Sharon Alroy-Preis, a senior Health Ministry official, said on television Thursday.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Aitor Diago/Moment via Getty ImagesThe SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates fast. That’s a concern because these more transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 are now present in the U.S., U.K. and South Africa and other countries, and many people are wondering whether the current vaccines will protect the recipients from the virus. Furthermore, many question whether we will we be able to keep ahead of future variants of SARS-CoV-2, which will certainly arise. In my laboratory I study the molecular structure of RNA viruses – like the one that causes COVID-19 – and how they replicate and multiply in the host. As the virus infects more people and the pandemic spreads, SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. This process of evolution is constant and it allows the virus to sample its environment and select changes that make it grow more efficiently. Thus, it is important to monitor viruses for such new mutations that could make them more deadly, more transmissible or both. People wait for a COVID-19 vaccine during England’s third national lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. Gareth Fuller/PA Images via Getty Images RNA viruses evolve quickly The genetic material of all viruses is encoded in either DNA or RNA; one interesting feature of RNA viruses is that they change much more rapidly than DNA viruses. Every time they make a copy of their genes they make one or a few mistakes. This is expected to occur many times within the body of an individual who is infected with COVID-19. One might think that making a mistake in your genetic information is bad – after all, that’s the basis for genetic diseases in humans. For an RNA virus, a single change in its genome may render it “dead.” That’s not too bad if inside an infected human cell you’re making thousands of copies and a few are no longer useful. However, some genomes may pick up a change that is beneficial for the survival of the virus: Maybe the change allows the virus to evade an antibody – a protein that the immune system produces to catch viruses – or an antiviral drug. Another beneficial change may allow the virus to infect a different type of cell or even a different species of animal. This is likely the pathway that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to move from bats into humans. Any change that gives the virus’s descendants a competitive growth advantage will be favored – “selected” – and begin to outgrow the original parent virus. SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrating this feature now with new variants arising that have enhanced growth properties. Understanding the nature of these changes in the genome will provide scientists with guidance to develop countermeasures. This is the classic cat-and-mouse scenario. In an infected patient there are hundreds of millions of individual virus particles. If you were to go in and pick out one virus at a time in this patient, you would find a range of mutations or variants in the mix. It’s a question of which ones have a growth advantage – that is, which ones can evolve because they are better than the original virus. Those are the ones that are going to become successful during the pandemic. Of the mutations that have been detected, is one of particular concern? Any single variant or change in the virus is probably not that problematic. A single change in the spike protein – which is the region of the virus that attaches to human cells – is probably not going to be a big threat as the medical community rolls out the vaccines. The new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, B.1.1.7., was first identified in the U.K. in December. The red object is a spike protein of the coronavirus, and it interacts with the (blue) ACE2 receptor on the human cell to infect it. The mutations of the new variant are labeled, showing their position on the spike protein. Juan Gaertner/Science Photo Library via Getty Images The current vaccines induce the immune system to produce antibodies that recognize and target the spike protein on the virus, which is essential for invading human cells. Scientists have observed the accumulation of multiple changes in the spike protein in the South African variant. These changes allows SARS-CoV-2, for example, to attach more tightly to the ACE2 receptor and enter human cells more efficiently, according to preliminary unpublished studies. Those alterations could enable the virus to infect cells more easily and enhance its transmissibility. With multiple changes in the spike protein, the vaccines may no longer produce a strong immune response against these new variant viruses. That’s a double whammy: a less effective vaccine and a more robust virus. Right now, the public doesn’t need to be concerned about the current vaccines. The leading vaccine manufacturers are monitoring how well their vaccines control these new variants and are ready to tweak the vaccine design to ensure that they will protect against these emerging variants. Moderna, for example, has stated that it will adjust the second or booster injection to more closely match the sequence of the South African variant. We’ll have to just wait and see, as more people receive vaccinations, whether the transmission rates will drop. Why is lowering transmission key? A drop in transmission rates means fewer infections. Less virus replication leads to fewer opportunities for the virus to evolve in humans. With less opportunity to mutate, the evolution of the virus slows and there is a lower risk of new variants. The medical community needs to make a big push and get as many people vaccinated and thus protected as possible. If not, the virus will continue to grow in large numbers of people and produce new variants. How the new variants are different The U.K. variant, known as B.1.1.7., seems to bind more tightly to the protein receptor called ACE2, which is on the surface of human cells. I don’t think we’ve seen clear evidence that these viruses are more pathogenic, which means more deadly. But they may be transmitted faster or more efficiently. That means that more people will be infected, which translates into more people who will be hospitalized. [Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.] The South African variant, known as 501.V2, has multiple mutations in the gene that encodes the spike protein. These mutations help the virus evade an antibody response. Antibodies have exquisite precision for their target, and if the target changes shape slightly, as with this variant – which virologists call an escape mutant – the antibody can no longer bind tightly, as it loses its power to protect. Why do we need to monitor for mutations? We want to make sure that the diagnostic tests are detecting all of the viruses. If there are mutations in the virus’s genetic material, an antibody or PCR test may not be able to detect it as efficiently or at all. To be sure that the vaccine is going to be effective, researchers need to know if the virus is evolving and escaping the antibodies that were triggered via the vaccine. Another reason that monitoring for new variants is important is that people who’ve been infected might be infected again if the virus has mutated and their immune system can’t recognize it and shut it down. The best way to look for emerging variants in the population is to do random sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses from patient samples across diverse genetic backgrounds and geographical locations. The more sequencing data researchers collect, the better vaccine developers will be able to respond in advance of major changes in the virus population. Many research centers around the U.S. and the world are ramping up their sequencing capabilities to accomplish this.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

{'_id': '09fc5c50cab6ec44d7d7a7852290b14a', 'title': 'Trump Gave WHO a List of Demands. Hours Later, He Walked Away.', 'description': 'GENEVA -- In late May, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, Andrew Bremberg, went on a rescue mission to the World Health Organization headquarters. He told its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that despite weeks of threats that President Donald Trump would quit the health organization, the relationship could still be salvaged.Bremberg hand-delivered a list of seven demands that U.S. officials saw as the beginning of discreet discussions.Hours later, Trump took the lectern outside the White House and blew it all up, announcing that the United States would leave the WHO. The announcement blindsided his own diplomats and Tedros alike.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIf Trump thought Tedros would relent under the pressure of a U.S. withdrawal, he was wrong. The WHO leader has refused to make concessions or counteroffers, according to American and Western officials. And Trump ultimately made good on his promise to abandon a health agency that the United States helped form a half-century ago.With Trump\'s election defeat, President-elect Joe Biden appears ready to rejoin the global health body. But he will inherit a fractured relationship and must quickly make decisions about how to overhaul an organization that even staunch supporters say is in dire need of change.While the Trump administration\'s demands are now moot, they offer a glimpse into both the growing U.S. frustration with the WHO and Trump\'s personal grievances. And as Biden signals a return to multinational diplomacy, the Trump administration\'s demands offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the deal-making of a president who favored aggressive, unpredictable moves over more conventional negotiations.As has often been the case during Trump\'s presidency, his administration was divided, current and former officials said.Diplomats and veteran health officials said the list contained reasonable requests that might have been easily negotiated through normal channels. (The WHO has since made some changes anyway.) But it also contained politically sensitive, if not inappropriate, demands."It doesn\'t seem to reveal a clear strategic vision," said Gian Luca Burci, a former counsel to the health organization who reviewed the list for The New York Times.Experts said it was easy to see why, in the face of Trump\'s withdrawal and his efforts to deflect blame for the pandemic, Tedros chose not to negotiate."It was an enormous backfire, and it was bound to be," added Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and longtime WHO adviser who also reviewed the list. "It wasn\'t a negotiation. It was blackmail."The State Department did not directly address its proposed terms but said it had acted in good faith in calling for needed changes."At a critical moment when the WHO leadership had the opportunity to rebuild trust among some of its critical member states, it chose a path that did the very opposite and demonstrated its lack of independence from the Chinese Communist Party," Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, said in a statement.The WHO did not comment. Several current and former Trump administration officials and Western diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose private conversations.The U.S. list was the product of months of growing irritation with Tedros, whom senior administration officials saw as too quick to praise China or frame the outbreak in ways favorable to Beijing. Tedros, for example, announced in January that China would share biological samples with the world. But he declined to speak up when China never made good on that promise.The WHO had also quietly acquiesced to Beijing\'s conditions before an international mission in February and ceded control of an investigation into the virus\'s origins.Some European health officials and diplomats shared the Trump administration\'s concerns, officials said. But they regarded these as minor issues in the midst of a pandemic.Trump was particularly focused on the issue of travel. The WHO had a long-standing policy of unrestricted travel. As health experts began reconsidering that policy, Trump became preoccupied with getting credit for having halted some travel from China to the United States in February.By April, as Trump toyed with withdrawing the United States from the WHO, two camps emerged in his administration, current and former officials said. The first group, which included Trump\'s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, wanted to leave and rally support for a health agency built around Western allies.Others -- like Bremberg; Alex Azar, the health secretary; and Adam Boehler, head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. -- argued that only the WHO was backed up by a global treaty. If the United States could get the health agency to make changes, they said, it made sense to stay.That argument prevailed into May, and Trump wrote a letter -- which he released on Twitter -- with an ultimatum. He would leave the WHO if it did not "commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days."Exactly what changes Trump sought, however, remained unclear. The final list emerged from discussions between the White House, State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services. In Geneva, Bremberg consulted with European allies, who were eager to keep Trump from abandoning the health organization, Western diplomats said.By late May, the list stood at seven items. The first called for investigations into the WHO\'s handling of the outbreak and the source of the virus. U.S. officials said they saw this as an easy request; more than 140 countries had already endorsed these investigations.In July, Tedros would do just that. He appointed Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia, to lead an investigation into the response to the pandemic. A separate investigation into the virus\'s origins is slowly getting underway.Second, the United States asked Tedros to call on China to provide live virus samples and stop censoring Chinese doctors and journalists. This would have been a significant break for the WHO, which rarely criticizes members. Tedros has told colleagues that he sees no benefit in such criticism, especially during a pandemic.Conceding to the Trump administration\'s demand would have meant allowing one country to dictate the organization\'s posture toward another. But in Washington, one senior White House official recalled this as a key condition, a signal of Tedros\' independence.The third item asked Tedros to say that countries were right to consider travel restrictions during the pandemic -- a break from the long-standing advice that limiting travel would not slow the virus but would harm economies and delay medical treatment.The WHO had already begun to soften that stance by the time Bremberg delivered the list. In April, the organization called for "appropriate and proportionate restrictions" on domestic and international travel.But Tedros interpreted the request as demanding that he apologize to Trump and say the president was right to restrict travel from China, according to public health officials and diplomats who have talked to him. Tedros was wary of being drawn into the U.S. presidential campaign, where travel restrictions were a rallying cry for the Trump campaign.Gostin, who agrees that the WHO should study and revisit its travel guidance, said it was inappropriate for the United States to try to strong-arm the change. He said the list smacked of politics, not good health policy."It was all about my country, my politics, my election," he said.The fourth item on the list called for the WHO to dispatch a team to Taiwan to study its successful pandemic response. Taiwan is not a member of the health organization, and Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its own, exerts tremendous pressure to keep the WHO from engaging with Taiwan\'s government.The U.S. requests also called for the WHO to prequalify coronavirus drugs and vaccines for use around the world once they were authorized by major regulators in the United States, Canada, Europe or Japan. That could help fast-track important treatments, but it could also have been seen as allowing the United States to influence the health organization\'s drug-approval policy.The Trump administration also asked Tedros to ensure that countries like the United States that contribute heavily to the WHO are proportionally represented on the organization\'s staff. And it sought support for proposed changes put forward by the Group of 7 -- the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Canada and Italy. That request is moot, as the G-7 proposal has been folded into larger overhaul efforts.By the time Bremberg and Tedros met in Geneva, however, the political ground had shifted in Washington.Meadows, the White House chief of staff, believed that negotiations with Tedros were a long shot. Even if they succeeded, he argued, they would take too long and yield too little, one senior administration official recalled.Trump had already planned a news conference criticizing China. Shortly before the event, the president\'s national security adviser, Robert O\'Brien, joined Meadows, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Boehler in Meadows\' office in the West Wing, according to the official. From that meeting emerged a plan: Trump would withdraw the country from the WHO.Trump agreed and added the announcement to the news conference. He had done something similar in 2018, announcing that he was quitting a United Nations postal pact, only to reverse himself after winning concessions.Tedros showed no appetite for such deal-making. He told colleagues that he felt boxed in, stuck between China and the United States. Speaking to reporters soon after Trump\'s announcement, Tedros said that U.S. partnership had served humanity for decades."It has made a great difference in public health all around the world," he said. "It is WHO\'s wish for this collaboration to continue."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

With Trump\'s second Senate impeachment trial set to start in just a few hours, Politico reported on Tuesday that his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner have warned the former president "that while he has the votes for acquittal, he can still screw this up." "\'Snatch defeat from the jaws of victory\' is the phrase Kushner has been heard using most frequently to describe the worry," Politico writes. Trump\'s acquittal has been seen as likely after 45 Senate Republicans backed an effort to dismiss the impeachment trial last month, suggesting there aren\'t enough votes for a conviction. In this historic second trial, Trump is facing charges of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol building that left five people dead. His lawyers are expected to argue that the trial isn\'t constitutional because he\'s no longer in office. Trump, Politico also reports, has evidently taken Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump\'s advice to heart, with an aide telling the outlet, "Right now Trump is thinking, \'I\'ve got 45 votes, all I have to do is go golfing and not do anything.\'" But he\'s also "already imagining his comeback," according to the report — and drawing comparisons to his reality show The Apprentice. "He\'s compared it to that time in between seasons of The Apprentice, building anticipation and wonderment for what\'s to come," an adviser told Politico. While it\'s not exactly clear what Trump imagines such a comeback to look like, a separate Politico report on Tuesday said that aides expect him to "gradually" re-emerge once the trial is over, at which point he\'ll likely be "turning his attention toward seeking revenge against Republicans who, he believes, crossed him after he left office."

He vowed to return to Washington, D.C., for President Joe Biden’s inauguration, armed with guns to “embrace” the Second Amendment, according to a criminal complaint.He was scheduled to appear at a detention hearing on Monday afternoon.Proud Boy Charged in Capitol Riot Had USB Full of Bomb-Making Instructions: Docs“You want to say that that was a mob? You want to say that was violence? No sir,” Griffin said in a video posted on the “Cowboys for Trump” Facebook page the day after the insurrection. “No Ma’am. No, we could have a 2nd Amendment rally on those same steps that we had that rally yesterday. You know, and if we do, then it’s gonna be a sad day, because there’s gonna be blood running out of that building. But at the end of the day, you mark my word, we will plant our flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Donald J. Trump if it boils down to it.”Prosecutors warned that Griffin is a danger to the community and should be held without bail due to his history of threatening and racist comments. His lawyers insist Griffin should be released because he simply “got caught up in the crowd” on Jan. 6 and that “he believed he needed to carry firearms to protect himself and his family—not to harm people in Washington, D.C.”In a Friday memo arguing for his pre-trial release, Griffin’s lawyers released several interview transcripts between the FBI and the county commissioner. In those interviews, Griffin revealed his intention to attend a Jan. 20 protest that he hoped would be nonviolent—though he added that “no option that’s off the table for the sake of freedom.”Griffin told FBI agents he’d met the former president twice: once in September 2019 inside the White House and again in Albuquerque. He also attended the inaugural tree lighting at the Capitol in 2018.But Griffin’s relationship with Trump appears to go deeper. In March 2019, Griffin said he had a 30-minute phone conversation with the then-president after he organized a week-long horseback ride from Maryland to the nation’s capital in the name of border security.During the call, Trump welcomed him to the White House that summer, and that meeting appeared to take place in September.Montana Brothers Who Accosted Lone Black Cop During Capitol Riots Are Charged“He said, ‘Couy, that sounds amazing’... ‘If you will do that, then whenever you get here, there’s 20 acres on the South Lawn and the gate will be open to you at the White House where you can ride your horses right in,’” Griffin told the Alamogordo Daily News. “Then he jokingly said that he might have to get on my horse whenever I get there.”In February 2020, Griffin had another audience with Trump in the Oval Office, The Washington Post first reported. Photos of their meeting were posted on the “Cowboys for Trump” Facebook page, which has since been suspended, along with its Twitter account.“These photos are not being used for ‘political purposes,’” he wrote in a Feb. 18 post with images from the meeting. “I am simply posting these pictures of me and a friend. The friend you may recognize. Please don’t copy and paste these photos for ‘political purposes.’ If you do, snowflakes all across the land will begin to melt. But I post them only for personal reasons to show a friendship with a great man and leader!!”The photos show Trump and Griffin sitting and standing together near the Resolute Desk and another of Griffin watching Trump leaving on Marine One from the South Lawn.Three months later, Griffin released a video titled “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat,” in which he insisted he was only speaking theoretically. Trump promoted the controversial video on Twitter, writing, “Thank you, Cowboys. See you in New Mexico!” (Trump’s Twitter account was suspended in January after the Capitol riots.)In an interview with The Daily Beast, Griffin insisted he only meant Democrats who were dead in “the political sense” and suggested Democratic officials who insisted on strict lockdowns amid the coronavirus pandemic should be guilty of treason.“You get to pick your poison: You either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope,” Griffin said.A SoulCycle Influencer Crowed About Getting the Vaccine and All Hell Broke LooseSince his arrest, Griffin has continued his defiant behavior. In a Friday memo, a federal judge revealed that in the two weeks he has been jailed for his role in the riots, he has refused to take a COVID-19 test or appear at a virtual hearing. Griffin, who has been in isolation, could get slapped with contempt charges on Monday if he refuses to appear at his court hearing.“Simply taking a COVID-19 test, something hundreds of millions of people have safely done across the world, will allow the defendant to exit isolation,” U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui wrote Friday.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Can you meet up with old friends? The grandkids? Can you go grocery shopping without fear? To try to clear some things up, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been saying what you should not do after getting your COVID vaccine. Read on—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Dr. Fauci Says Don’t Travel “It is not a good idea to travel period,” Dr. Fauci said at a CNN Town Hall. “I mean, if you absolutely have to travel and it\'s essential, then obviously one would have to do that, but we don\'t want people to think because they got vaccinated, then other public health recommendations just don\'t apply.” He added: “Getting vaccinated does not say now I have a free pass to travel, nor does it say that I have a free pass to put aside all of the public health measures that we talk about all the time.” 2 Dr. Fauci Says Don’t Take Off Your Face Mask “One of the biggest things that are really not well understood as people ask, why should I even have to wear a mask after I get my second shot? And the reason is very clear that the primary endpoint of the vaccine trial was clinically apparent infection. So you could conceivably get infected, get no symptoms and still have virus in your nasal pharynx, which means that you would have to wear a mask to prevent you from infecting someone else, as well as the other side of the coin, where you may not be totally protected yourself,” says Fauci. 3 Dr. Fauci Says Don’t Gather With People—With One Caveat Dr. Fauci says gatherings are still off limits, with one exception: “You can start getting together as individual people, even though the risk is not zero, the risk becomes extremely low when you have both parties vaccinated,” Fauci told CNN Thursday night. “My professional judgment is that when my daughter wants to come in here and she is doubly vaccinated, I’m going to have her over to the house, and I’m going to give her a big hug that I haven’t been able to do for a year,” Fauci said. 4 Dr. Fauci Says When You’ll Have the Most Immunity “You can get some degree of protection, some degree that isn\'t durable, 10 days to 14 days after the first dose, but you can\'t rely on that. The maximum immunity begins about 10 days to two weeks and beyond following the second dose—that goes for anyone, regardless of whether you want to travel or not. That would give you as a group about a 94 to 95% efficacy and a good safety profile.” RELATED: Dr. Fauci Just Said When We\'d Get Back to Normal 5 Dr. Fauci Says the CDC Will Announce New Rules Soon Fauci said it was “common sense” that some relaxation on rules for those already vaccinated would be announced by the CDC—and it could be soon. "If I\'m fully vaccinated, and my daughter comes in the house, and she\'s fully vaccinated, do we really need to have the stringent public-health measure that we would if it was a stranger who was not vaccinated?" he said on CNN. Until then, don’t travel, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Michael Clevenger/Getty ImagesAs the COVID-19 vaccines reach more people across the country, some people have asked: Could we delay the second dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to allow more people to be vaccinated more quickly? And, how safe am I after my first dose? As an immunologist, I hear this question frequently. The answer is that a single dose is very effective – but I would add that you should still get both doses. The issue is important, however, not only for your personal health but also for the country’s health as leaders figure out how to ensure there’s enough vaccine for everyone who wants one. Medical workers vaccinate medical staff members against COVID-19 on Dec. 20, 2020, in Tel Aviv. Amir Levy/Getty Images Good news from abroad A recent study in Israel showed that a single dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective, up to 85%. The Sheba Medical Center reported its experience with vaccinating its nearly 10,000 staff members with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination there started Dec. 19, 2020, which coincided with the third wave of COVID-19 in Israel. The researchers looked to see the rate of reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease after vaccination. By Jan. 24, 2021, 7,214 health care workers there had received a first dose, and 6,037 had received the second dose. Altogether, there were 170 cases of infection between Dec. 19, 2020, and Jan. 24, 2021. Of those, 89 people, or 52%, were unvaccinated; 78 people, or 46%, tested positive after the first dose; and three, or 2%, tested positive after the second dose. This is consistent with a reanalysis of the phase 3 clinical trial data reported in 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In that study, the 52% protection from the first dose included infections that occurred in the first 10 days after vaccination, when one would not expect the vaccine to have had time to generate protective anti-spike antibodies. Using the data from the published study of the Pfizer vaccine, Public Health England determined that vaccine efficacy was 89% for 15-21 days after dose 1 – and before dose 2 on day 21. The range was between 52% and 97%. For days 15-28, or up to the first week after the second dose, protection from the first dose was estimated at 91%. The range for this was between 74% and 97%. A second dose would not be expected to confer immunity within that time. Bottom line So what do we know? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges people to get both doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. You should be reassured that even after a single dose of either of those vaccines, you have very high levels of protection after your body has time to build immunity, about a week. The scheduled second dose of these vaccines makes them even more effective, but at a time where vaccine supplies are limited, there’s a lot to be said about prioritizing the first dose for the most people.

Top of mind for many is, can you still take your medications? Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke with CBSN about just that during a Q+A session. “Patients often ask me whether they should be taking pain relievers either before or after the vaccine shot,” asked a healthcare worker. “I've heard mixed advice. What do you think?” Read on for his answer, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Dr. Fauci Says Do Not Take A Drug That “Supresses an Immunological Response” As for taking medicines after the vaccine, Fauci says “the mixed advice is based on the fact that there's very little data on that. I mean, if you're going to take something that suppresses an immunological response, then obviously you don't want to take something like that, except if you're taking it for an underlying disease.” Immunosuppressants are “medications that suppress the body’s immune system,” according to Johns Hopkins. “These are usually taken after an organ transplant to prevent the body from ‘rejecting’ the transplanted organ.” Keep reading to see what he thinks you can take. 2 Dr. Fauci Says Some Tylenol After the Vaccine Should be OK Aches and pains are a common side effect of the COVID vaccine. “If someone gets achy or gets a headache and it's really bothering you, I mean, I would believe as a physician that I would have no trouble taking a couple of Tylenol for that,” he said. “So again, people are going to come back and forth and say, well, it could mute or dampen the immunological response to the vaccine itself. I don't see any biological mechanisms why something like Tylenol would not do that.” 3 Dr. Fauci Said He Didn’t Think Anti-Inflammatories Would Be a Problem, but Is Unsure “There's the hypothetical theoretical. That's the better word,” he continued. “That may be something that's a true, anti-inflammatory such as one of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories should not be given, but I don't think that's going to be a major thing.”RELATED: If You Feel This You May Have Already Had COVID Says Dr. Fauci 4 Dr. Fauci Said Do Expect Some Side Effects, Especially After the Second Dose “If you are really having discomfort that usually would occur rarely after the first dose, you likely would get a pain in the arm and maybe a little bit of an ache, not very much of an issue there. That's what I went through personally, when I got it,” he said. “But the second dose of either the Madonna or the Pfizer in some people do get about a 24 hours worth of achiness, maybe some chills, occasionally a fever, a headache. You feel under the weather, as it were taking something appealed to you—like two Tylenol, every six or eight hours or so—I can see is going to have a major difference that might make you feel much better.” 5 How to Stay Safe Before and After Vaccination Follow Fauci’s fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live—wear a face mask that fits snugly and is double layered, don’t travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'a5ee05adc1917045ba81450e5dba57e5', 'title': 'People infected by Covid should wait six months for vaccination, says Spanish government', 'description': 'Spain’s government has ordered individuals who have been infected with the virus to wait for six months before being vaccinated, based on growing evidence that antibodies developed in response to Covid offer long-lasting immunity. In its updated vaccination strategy, due to be presented to the country’s regional authorities on Wednesday, Spain’s health ministry said cases of reinfection were “exceptional”, and recommended that those who have had Covid be put at the back of the queue. The instructions currently apply to key workers 55 or younger, the next priority group to be included in Spain’s vaccination campaign and who are set to be given AstraZeneca jabs. Spain is thought to be among the first countries to impose such a policy. “The number of documented cases from reinfection is very low in the first six months after infection,” explained the new vaccination strategy document. Spain’s health ministry decided last week that the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be administered to people older than 55 due to a lack of clinical data on the drug’s effect on older people. For key workers and people from other risk groups of 56 and over, the plan is to vaccinate them whether they have had a Covid infection or not. Results from a study by Public Health England released in January suggested that the protection from reinfection from Covid created by naturally occurring antibodies was between 83 and 99 per cent. The results were based on two probable and 42 possible cases of reinfection among health workers within five months of testing positive. The Spanish government’s decision is in line with the advice from several public health organisations, including the national immunological society, who have called for a gap of up to eight months between a person being infected and having a Covid vaccine. “We must prioritise and advance at the highest speed possible, optimising each dose received to ensure it reaches the citizens who need it most,” the letter addressed to Spain’s health ministry says. The WHO also says that people who have had Covid-19 can wait six months before being vaccinated. As of Monday, Spain had administered 2.17 million doses - mostly of the Pfizer vaccine - with 839,000 people having received their second jab. According to the government’s new strategy, under-55s who test positive for Covid after having their first dose should also wait six months before their second jab. A recent study found that those who have already been infected with the virus had a far higher antibody response following vaccination than those who had not been infected and may only need one jab.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Ignacio Aguado, Madrid’s deputy president, said that the region’s health authority had received fewer vaccines than initially promised by the Spanish government, and claimed that the decision to reserve some of the first supplies from the end of December and early January was now vindicated. “We will focus on delivering the second doses, which are so necessary,” Mr Aguado said. Spain’s health ministry has marked out the strategy for regions to implement, with elderly care home residents and health workers the first risk groups to be vaccinated, and all other over-80s next on the list. Regions are assigned a proportion of the vaccines imported by Spain according to the needs of their population, but the Spanish government recalculated those numbers partly based on the regions’ different speed of use when Pfizer’s delivery batch was less than expected last week. Madrid complained that it received only half of the scheduled 48,750 doses on January 18, forcing it to re-examine its strategy. Madrid has used just under 170,000 doses, but only 4,000 have been second shots. Faced with a similar problem, the region of Catalonia has taken a different approach and opted to delay the second dose for around 10,000 people beyond the three-week time lag recommended by Pfizer. Catalonia’s health department noted that the European Medicines Agency based its approval of the Pfizer vaccine on the results of trials in which the time between doses ranged between 19 and 42 days. Nationwide, just under 1.3 million doses have been administered in Spain in a month. Given that the population stands at 47 million, the objective of reaching 70 per cent vaccination by the end of the summer remains a tall order.', 'num_of_covid': 1}
{'_id': 'dd354c6e13154c89603fbb97641c5934', 'title': "Sure Signs You're Contagious With COVID, Says Dr. Fauci", 'description': 'COVID-19 is spreading rampantly around the country, with the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths reaching record-breaking highs. As we enter into the holiday season, it is becoming increasingly more important to slow the spread of the virus. Obviously, one of the key ways that people can do this is by quarantining if they are infected — especially if they are contagious. But how do you know if you are capable of spreading the virus to others? During a talk with CNN\'s Dr. Sanjay Gupta during "COVID-19: Chasing Science to Save Lives," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading infectious disease expert explained one way to figure out if you are contagious with COVID — even if you are asymptomatic. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.\xa0Dr. Fauci Says it All Comes Down to TestingAccording to Dr. Fauci, it all comes down to testing, and more specifically, the type of testing you undergo. "I think that our listeners and viewers need to understand that there are tests for different purposes."The first type, PCR tests are more sensitive and therefore more accurate.\xa0"If you\'ve been exposed — either symptomatic or not — expensive PCR tests that you can\'t get in 10 or 15 minutes, it\'s going to get at best a day and sometimes two and three days," he explained.\xa0Then, there are the less sensitive, less accurate antigen tests, which are a great way to "get a feel for what the penetrance of infection is in a particular group" — such "as a college, in a factory, in a nursing home" — even when nobody is experiencing symptoms. "If you get tested two or three times a week, the lack of sensitivity of that test will be made up for, by the frequency with which you get it," he explained.\xa0This second group of tests, the antigen, are also a good determinant of whether or not you are contagious. Basically, if your level of virus is so low that the test doesn\'t pick it up, you probably aren\'t going to spread it to anyone else.\xa0"Even though the sensitivity might be lower in the antigen test that\'s more of a screening test, if you wind up getting a level of virus that is not picked up by the antigen test, because it\'s so low, you could be infected, but your virus is so low that you are not infective," he explained. "You\'re not going to transmit it because it\'s not picked up by the antigen test.""I think that\'s something we\'re learning more and more about the more information we get, the more confident we\'ll be as to whether or not these tests can be used on a basis of screening to tell you, at least I\'m not infective to someone else," he concluded.\xa0RELATED: 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say DoctorsHow to Stay Healthy During the PandemicAs for yourself, do everything you can to prevent getting—and spreading—COVID-19 in the first place, since the vaccine isn\'t here yet: Wear a face mask, get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don\'t miss these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'fdde72cab0c7d969d9c499c5e2ea011d', 'title': 'Stop Doing This Immediately, Dr. Fauci Says', 'description': 'There has been good news about vaccines recently—in the last week, Johnson&Johnson has announced that its potential vaccine is more than 70% effective—but that doesn\'t mean Americans should let down their guard and resume old habits, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading infectious disease expert, last week. One activity that should be avoided: Travel, which Fauci said was "not a good idea… period." Read on for more of his warning—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. 1 You Do Not Have a "Free Pass" to Travel After Getting Vaccinated "Getting vaccinated does not say you have a free pass to travel," Fauci said on a CNN town hall about COVID-19. "Nor does it say you have a free pass to put aside all the public health measures that we talk about all the time."The two current vaccines—produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—require two doses taken three weeks apart. "You can get some degree of protection that isn\'t durable 10 days to 14 days after the first dose, but you can\'t rely on that," said Fauci. "The maximum immunity begins about 10 days to two weeks and beyond following the second dose. That goes for anyone, regardless of whether you want to travel or not." Keep reading to see how you can get infected even after getting vaccinated. 2 You Don\'t Have 100% Protection With a Vaccine Fauci pointed out that even after you get maximum immunity from two doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, protection isn\'t complete. "That would give you, as a group, about a 94% to 95% efficacy and a good safety profile," he said. That means the vaccines do what they\'re intended to do: Prevent severe illness from COVID-19. It\'s not clear if they prevent infection with coronavirus or transmission to other people. "You could conceivably get infected, get no symptoms and still have virus in your nasal pharynx, which means that you would have to wear a mask to prevent you from infecting someone else, as well as the other side of the coin, where you may not be totally protected yourself," explained Fauci."It is not a good idea to travel, period," he added. "If you absolutely have to travel and it\'s essential, then obviously one would have to do that. But we don\'t want people to think that because they got vaccinated that other public health recommendations just don\'t apply." 3 The CDC Chief Agrees With Dr. Fauci: Don\'t Travel There is no better time to cancel your travel plans. "Now is not the time to travel," new CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, asserted last week. "But if you must, be safe and follow the CDC guidelines." This includes wearing a mask as well as testing and quarantining protocol. 4 The CDC Just Issued a Mask Mandate in All Transportation Hubs The CDC just issued a mask mandate in all transportation hubs, which includes "airport, bus terminal, marina, seaport or other port, subway station, terminal, train station, U.S. port of entry or any other location that provides transportation." "Conveyance operators must use best efforts to ensure that any person on the conveyance wears a mask when boarding, disembarking and for the duration of travel," the document said. 5 How to Get Through This Pandemic Healthy As for yourself, do everything you can to prevent getting—and spreading—COVID-19 in the first place: Wear a face mask, get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don\'t miss these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

That&#39;s more than twice the number of fatalities in India, the country reporting the second-highest number of cases in the world.               And as the U.S. crosses that milestone - losing on average 800 people a day to virus - the pandemic here is not localized in one or two epicenters: it&#39;s smoldering across the nation.

Regrets, No.', 'description': 'Two and a half hours after being injected with a COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Taneisha Wilson was hit with the worst headache of her life.In her home office in Cranston, Rhode Island, Wilson, 38, an emergency physician with a constitution she calls "horse-like," laid her head down on the desk. Fighting a wave of nausea, she let out an involuntary groan loud enough to be heard by her husband in a room down the hall."Are you OK, babe?" he called.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"It felt like I got smacked," Wilson recalled in an interview.That is not how most people who get the vaccine feel afterward, but reactions like Wilson\'s were not uncommon in the clinical trial results of the two COVID vaccines now being distributed across the country. Pfizer, the company that makes the one she received, reported that some 13% of recipients ages 18 to 55 had a bad headache after the first dose. About 16% of those who received the other vaccine, made by Moderna, in a late-stage trial had a reaction strong enough to prevent them from going about their daily routine.As tens of millions of Americans await their turn for a shot, many are hungering for details about what to expect. So, at the request of friends, colleagues and reporters, some people like Wilson who were in the vanguard of the biggest vaccination program in U.S. history are beginning to offer their personal accounts.The New York Times interviewed several dozen of the newly vaccinated in the days afterward. They recounted a wide spectrum of responses, from no reaction at all -- "Can\'t even tell I had the shot," said a hospital worker in Iowa City, Iowa -- to symptoms like uncontrolled shivering and "brain fog." A nurse assistant in Glendora, California, wondered whether the fever he ran was a side effect of the vaccine or a sign that he had been infected by one of his COVID patients.And there was a dizzying variety of sore arms. Some likened the pain to that from a flu shot; for others, it was considerably worse.Like nearly every vaccine recipient who spoke to The Times for this article, Wilson stressed that she had no regrets about getting the shot, despite the headache, which was gone within 36 hours. The Food and Drug Administration has found the vaccines to be safe and remarkably effective. And public health leaders say mass vaccination is the only hope for controlling the virus that is now claiming the lives of close to 3,000 Americans a day.But in these first weeks of vaccination, there is an inescapable element of suspense.Along with a card reminding them when to get the necessary second dose, vaccine recipients are handed information on how to report side effects to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an app called V-Safe.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both rely on a genetic technology that has never before yielded a vaccine that won regulatory approval. They are authorized for emergency use only. Studies of their safety, including the cases of an Alaska health care worker and a Boston doctor who experienced severe allergic reactions after receiving their shots, are still underway.And as Wilson crawled into bed at 10:30 on a weekday morning, she could not help but be "hyper-aware," she said, "that I had just been vaccinated with this novel vaccine."Navigating a Brain FogAs vaccines go, experts have agreed, the two being distributed now elicit more reactions than most.At the Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown, West Virginia, Betty Shannon, 81, said some fellow residents had an upset stomach after becoming some of the nation\'s first seniors to receive a COVID vaccine.Lorenzo Alfonso, 34, a nurse assistant in California, was unusually tired and achy.Delayna Frint, a nurse in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, said her arm was so sore after the shot that in order to hang intravenous therapy bags, she had to lower the stands.But for infectious disease experts, a nation down for the count with post-vaccine malaise would be the best news in a long time. The side effects dissipate within a few days, and they are a signal, the experts say, that the vaccine is working."We call them \'side\' effects, but it\'s really just an effect," said Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania vaccinologist who is a member of the FDA\'s vaccine advisory panel. "This is what your immune response does when it\'s responding to an infection."The vaccines each work by prompting the body to make a particular protein that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells; neither exposes the recipient to the virus itself. The presence of that protein in the body sets off the production of new antibodies that can destroy the protein -- the key to providing protection against a future invasion of the actual virus. But the process also releases substances that can cause inflammation, which can result in fever, fatigue, headache and other symptoms.Many more participants in the vaccine trials registered discomfort after the second dose, given three or four weeks later, than after the first. That is probably because by that time, the body is already primed to attack the protein, experts said.Most of the reactions experienced by the 1.9 million Americans who received a vaccine this month had already been seen among the roughly 35,000 people who were vaccinated in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials. But experts expect new ones to appear: "If it\'s a one-in-a-million thing, you need a million to see even one," said Dr. Peter Doshi, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.Some may be mild allergic reactions, like the "body-wide itching" and "mild, small hives along forearm" that Dr. Megan Hajjar of Farmington, Connecticut, described in a Facebook post with a video clip. Or they may be more severe, like the handful of cases of anaphylaxis that the CDC has already identified.And others may simply be more intense versions of what the trials called "fatigue." Alyson MacGregor, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University and an accomplished home chef, said she spent the day after her vaccination in a mental fog that turned her attempt at the most basic of meals into an inedible blob."I can\'t believe I messed up ramen," she told her husband that night.She felt, she said, as if "there was a cloud over me, following me around."Debating DisclosureThe first several million doses of both vaccines are earmarked for health care workers and for nursing home residents who are at elevated risk of dying from COVID-19 if they become infected.Public health leaders have estimated that more than 200 million Americans will need to be vaccinated to effectively prevent the virus from spreading. In polls, a substantial fraction have expressed hesitancy about receiving COVID vaccinations. And some front-line health workers have wrestled with whether discussing their own side effects might deter others from getting vaccinated."I do worry -- is it going to encourage someone to have second thoughts?" said Dr. Matthew Harris, 38, an emergency medicine doctor in Great Neck, New York.Harris was up all night with a fever, shivering underneath a blanket, after receiving the first shot. He had joint pain in his wrists and shoulders that lasted into the next day.But he had already published a post on Facebook about receiving his shot. It had been an especially emotional moment for him, nine months to the day after he was hospitalized with a severe case of COVID and did not know whether he would survive to see his wife and two young children again."Please," one nonmedical friend commented on his vaccination post, "let us know what the experience is like!!!"So the next day, he posted about his reaction, with the hashtag stillworthit."Everyone has read, \'This is the light at the end of the tunnel,\'" Harris said in an interview. "But are people going to feel great 100% of the time after this vaccine? No. And if we\'re not honest with them, how can we expect them to trust us?"Dr. Sylvia Owusu-Ansah, an emergency physician in Pittsburgh, has also opted to chronicle her vaccine side effects on Facebook. She is African American, and at the livestreamed inoculation earlier this month, she told reporters that she "wanted to share with my community that it is OK." Distrust of the vaccine is particularly high among Black Americans, because of a history of mistreatment of Black people by the medical establishment.In the name of transparency, Owusu-Ansah recorded "mild muscle aches and pains with left arm soreness" on day one and "nasal congestion, mild headache" on days three through five -- pointedly beginning her posts with "I AM STILL HERE!"Another DoseForty-eight hours after Wilson\'s post-vaccine headache sent her to bed, she returned to her job in the emergency room at a hospital. Like many hospitals around the nation, its intensive care unit was crowded with COVID cases. On one recent shift, Wilson said, there were 12 patients in the critical care bay and only one bed available in the ICU to take them."These are people having strokes, myocardial infarction that need catheterization," she recalled. "You have to understand the reality."That time, Wilson said, it wasn\'t a vaccine side effect that made her feel as if she was going to throw up.She is scheduled for her second dose of the vaccine next month.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech won a critical endorsement Thursday from an FDA panel of outside advisers, and signoff from the agency, which is expected within days, is the next step needed to get the shots to the public. The FDA is not required to follow the guidance of its advisory committees, but often does. Mark Meadows, White House chief of staff, spoke to Dr Hahn by telephone on Friday, a senior administration official who was familiar with the conversation told AP. The chief of staff also told Dr Hahn his job was in jeopardy if the emergency use authorisation was not issued before Saturday, said a second administration official familiar with the conversation. Dr Hahn signaled that he would tell regulators to allow the vaccine to be issued on an emergency basis, the official said. President Donald Trump has been pressing for quick approval for the vaccine and tweeted directly at Dr Hahn earlier Friday, complaining that FDA "is still a big, old, slow turtle." Trump has publicly bashed the pace of the FDA\'s vaccine review process. "Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn," Mr Trump tweeted Friday. "Stop playing games and start saving lives." Dr Hahn disputed the characterisations of his conversation with Mr Meadows. "This is an untrue representation of the phone call with the Chief of Staff," Dr Hahn said in a statement. "The FDA was encouraged to continue working expeditiously on Pfizer-BioNTech\'s EUA request. FDA is committed to issuing this authorization quickly, as we noted in our statement this morning." The FDA said earlier Friday that it "will rapidly work" to grant emergency use of the vaccine.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '38dc1a956dcfbe36e476f81a2176263e', 'title': 'A Dying Teacher, Worrying Over Students to His Last Breaths', 'description': 'Erick Ortiz lay in a hospital bed just before Thanksgiving, struggling to breathe. Unable to see his family, he texted his wife, concerned about his high school chemistry students: “Have they assigned a sub for my classes?” Four days later, he was put on a ventilator. He would never recover. Ortiz’s death last month after testing positive for the coronavirus devastated his family and colleagues at Charles H. Milby High School, which serves one of Houston’s poorest neighborhoods, and heightened concern among educators throughout the city about in-person teaching during the pandemic. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “I don’t want this to ever happen to another teacher,” said Maria Ortiz, Erick Ortiz’s widow, who retired from teaching in 2019. “They have to be protected as well.” There is no indication that teachers are dying at a higher rate than other professionals, and no evidence that the coronavirus is spreading faster in schools than in communities at large, especially in districts where health precautions are strictly followed. Federal researchers said Tuesday that they had found “little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission” in places that take safety seriously. But the special role that teachers play in their communities, through their connection with children and families, and the concern among educators about the safety of in-person teaching has made the losses especially painful and disruptive in many places. “There are educators that are dying and have died from this,” said Daniel Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, which represents 9,000 superintendents across the country. “When that happens, that makes the situation even harder to try to convince others to move ahead.” Though there is no definitive account of how many of the nation’s 3.5 million teachers have died during the pandemic, the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation’s largest teachers’ unions, said it was aware of 530 school employees lost to COVID-19 last year. The Houston Independent School District, like many across the country, said that it had taken the kind of steps recommended by public health officials, including a mask mandate, social distancing and Plexiglas barriers in classrooms. But many educators said those rules were not strictly enforced, and the precautions were inadequate or unevenly applied. Domenech said school superintendents find themselves trying to balance teacher safety concerns with the need for in-person learning, to combat the many inequities of remote schooling. “They will always be under fire from the teachers who feel that they’re being forced to go into a situation that they don’t think is safe,” he said, “and from parents who either want their kids in or out.” Educators lost to the virus in recent weeks include a married couple who taught at public schools in Grand Prairie, Texas, and died within hours of each other; an art teacher in Fayetteville, North Carolina, whose students left her personal messages on a memorial outside the school; and a gym teacher and coach in Lincoln County, North Carolina, whose family hung a Nerf basketball hoop off the TV in his hospital room to try to distract him as he lay dying. The lack of contact tracing in most of the country, as well as the rapid spread of the virus throughout much of the United States in recent months, makes it nearly impossible to know where most of those teachers contracted the virus. But their deaths have still contributed to the heated debates in communities over school safety. The death of Patrick Key, an elementary schoolteacher in Powder Springs, Georgia, who lost a monthlong battle with COVID-19 on Christmas morning, intensified pressure to halt in-person learning in Cobb County’s school district. After two other district teachers died last week, more than a hundred educators showed up for a protest ahead of a school board meeting. Two board members and the superintendent declined a request to wear masks during a moment of silence to honor Key, whose obituary asked that in lieu of sending flowers for his funeral, people buy and wear face coverings. In Montgomery, Alabama, the deaths of at least four school employees who had been battling the virus have added to the sense of alarm. The most recent was a 49-year-old music teacher. On Monday, the superintendent announced that Montgomery schools would move to remote classes and most likely resume in-person instruction only once vaccines are available for the district’s 4,500 employees. Some states have prioritized educators for vaccinations, but not all. And even in places where teachers are near the front of the line, officials say it could take months to vaccinate everyone who works in schools. Even then, many teachers remain concerned about returning to classrooms as new, apparently more contagious variants arise. Ortiz’s death in December had a galvanizing effect on educators in Houston. The following week, teachers at about 50 schools in Harris County participated in a nationwide sickout to demand a safer learning environment during the pandemic. “He could have been me,” said Traci Latson, 50, a teacher at Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School, who described in-person instruction in Houston as “Russian roulette.” Ortiz’s death prompted her to get her will and financial affairs in order, she said. “Every day that I step on campus,” Latson said, “I’m not quite sure if it’s my last day.” Under Texas law, teachers and their unions lack collective bargaining power, unlike in many Northern states, where some teachers and their unions have resisted returning to classrooms because of concerns about their safety. In Chicago, tensions over reopening plans have escalated to the point where the district told parents not to send their children to school on Wednesday because teachers there refused to come to work in person and may strike. Public health experts have largely come to agree that schools, particularly elementary schools, are unlikely to seed transmission of the virus when community spread is low — provided those schools use mitigation strategies. That thinking was bolstered again Tuesday by a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which looked at 17 schools in rural Wisconsin where mask wearing was common; it found that of 191 infections among staff members and students during the fall, seven resulted from in-school transmission. In Houston, which like all Texas school districts was required by the state to offer an in-person teaching option last fall, the school system has a mask mandate and requires 6 feet of social distancing “whenever possible.” A district spokesperson said it also set up daily temperature checks at school entrances, plexiglass dividers in classrooms and nasal swab testing on campus — though several teachers disputed the ubiquity of those practices. One teacher provided pictures of what she considered the inadequate dividers in her classroom — there are two, one for her desk, and a second one that can be moved between student desks — while others said there was no routine testing in their particular schools, despite district policy, and that they knew of students who had coronavirus cases in their families, and even deaths, but came to school with symptoms anyway. The Houston school district is the nation’s seventh largest, with about 200,000 students and more than 27,000 employees. As of Monday, it had reported 2,181 confirmed coronavirus cases during the pandemic, including 1,199 among staff members, or about 4% of employees. Ortiz, a 52-year-old father of three who had diabetes, was wary about returning to the classroom, his wife said. A lover of science, he studied biology in college and worked in a lab before becoming a high school teacher in 1997, a career shift inspired by his wife. “I kind of talked him into it because I loved it, and he ended up loving it, too,” Maria Ortiz said. Her husband wore a plastic face shield and a mask in his chemistry classes after schools opened in October. Ortiz said she believed he became infected with the virus later that month while proctoring the SAT for five hours, in a classroom with about 20 students. She recalled him mentioning that some of the students were coughing during the test. About a week later, he came home feeling under the weather, she said, and tested positive for the virus. For the next week, he stayed behind the closed door of their bedroom, ill with a fever that hit 104 degrees and an increasingly severe cough. Early on Nov. 16, Maria Ortiz went to check on him, she said, and found he could not speak. She called an ambulance. “They didn’t even tell me what his oxygen was; they just said it’s really low, we need to take him to the hospital,” she recalled. “He never came out.” In an email, the Houston school system said that it had been “deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our beloved Milby High School teachers,” but said the district “remains focused on providing our students with a high-quality education while ensuring that the health, safety and well-being of both our students and staff are held to the highest standard.” For Ortiz and her children, the loss has been devastating. “Dad was everything to them,” she said. She also received messages from some of her husband’s former students, including letters that were delivered to the funeral home. “He was one of the most caring and hardworking people I’ve met,” one student wrote. Her grief is mixed with anger, because she believes the welfare of her husband and his colleagues was not prioritized. “Teachers are also on the front lines educating children, trying to get them ahead, during this pandemic,” Ortiz said. “And they’re not being treated with respect.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'ae6ec7447974ee4961cccb001a799cd6', 'title': 'Racial Divide in Reopened Classrooms: More White Than Black Children', 'description': 'NEW YORK -- Mayor Bill de Blasio\'s monthslong effort to reopen New York City classrooms was complicated by major logistical challenges, staunch political resistance and a series of crises that culminated in a brief systemwide shutdown last month. At every turn, de Blasio insisted that the city\'s most vulnerable children needed open schools.But as some school buildings reopen this week, the mayor has found himself presiding over a starkly unequal school system in which many white families have flocked back to classrooms while most families of color have chosen to learn from home indefinitely.That gulf is illustrated in a startling statistic: There are nearly 12,000 more white children returning to public school buildings than Black students -- even though there are many more Black students than white children in the system overall.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIn New York and across the country, politicians and education officials have found that many nonwhite families are not ready to send their children back to classrooms -- despite their struggles with remote learning -- in part because of the disproportionately harsh impact the virus has had on their communities.But the fact that so many students of color have chosen remote over in-person learning is raising alarms that existing disparities in the nation\'s largest school system will widen, since remote learning has been far less effective, parents, educators and officials said in dozens of interviews. More than ever, they say, the city must quickly bolster online instruction -- or risk having its neediest children fall irrevocably behind."It\'s the perfect storm of marginalization," said Jamila Newman of TNTP, a nonprofit that provides consulting services for districts on staffing and instruction. "That\'s why there is the need to demand stronger instruction remotely."New York\'s issues with remote instruction begin with a lack of basic infrastructure for students learning from home. Many low-income students, including some living in homeless shelters, cannot even log on for classes because they still do not have devices or Wi-Fi.Educators also said they were scrambling to make lessons more engaging for students without much helpful guidance from the city. So while individual teachers and schools have honed creative strategies to improve online instruction, there is no clear citywide plan to do the same, leaving a patchwork system of learning across the city\'s 1,800 schools.De Blasio has acknowledged that his administration spent much of its time and resources focused on physically reopening classrooms, rather than on improving remote learning, precisely because it understood that in-person learning is generally superior.But the shortcomings of that strategy are now becoming clear in the demographic breakdown of the roughly 190,000 children returning to classrooms this week.Of the roughly 1 million students who attend traditional public schools, about 700,000 have chosen to learn from home, and another 110,000 middle and high school students who signed up for in-person classes but cannot yet return to school buildings.Latino students make up the largest share of students returning to classrooms, about 43%, roughly proportional to their overall representation in the school system. But white children, who are less likely to be low income than many of their peers, make up a quarter of students back in classrooms, even though they represent just 16% of overall enrollment, the smallest percentage of any racial group.Black and Asian American families are significantly underrepresented in reopened classrooms. Just under 18% of Black families have chosen to send their children back to school, though those students make up nearly a quarter of the system. Asian American children, who represent about 18% of the overall school system, make up the smallest share of children in classrooms this week, at just under 12%.Still, about three-quarters of children returning to schools are nonwhite, in part because the system is overwhelmingly Black and Latino.There is no one reason the numbers are so skewed. Families of all racial and ethnic groups in New York have decided to return to classrooms or stay home based on individual circumstances. But the data and interviews with parents show that Black and Asian American families in particular did not trust the city to keep their children safe."Clearly, there are Black families who are hesitant, which only makes sense after the disparities they experienced during the heights of the pandemic," Bill Neidhardt, the mayor\'s press secretary, said in a statement. "And that\'s exactly why our vaccine response will focus on equity and engaging the hardest-hit communities, so we can get our schools fully back once and for all."Experts and advocates said more nonwhite students might have chosen to attend classes in person if the city had done a better job of outreach.In some cases, just the opposite happened: Even while de Blasio was trumpeting open classrooms, some schools were asking every family that was able to stay at home to do so, in order to ease staffing and scheduling burdens.But those who chose online learning said they needed more support from the Department of Education."I feel like the city treats remote like an afterthought," said Erika Kendall, a Black parent in Brooklyn whose two children decided to learn from home this year.About 60,000 students learning remotely still had not received the devices they requested as of a few weeks ago, which has spurred some parents to crowdfund laptops for children who need them. The Legal Aid Society recently sued the city for not providing Wi-Fi in all city shelters so that children can attend school remotely.City officials said they would distribute devices to all children who need them in the coming weeks and noted that they have given iPads with data from multiple service providers to some children living in shelters.Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, pointed to resources the city had provided to improve remote learning: for example, expanded technical support for teachers and families and more training for educators, including a master class for using Google Classroom and more help from remote learning specialists."We have transformed the nation\'s largest school system in a matter of months, and we\'ve never strayed from our commitment and focus on making remote learning the strongest it could be," she said in a statement. "In a system as large as ours, educators come into teaching with varying skills, and there can never be a one-size-fits-all approach."Still, many families said the city\'s efforts have been seriously lacking, particularly for the children who struggle most with remote learning.Jenn Choi, a parent and activist for children with disabilities, said a recent survey she helped conduct of over 1,000 city parents of children with special needs left her extremely discouraged about the quality of pandemic-era schooling. "Instruction has been spread so thin to the point where it can\'t even count as special education instruction," she said.De Blasio has continued to defend his focus on reopening classrooms."We\'ve always said from the beginning that nothing is as good as in-person education," the mayor said at a recent news conference, adding that he believes a vaccine will be more widely distributed in the spring, allowing more students to return to school. On Monday, the mayor said his team is working on a plan to address learning loss for whenever all students are back in school full time.The demographics of the pandemic-era school system do not resemble what the mayor hoped and expected. But entrenched inequities in New York City\'s public schools far precede his administration or the pandemic. And the mayor\'s effort to reopen schools for as many children as possible is one of the most ambitious initiatives undertaken by any mayor in years.The city has faced particular challenges because of its vast size and the spotlight that has been fixed on it. The second- and third-largest school districts, Los Angeles and Chicago, still have not attempted to reopen their public schools.The scale of need among the city\'s public school students is also unmatched anywhere else in the country, making reopening even more challenging: The vast majority of New York City students are low income and nonwhite, and the city is home to about 111,000 homeless students as well as 200,000 children with disabilities.City officials described a series of conversations over the summer in which they tried to determine if one vulnerable group or another should get priority for classroom instruction, but the exercise stalled when they found that the vast majority of students were at risk.Asked recently what the city was doing to improve online learning for those students, the schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, said, "It\'s not sexy-sounding; it\'s not big newsworthy, but we\'re actually taking what teachers are doing and sharing those best practices with other teachers."Indeed, teachers and principals said they had largely been left to their own devices.Elsa Gilheany, a kindergarten teacher in the Bronx, spends many mornings tying her laundry bag around her shoulders to resemble a cape, in order to transform into what she calls a reading superhero. She kicks off a round of "pointer power," in which her students point to a word on their screen and sound it out, and "snap power," when children are asked to quickly identify words.But even with engaged students and parents, Gilheany said, "It\'s so much harder to do this through a computer, as opposed to a child being able to physically touch a book."Nikki Cistac, a high school English teacher in Manhattan, has sent copies of "The Great Gatsby" in Spanish to students\' parents who do not speak English at home, so they can follow along with their children. She asked students to create a playlist of their favorite songs, which Cistac lip-syncs on camera as students log into class.Now, she said, "kids are rarely late."Teachers across the city said they had learned to appreciate breakthroughs in virtual learning. For Matt Baker, a high school math teacher in Brooklyn, that moment came a few weeks ago, when his students starting singing along to a tune intended to help them memorize the quadratic formula.But those victories can feel all too rare."It\'s hard to get a good gauge on whether what you\'re doing is working," Baker said. "You kind of put it all out there. It\'s a lot of hoping."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Mr Johnson outlined his roadmap out of lockdown in the House of Commons on Monday, which included a four-step exit from current restrictions. The Prime Minister has said that the priority for Britain’s exit strategy will be “getting children back into school” and “prioritising ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely”. Mr Johnson faces fierce pressure from both sides of the lockdown divide. While the Prime Minister has been urged by the health service to focus on "data, not just dates", backbench Tory MPs are calling on Mr Johnson to unlock Britain’s economy and put trust in the UK’s vaccination programme. What do you think about the Prime Minister’s roadmap out of lockdown? Read on for the best discussion points from our readers and share your own view in the comments section at the bottom of this article. \'Outrageous\' @Bubo Scandiacus: "Weekly rates in my area are now significantly lower than they were when we were going to pubs and restaurants last year, and nobody had been vaccinated. "But now we have to wait three months before there\'s any meaningful relaxation. "And this on the day that it was announced that the vaccines are highly effective at preventing hospitalisations. This is outrageous. enough is enough." \'People will not comply\' @Mark Jordan: "Boris can dish out his petty micromanaging rules as much as he likes, but with the longer days, warmer weather and extreme lockdown fatigue - the chance of people complying with them is pretty much zero. "The more ridiculously cautious and disproportionate the restrictions are the more people will ignore them. "The genie is out of the bottle - and it ain’t going back in." \'The damage could be avoided by a more measured response\' @Fred Haroldson: "This cautious roadmap demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the practical reality most people are living through. It shows the dominance being given to Covid and a lack of awareness of the secondary damage the lockdown is causing. This current strategy is building for a public health disaster which will cause more issues for the NHS than Covid could. "The delays are heaping unnecessary pressure and damage on people and businesses which could be avoided by a more measured response." \'This is a stage-managed compromise\' @Anthony Kent: "The Prime Minister is caught between a rock and a hard place. Those who wish to open up more rapidly to boost the economy are up against some scientific advisers, who have a secure job unlike many, urging caution. You end up with a stage-managed compromise. I understand the Prime Minister\'s stance in this situation." \'Restrictions should be lifted immediately\' @Nick Matthews: "All aspects of lockdown and restrictions should be lifted immediately. I am sick of the increasingly coercive controls inflicted by this Government." \'The vaccine rollout is worth nothing if we can’t get on with our lives\' @David Spenley: "When will this Government stop treating us like children? These steps to some sort of normality are insulting. All the benefits of the exceptional vaccine rollout are worth nothing if we now can\'t start to get on with our lives like before. "The economy is on its knees, the social fabric of the country is in tatters, non-Covid cases are piling up, people\'s mental health is deteriorating and the best they can come up with is groups of six people can meet outside at the end of March? "For God\'s sake Boris, let us decide on the level of risk we are prepared to take. Get off our backs!" \'The number of cases shouldn’t be part of the equation\' @Bubo scandiacus: "A report from Scotland shows that the vaccines prevent hospitalisation. The number of cases shouldn’t be part of the equation. "Fewer patients in hospitals, fewer deaths, more vaccinated people, open things up. It’s not rocket science." \'It\'s ridiculous that I can\'t meet my elderly mother who\'s been vaccinated\' @Jeff Black: "It is rather ridiculous that I can\'t meet my elderly mother indoors when she has been fully vaccinated and I, as of last week, have had the first dose. "I\'d take those odds of infection any day." \'Why will hairdressers and beauticians remain closed?\' @Nicky Cox: "Someone please tell me the value of opening universities in April, it\'s the Easter holidays? "Also, why are hairdressers and beauticians are so far back in the opening when they all wear PPE? Surely a dentist and dental hygienist comes into far closer contact with you than a hairdresser? Open them up Boris and stop messing around." \'The economy won\'t recover\' @Hen Frost: "I understand a bit of caution to placate the nervous. However, there is absolutely no justification, with a stellar vaccination rollout, for us being kept in semi-lockdown until summer with no guarantee that this is the last time. "Unless the Government is crystal clear that they will never lockdown again, the economy won’t recover and neither will the country." \'The data has to be continually reviewed\' @Mark Williams: "Boris\'s approach is right. You can\'t define a precise algorithm for lifting the lockdown. That would be ridiculous. The data has to be continually reviewed. "Boris has played a blinder by betting the farm on a vaccine. A reasonably cautious approach is required to capitalise on that success. "Covid-19 can still throw up surprises, as some European countries are now finding out." \'Boris is more concerned about having to change course\' @Wim Kotze: "I think Boris interprets the mission and pressure as presenting a plan he can stick to, instead of how he should be seeing it: a fast reopening. "He is more concerned about having to change course, risking embarrassment. As such, whatever he says, politics is playing a huge role over science." \'We need to learn lessons from last year\' @Hannah PEARCE: "Why risk short-term gain for long-term pain? Surely we need to learn lessons from last year and not make the same mistakes by rushing to unlock everything too quickly. So many of us have not yet been vaccinated or are still awaiting their second vaccine." Have you got a question about Britain\'s roadmap out of lockdown?

It is often eerily quiet, and when no customers come by, Lee at times sits at her work station and weeps."Maybe, just maybe, tomorrow will be busy," she said. "I\'m waiting."Like nail salons across New York City, her business had to close when the pandemic hit in March. There was a brief surge in demand after the lockdown was lifted in July, but then appointments started dwindling. Often, customers requested cheaper services. Now, they hardly come at all.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe beauty industry in the city seemed well positioned to bounce back after restrictions ended. After all, many customers had spent months without professional grooming. But now, many of these businesses are on the verge of collapse -- a drastic hit for an industry that is an economic engine for immigrant women.Some nail salons have had a difficult time persuading customers that it is safe to come in. Others, especially those in Manhattan business districts, have yet to see regular customers come back because many of them had left the city or are working from home.With 26 years of nail salon experience and 20 years of savings poured into her own business, Lee, 53, said there was nothing else that she can imagine doing. But she\'s barely staying afloat."Even though it was hard before, I was always able to pay the bills. But now, no matter how hard I work, I make no money," she said.Nail salon visits in the state have dropped by more than 50%, and sales have fallen by more than 40%, according to an October survey of 161 salon owners conducted by the Nail Industry Federation of New York.The New York Nail Salon Workers Association, an advocacy group affiliated with the union Workers United, said less than half of 594 workers surveyed had returned to work as of August. In New York City, there were 4,240 nail salons in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Three percent of the country\'s nail salons are in Brooklyn, and 2% are in Queens."The workforce is primarily immigrant workers living paycheck to paycheck, supporting children and in many cases sick and aging family members in their own countries," said Luis Gomez, the association\'s organizing director. "Add the recession and the effects of the pandemic on top, and we anticipate that many workers will fall even deeper into poverty."In Queens, Rambika Ulak KC, 50, said she had so much business shortly after reopening in July that she hired back all 10 of her employees part time. But now, she sees only about four customers a day.Ulak dropped out of college in Nepal to come to the United States. When she developed carpal tunnel from giving manicures or was berated by customers frustrated by her poor English, she would fix her eyes on the photos of her daughter taped to the wall. Now, as her business erodes, she finds herself looking back at the photos even more often."That\'s why I work so hard," Ulak said. "So I can tell her, \'Don\'t think of my future, just be happy and focus on your studies.\'"Salons were able to reopen in July at 50% capacity, with waiting rooms banned and walk-ins discouraged.While indoor services pose more risks for virus transmission, Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that if everyone wears masks and customers are properly social distancing, they\'re "somewhat safer than with indoor dining."Still, many industry leaders worry that salons won\'t be able to win back customers\' full confidence and subsequently recover until a vaccine is in wide use.Eighty-one percent of the national nail salon workforce are women while 79% are foreign-born, according to a 2018 report conducted by the UCLA Labor Center.Older women may have less career flexibility should the industry continue to crater, said Prarthana Gurung, campaign manager at Adhikaar, a Nepali work center that assists nearly 1,300 Nepali-speaking salon workers in New York City."There is a subset of women who\'ve been in the nail salon industry for decades, and this is it regardless of what happens," Gurung said.Hannah Lee, 60, is one of those women: Since she arrived in the United States, she has worked only in nail salons. Lee reluctantly left South Korea after her husband persuaded her there would be better jobs here, she said.Though she missed South Korea, she didn\'t complain -- as a salon worker, Lee learned English on the job, saved enough to put her son through college and always paid her rent on time.Even now, Lee recognizes she is lucky to be hired back at salons in Queens and Manhattan, where she worked before the pandemic. But she said both salons rarely have any customers these days. She often receives only a few dollars in tips, sometimes nothing at all.Her pay plummeted from $1,000 per week to $300. She\'s behind on rent and is barely able to afford groceries, she said. But she said she refused to look into other industries and is on the hunt for a third nail salon gig despite her worries about her health."I just want to feel comfortable with my life. I don\'t want anxiety when I go to work about whether customers will come today or not, whether I will get the virus today or not," she said in Korean.In Jackson Heights, Queens, Mariwvey Ramirez, 38, recently went back to work after being furloughed for a second time at the Rego Park salon where she worked because of the neighborhood closures.The first time, back in March, was financially devastating for Ramirez, who is undocumented and therefore ineligible to collect unemployment. Even now, Ramirez, a single mother, was only hired back part time. Her wages went from $700 a week to $400.Ramirez moved to the United States from Mexico 18 years ago to be with her brother, who moved to the country first, and worked in the salon industry for 17 years."I don\'t know how to do anything else, for all these years, I worked in nail salons -- really my whole life," she said in Spanish.The only silver lining has been that now that she has free time, she has enrolled in a class to learn English -- in part to broaden her job opportunities, but mostly to advance in the nail salon industry once the pandemic subsides.Juyoung Lee, the owner of the Beverly Nail Studio, moved from South Korea to New York City 30 years ago. When she arrived, she could only find work in the dry cleaning, garment and nail salon industries because of her limited English.She first landed a job at a sewing factory, but a few years later, it closed down. She tried her luck in the nail business, saving up for more than two decades to open up her own salon.When Lee first toured the vacant storefront that would become her salon in 2014, the real estate agent told her he couldn\'t imagine the worn-down space turning into a nail shop, she recalled. But Lee could see it -- the pink walls, a row of plush pedicure chairs, a collection of nail polish in every conceivable color."This was my dream," Lee said. "Really, this is every employee\'s dream to open up their own salon."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. And yet, she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City’s vaccine finder page Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care’s corporate office, which told her to wait. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times She wanted to register at the new Javits Convention Center megasite, which she heard about on the news, but couldn’t figure out how. “I’m willing to wait my turn,” she said, frustrated, “but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn.” In the city, over 1 million older New Yorkers started the week with optimism that they would finally gain access to the vaccine after months of fearing they would fall victim to the coronavirus. But the reality of actually getting the shots has proved to be far more maddening. Buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems that act in parallel but do not link together and a lack of outreach are causing exasperation and exhaustion among older New Yorkers and others trying to set up vaccination appointments. It is also stymying New York’s early efforts to get the vaccine to many of the city’s most vulnerable, creating a situation that elected officials say risks exacerbating the inequalities that COVID-19 has already laid painfully bare. The race to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers has reached a critical point, as officials Wednesday announced that two cases of a more contagious British variant of the virus had been detected in New York City, one in Manhattan and one in Queens. The state has used 35% of its available vaccine, in line with the national average in a rollout that has gone far slower than expected nationwide. New York City has distributed 38% of its shots, with 491,000 available doses as of Thursday. But in the race to get shots in arms, some say the bigger picture about exactly whose arms should be prioritized has been lost. “Here we are, facing a global pandemic, with thousands of New Yorkers who have lost their lives, and who is again the forgotten group of people? The very people who need help the most,” said Mark Treyger, a city councilman from Brooklyn who said his office had been inundated with calls from family members trying to get appointments for their parents. In New York City, more than 2 million residents now qualify for the vaccine, including over 1 million people older than 65 who became eligible this week. The city’s vaccine supply varies, with about 100,000 doses coming this week from the federal government, although some weeks it has received double that amount. Even as the city and state rush to stand up a huge distribution network, there are increasing worries about supply, with essential workers — including teachers, police officers, transit workers and grocery store clerks — and people older than 65 racing to make appointments. About 26,000 shots per day are now being administered in the city. “Right now, if we don’t get more vaccine, there literally will not be appointments available after the next couple of weeks,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a Wednesday news conference. He called the frustrating sign-up system a smaller problem by comparison. On Thursday, the main New York state website posted an all-caps alert, blaming the federal government for not sending enough shots for the 7 million New Yorkers now eligible and saying all appointments at state-run sites were booked for the next 14 weeks. Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez, the city's commissioner for the Department for the Aging, said 290 participant organizations were making 60,000 calls per week to older adults to let them know about the vaccine and help them schedule visits. The problem, people who work in senior services say, is that these systems were not sufficiently organized ahead of time. Allison Nickerson, executive director of LiveOn NY, an advocacy organization for older New Yorkers, said that she had been asked to participate in a task force on rolling out the vaccine to those older than 75, but it hadn’t met yet. Several nonprofit social service organizations said that save for being given a script to read to people on a phone call, and a link to the same vaccine finder map that Engle was struggling with, they hadn’t been consulted. The city announced Thursday a new program to vaccinate seniors who live in public housing, beginning with the opening of three clinics in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island. “There is a big aging services network whose remit is to reach the poorest, oldest, least capacitated people,” said Ruth Finkelstein, executive director of the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging at Hunter College. “But those agencies have not been central to the distribution strategy.” In Jackson Heights, Roseline David, 80, a retired auditor, said she had been trying to get vaccination appointments for herself and her husband since Monday. She sent repeated messages to her regular doctor. She spent hours on the city’s website Tuesday night, painstakingly filling out forms, only to find out at the end that there was no availability and she had to cancel out of the system. She called 311 and is waiting for a call back. “I’ve spent about 18 to 19 hours so far,” she said Wednesday. “I call this harassment. It affects my mental ability to do other things. And this is only for the first shot; who knows when the second shot is coming?” Along with older New Yorkers, people who speak languages other than English are also disadvantaged, as well as those who cannot use a computer, Treyger and others said. There is a phone hotline, but hold times can be long. A key issue is the disconnect between the city and the state’s systems for setting up appointments, which is leading to confusion on the ground. At Hillcrest High School in Queens on Wednesday, a vaccination hub run by the city, a handful of people who had signed up via the state’s website were told by health department staff that they were in the wrong place and would have to go to a community health center located in a former firehouse about a half mile away. Struggling with their phones, a few people failed to produce their appointment identification numbers for health workers, or a corresponding QR code that would confirm their appointments. Staff in blue vests helped sort out the confusion and, in some cases, scheduled appointments for people who thought they had already scheduled them. “Some people don’t even have computers,” said Hilary Umans, who had brought her mother, Priscilla, for her vaccine. “What if you don’t have a smartphone? And what if you’re not a native English speaker?” Dave Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said at a City Council oversight hearing Tuesday that to some extent, the separate sign-up systems cannot be helped: Each major player in the effort has separate medical records systems that vaccination schedules must link to. Each participating urgent care also has its own scheduling system, as do Costco, Rite Aid and dozens of other providers. The city is trying to streamline the sign-up system to make it simpler, he said. But it has not yet announced how it will tackle the other huge challenges of how to get frail adults without transportation safely to vaccine appointments, and how to reach the city’s tens of thousands of homebound older New Yorkers. “We have to ensure that the experience, particularly for our elders, including frail elders, is as easy as possible,” Chokshi said. For now, many older adults are getting help from friends and relatives, but even that is no guarantee of success. In Riverdale, in the Bronx, Annette Gaudino, who works as policy director for a health advocacy organization, had been trying to register her 95-year-old mother for two days, checking multiple locations. She was not sure if she would be allowed to accompany her to the appointment. “My mom is increasingly confused, needs a walker and has a part-time home care aide who also needs vaccination,” she said. “There’s got to be a better way.” Joan Jeffri, 76, who lives in Midwood, Brooklyn — and who was frustrated after being confirmed for an urgent care appointment only to be told later that they had no vaccine — sent a letter to Gov. Andrew Cuomo alerting him to the problems. The lightest moment in her last few days, she said, was when she clicked on the link to her local Rite Aid through the city’s website, only to be told there were 11,624 people waiting to enter the website in front of her. “I burst out laughing,” she said. Her daughter-in-law finally got her an appointment at a city site after two hours of effort, and she goes for her shot in two weeks. “Everyone I speak to is insanely and completely frustrated,” Jeffri said, “and has spent between two and eight hours or more trying to get through.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company", 'num_of_covid': 1}

None have been set aside for South Africa.The country, which will help manufacture the vaccine and whose citizens have enrolled in clinical trials, does not expect to see the first trickle of doses until around the middle of next year. By then, the United States, Britain and Canada, which have already started, may have vaccinated more than 100 million people.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe first year of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a country\'s wealth would not spare it from the virus. Overconfidence, poor planning and ignored warnings felled some of the world\'s richest nations. But now, money is translating into undeniable advantages.Over the past few months, rich nations like the United States and Britain have cut deals with multiple drug manufacturers and secured enough doses to vaccinate their citizens many times over. China and Russia have conducted their own trials and begun mass vaccination programs.Yet countries like South Africa are in a singular bind because they cannot hold out hope for charity. Although its government is nearly insolvent and half of its citizens live in poverty, South Africa is considered too rich to qualify for cut-rate vaccines from international aid organizations."Where you\'re not rich enough but you\'re not poor enough, you\'re stuck," said Salim Abdool Karim, a public health researcher who leads the country\'s coronavirus advisory council.Poor and middle-income nations, largely unable to compete in the open market, rely on a complex vaccine sharing scheme called Covax. A collaboration of international health organizations, Covax was designed to avoid the inequities of a free-market free-for-all. But its deals come with strings attached, and health advocates are questioning its transparency and accountability.By the middle of next year, South African officials hope to secure their first vaccine doses under Covax, even as they negotiate to buy supplemental supplies from drug manufacturers. But in a country where luxury estates are walled off from sprawling squatter villages, many expect the newest vaccines to remain a privilege for residents who can pay out of pocket or through supplemental insurance -- a program that disproportionately benefits white people."You\'ll be able to stride into your local private pharmacy and pay a couple hundred rand (about $15) and say, \'Hit me baby,\'" said Francois Venter, a researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\'Maybe We\'ll Get the Vaccine in 2025\'The best chance that many South Africans have to get vaccinated anytime soon is to volunteer for a clinical trial and test unproven vaccines on their bodies. But that arrangement has raised ethical questions.First is whether countries like South Africa, which is supporting trials by four drugmakers, should be guaranteed doses if the trials succeed. The government hasn\'t received such a guarantee. And at any rate, such an arrangement would be ethically murky, since it would punish countries that participate in unsuccessful trials.This month, as Britain prepared to begin its vaccination campaign, dozens of people walked from their shacks in Masiphumelele township, south of Cape Town, to the gates of the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation.They waited outside for hours, under the shade of a gum tree, for a chance to enroll in a clinical trial of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine."The people at the top, they\'re going to get the vaccine, the people who have power," said Mtshaba Mzwamadoda, 42, who lives in a one-bedroom corrugated metal shack with his wife and three children. "Maybe we\'ll get the vaccine in 2025.""We\'ll all be dead then," said Prudence Nonzamedyantyi, 46, a housekeeper from the same township."That\'s why we signed up," Mzwamadoda said. "This is the only chance I have."Katherine Gill, an AIDS researcher who is leading the trial, usually tempers her enthusiasm for such tests. But early results from other drugmakers have been promising. "My assumption is that unless you get onto a vaccine study, you\'re not going to have access to any vaccine anytime soon," Gill said, "which is obviously quite heartbreaking."In the 1990s, when antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV were developed, South Africans volunteered for clinical trials, knowing that they could never afford the medicine otherwise. "If you had money, you were able to buy it. If you didn\'t, you died," Venter said. "It\'s going to be the same thing again."Covax was set up to prevent that. It came together with money and support from the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. Countries, even those that cannot hope to compete on the open market, can buy into Covax and receive vaccines. Poor countries pay nothing.Secret DealsSouth African medical advisers say the Covax system is incredibly important but also deeply frustrating. Governments must pay upfront without knowing what vaccine they will receive or getting any guarantees on when the doses will arrive. Covax estimates the price per dose but offers little recourse if the cost is ultimately much higher. Countries must assume all of the risk if the vaccine fails or if anything goes wrong.During a recent call with reporters, Covax officials called their vaccine sharing program "the only global solution to this pandemic.""We still need more doses and, yes, we still need more money, but we have a clear pathway to securing the initial 2 billion doses and then beyond that," said Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.Still, Berkley and other officials declined to reveal their arrangements with drug companies, describing them as company secrets. They also did not make public the deals they have struck with individual countries."They\'re agreeing to buy something with public money, and we won\'t have any influence on pricing," said Fatima Hassan, a human rights lawyer. "Covax is saying the pricing is fair, but we don\'t know. Where\'s the transparency?"Those trade-offs might be palatable for countries receiving the medicine nearly free. But South Africa is paying about $140 million for its Covax doses to vaccinate roughly 10% of its population, including health care workers and some high-risk people. The government hopes to cover the country\'s remaining 50 million people through private deals with drug companies.Globally, the process is secretive, with governments not disclosing the prices they are paying for vaccines. When a Belgian minister recently published the European Union\'s price list, she revealed that prices vary depending on who\'s doing the buying.Many South Africans are deeply skeptical of pharmaceutical companies and wary of rampant government corruption. The health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said in a recent call with reporters that it was essential that rich countries not hoard vaccines, but otherwise the government has said little about its plans.Outraged, health advocates have threatened to sue the country\'s government to make the plans public.Ultimately, though, money is the great differentiator. From the outset, South Africa\'s government knew it could not afford to order doses before they were tested and approved, as wealthy countries did."While these countries have gone on a shopping spree, we haven\'t even started window shopping," Ames Dhai, a bioethics professor and member of the government\'s vaccine advisory panel, told doctors on a recent webinar.No GuaranteeSouth Africa has seen this play out before. In 2009, when the world feared a devastating H1N1 flu outbreak, rich countries hoarded the earliest vaccines. While the outbreak was far weaker than expected, it revealed the inequities that exist when countries compete for lifesaving medicine.One example is the HPV vaccine, a drug that can prevent cervical cancer but is in short supply in South Africa. Supplies are so tight that the World Health Organization has recommended that wealthy countries temporarily stop expanding their vaccinating campaigns to cover boys, so other nations can focus at least on covering young girls.For the COVID-19 vaccine, government officials and advisers say they have met with or received preliminary inquiries from most of the major drug companies.Abdool Karim, the head of the country\'s coronavirus council, said the country needed to be judicious in choosing a vaccine that best fits the needs of South Africa. Rushing to buy the Pfizer vaccine, for example, which requires shipping and storage at ultracold temperatures, made no sense when cheaper, simpler and more manageable medicines were on the horizon, he said.But because South Africa did not preorder doses from private companies, the country may have to watch its own domestic drugmaker, Aspen Pharmacare, produce vaccines for other countries before they are available domestically.Under contract with Johnson & Johnson, Aspen is expected to produce millions of vaccine doses. South African officials have high hopes for the vaccine, which does not need cold storage and promises to require one injection rather than two."We\'ll participate in your trials, we\'ll manufacture your vaccines, but we don\'t know if we\'ll get access," Hassan said.Johnson & Johnson has promised to sell its vaccines at break-even prices and provide half a billion doses to Covax to help poor countries. Aspen\'s chief executive, Stephen Saad, said he was proud of that commitment. But he acknowledged that there is no guarantee for South Africa."It\'s J&J\'s decision as to where the product goes," he said.South Africa, which is now past 1 million COVID-19 cases, is facing its second wave. Public health officials are particularly worried about a new mutation that they believe may have made the virus more contagious.In poor and working-class townships, the greater fear is of a new lockdown. The government\'s earlier aggressive lockdown devastated the economy and confined many people to tin shacks built an arm\'s length apart, with a dozen families sharing an outhouse and many more sharing a water tap."It\'s impossible to have social distancing here," said Mzwamadoda, who was selected for the drug trial.He is counting on the vaccine, hoping he got the actual medicine and not a placebo. "I want my life back," he said.Mzwamadoda woke up the day after his injection feeling well. He talked it over with his wife, and they decided that she would walk to Gill\'s clinic and enroll that weekend.A few days later, though, Gill got word that Johnson & Johnson did not need any new test subjects at her location.Data was pouring in. A good outcome, but that meant that when people began lining up at the gates early the next morning, she had to turn them away.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '7978e9036579578725c5a9d8be23a714', 'title': 'Where a Vaccination Campaign Faces Skepticism, War and Corruption', 'description': 'KABUL, Afghanistan — Afghanistan, whose citizens have largely brushed aside the coronavirus pandemic as exaggerated or an outright hoax, is now preparing to distribute its first batch of vaccines. A half-million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, produced by an Indian manufacturer, were delivered to the capital, Kabul, by India on Feb. 7. But the arrival was greeted with indifference by many Afghans, who have rebuffed government warnings that the virus is a deadly public health threat. The cheap and easy-to-store AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is being delivered as part of the Covax program, a worldwide initiative to buy and distribute vaccines to poor countries for free or at a reduced cost. On Feb. 15, the World Health Organization authorized use of the vaccine, which requires two doses per person, clearing the path for Afghanistan to begin its inoculation campaign. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Global trials have found that the vaccine offered complete protection against severe disease and death. But its efficacy against the virus variant first seen in South Africa is in question, after the vaccine failed in a small trial to prevent study participants from getting mild or moderate COVID cases. The vaccine arrives as Afghanistan is fighting off a second deadly wave, even as most Afghans go about their daily lives as if the virus never existed. Many people refuse to wear masks and cluster in dense crowds inside bazaars, supermarkets, restaurants and mosques, oblivious to ubiquitous public health posters. In an impoverished nation battered by war, hunger, poverty and drought, an invisible virus is considered fake or an afterthought. “Of course I won’t take the vaccine because I don’t believe in the existence of the coronavirus,” said Muhibullah Armani, 30, a taxi driver in the southern city of Kandahar. Expressing a sentiment shared by many Afghans, Armani added, “When I see people covering their mouth and nose, afraid of COVID, it makes me laugh at them.” And even among Afghans who believe the virus is real and want to be inoculated, there is little faith that the government, mired in pervasive corruption, will equitably distribute limited vaccine supplies. “This vaccine will be available just for high status people,” said Khalil Jan Gurbazwal, a civil society activist in Khost province in eastern Afghanistan. Nizamuddin, a tribal elder in a Taliban-controlled district in Faryab province in northern Afghanistan, said he feared the vaccine would be appropriated by well-connected politicians and warlords. “It is common in Afghanistan for even food aid to be stolen by corrupt people,” said Nizamuddin, who like many Afghans goes by one name. The Attorney General’s Office said Thursday that 74 government officials from five provinces had been charged with embezzling coronavirus response funds. Among those charged were former provincial governors and deputy governors. In Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan, a hospital administrator told authorities that hospital officials collected medical costs for COVID-19 treatments for 50 beds in a hospital with just 25 beds, pocketing charges for “ghost workers,” the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction recently reported. “This malfeasance costs Afghan citizens not just financially, but in delayed access to potentially lifesaving medical care,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. But for many Afghans, the vaccine is a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. As the vaccination program got underway Tuesday, the first dose was administered at the presidential palace in Kabul to Anisa Shaheed, a television reporter who has covered the pandemic. Distributing any vaccine in a desperately poor nation consumed by unrest is a daunting logistical challenge. In addition to overcoming public suspicions and traversing dangerous territories, the Ministry of Public Health must also navigate vaccine delivery in remote provinces with poor roads and primitive infrastructure. The pandemic has prompted a rise in polio cases in Afghanistan because it has made it more difficult for polio teams to reach outlying areas, said Dr. Osman Tahiri, public affairs adviser for the health ministry, which reported 56 polio cases in 2020, up from 29 in 2019. But equally worrying are the 305 cases of a variant of polio in Afghanistan in 2020, versus zero such cases reported in 2019, said Merjan Rasekh, head of public awareness for the ministry’s polio eradication program. Rasekh attributed much of the increase in the variant polio cases to Afghan refugees returning from neighboring Pakistan, which has also struggled to eradicate polio. The WHO is expected to grant emergency approval by year’s end for a vaccine against the variant. While contending with a rise of polio cases, Tahiri said health workers would try to distribute the coronavirus vaccine even in Taliban-controlled areas where the militants have permitted government-run clinics. The Taliban have mounted public health programs warning of the pandemic and have distributed personal protection equipment while allowing government health workers into their areas. But Tahiri conceded that vaccination teams will not be able to reach broad swaths of the country where fighting is heaviest between the Taliban and government forces. A thousand vaccination teams were trained last week, Tahiri said. The ministry hopes to receive more donated vaccines; Afghanistan, he said, has a capacity to store 20 million doses. The first doses will go to health workers and security officials “who are at risk and working in crowded places,” Tahiri said, though there is not yet enough vaccine for everyone in this category. Journalists would also be eligible to apply to receive the vaccine, he added. Afghanistan has recorded more than 55,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 2,500 COVID-related deaths, according to the Ministry of Public Health. But because of limited testing and an inadequate public health system, experts say the actual number of cases and deaths is exponentially higher. A WHO model estimated in May that more than half of Afghanistan’s estimated 34 million people could become infected. The Ministry of Public Health estimated in the fall that more than 10 million Afghans may have contracted the virus. Regardless of whether Afghans believe the virus is real, there is an abiding faith that Allah determines a believer’s fate. Ahmad Shah Ahmadi, a resident of Khost province, said there is no need to take the vaccine. “Infidels don’t believe in God, and that’s why they fear the coronavirus. For Muslims, there is little danger,” he said. But Imam Nazar, 46, a farmer in Kunduz province, said most residents of his village believe the virus is real because several villagers have died of COVID-19. He said he and other villagers were eager to get the vaccine but doubted that it would reach their remote town. “This government doesn’t keep its promises,” Nazar said.

Holding an impeachment trial is not "political theater" or a "waste of time," Kinzinger wrote. "If the GOP doesn\'t take a stand, the chaos of the past few months, and the past few years, could quickly return. The future of our party and our country depends on confronting what happened — so it doesn\'t happen again." Impeaching Trump shows that "enough is enough," Kinzinger said, and he warned that "the situation could get much, much worse — with more violence and more division that cannot be overcome. The further down this road we go, the closer we come to the end of America as we know it." He called out Republicans who "encouraged" Trump\'s "dangerous lie" that the presidential election was stolen, and said the GOP of his youth "would never take that road." Trump "changed that dynamic," making the Republican Party one that runs on "outrage and the fear of a darker future." Kinzinger thinks more Republican voters "reject" this, but many have gone silent because "they assume the party\'s leaders no longer represent them." Since voting to impeach, Kinzinger said he has heard from "tens of thousands of my constituents," and their reaction has been "overwhelmingly supportive." He "firmly" believes that the majority of Americans "reject the madness of the past four years," but the country won\'t be able to move forward "by ignoring what happened or refusing to hold accountable those responsible." That\'s a recipe for "chaos in the years ahead," which is why convicting Trump is "necessary to save America from going further down a sad, dangerous road."

{'_id': '475d27b2eaa1c0ce599cb9a48db3f976', 'title': "New York Was the 1st Big School District to Reopen. Here's What Happened.", 'description': 'NEW YORK — For Julie Zuckerman, an elementary school principal in Manhattan, last summer felt like one never-ending day filled with fear and confusion about New York City’s plan to resume in-person teaching. But in the months since classrooms opened in September, something has shifted. Teachers at the school, Public School 513 in Washington Heights, appear more at ease, and some say they would like to be in their classrooms even when the building closes because of coronavirus cases. Parents, too, seem more confident: About half of the students are in the building most days, up from less than one-third in September. Zuckerman expects that even more children will return this spring. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “People have made their peace; they’re not in crisis in the same way,” she said. “I feel there’s a huge night-and-day difference between what was going on last spring and what’s happened this year.” New York’s push to become the first big school district in the country to reopen classrooms last fall was a high-stakes and risky experiment. It has had its share of miscommunication, logistical stumbles and disruptions — especially when classrooms and school buildings are frequently closed because of virus cases. But in interviews, parents, teachers, principals and union leaders also provided reasons for optimism at the midpoint of the academic year. In-school transmission of the coronavirus been very low, and there has also been broad agreement that children have benefited from being in classrooms. “Having the kids here is so much better for them, for everyone,” Zuckerman said. The strength of the plan will be tested again in the coming weeks, as about 62,000 middle school students are set to return to classrooms for the first time since November. New York also offers the clearest preview in the United States of what other big city districts — most prominently Chicago, where more schools are set to open next month — can expect as they inch closer to reopening classrooms after almost a year of remote learning. Despite President Joe Biden’s push to reopen more schools this spring, some districts — including Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest system — do not yet have a plan to reopen at all this school year. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that schools should open as soon as possible, particularly for young children. The CDC found that teacher vaccines are not a precondition for reopening, a finding that has been backed up by New York’s safety record so far. The guidance came as teachers unions across the country have continued to push back on reopening plans. Districts that do reopen to students in the coming weeks and months are likely to discover that it is just a first step. New Yorkers have struggled to cope with the frequent interruptions to learning — and parents’ schedules — caused when virus cases are detected among students or staff members and classrooms and entire school buildings are forced into all-remote instruction. The city requires schools to shutter for up to 10 days if two unrelated positive cases are confirmed in a building. Individual classrooms close when one or more positive cases are detected. The number of closed classrooms and schools has risen considerably over the last few weeks, as test positivity rates across the city have remained high and weekly in-school testing has increased. Between Jan. 4 and Feb. 10, 580 of 1,052 open school buildings closed for up to two weeks. Fewer than 400 school buildings have not had a closing of any kind in the new year. Zuckerman said that her school, for example, has been open for only about 10 in-person days in 2021. The rule was developed at a moment when it was unclear whether Mayor Bill de Blasio had the political support to reopen schools, and when there was much less evidence that schools could reopen safely. The protocol was part of a package of safety measures, agreed on with union leaders over the summer, that allowed New York City to open its schools in the first place. De Blasio said earlier this month that he would reevaluate the two-case rule, though city officials said it was highly unlikely that safety measures would change before the reopening of middle schools. For parents of elementary school children, the reopening experience has prompted a roller coaster of emotions: despair over the limits of remote learning; joy at seeing their children back in classrooms; and frustration with the chaos caused by closings. Last month, for example, Hien Sosa finally got the news that her son could soon return full time to his first-grade classroom in East Elmhurst, Queens. “I was like, wow, I feel like I just won the lottery,” Sosa, a hospital nurse, recalled. She and her husband, a police officer, could not stay home on the days when their son learned remotely. Sosa’s mother, who helps with child care, speaks limited English and has trouble supervising her grandson’s lessons. Sosa said she felt “ready to give up.” But her relief about the new schedule was short-lived. Just a few days after her son began attending school five days a week, Sosa learned that the school would close for 10 days because two people in the building tested positive. He returned a few days ago and comes home happy at the end of the day. “I know he gets some real learning, just a regular school day like he always had,” Sosa said. But she said she felt like she was on borrowed time until the school shuts again. As closures have increased, some parents have called on the city to change the rule. But the city’s influential teachers union has vigorously protested any change, saying schools are safe in part because of the conservative threshold for closures. But the union, the United Federation of Teachers, may face growing pressure to accept changes to the rule as more teachers are vaccinated. The union has directly arranged for about 15,500 educators to be vaccinated, according to a union spokesperson, while many other teachers have gotten their shots through regular channels. Even before vaccines arrived in New York, the city’s schools had not seen high transmission; the average test positivity rate in city schools was 0.55% between October and last Thursday. The seven-day citywide average has been hovering around 8%. The statistics are partially explained by the random weekly testing of asymptomatic students and staff members, which results in lower rates than citywide testing of people who are showing symptoms or think they have been exposed to the virus. But the schools statistic also bolsters the view, widely held by health experts, that classrooms can be relatively safe if educators enforce safety measures like mask-wearing and social distancing, which are required in city schools. After de Blasio shuttered the entire system in mid-November because of rising virus cases, he reopened classrooms only for children with complex disabilities and elementary school students in December. Recently, he announced that middle schools would reopen Feb. 25. City officials say most middle schools will be able to accommodate many students five days a week. About 500 of the 878 elementary schools and schools for children with disabilities that are already open are serving most students full time. It is not clear whether city high schools will reopen this school year. Once both elementary and middle schools are open, up to 250,000 of the city’s roughly 1 million students will be able to return to classrooms. Still, the vast majority of city families — roughly 70% — have decided to keep their children learning from home for the rest of the school year. White students, who make up a minority of the overall system, are overrepresented in open classrooms. Chloe Davis, a teacher in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, said her elementary school has been closed several times since Thanksgiving. That prompted some families to shift to remote learning to regain consistency. “We haven’t been able to find a rhythm at all,” she said. Davis’ school shares a building with two others, and if two students test positive in any of the three schools, the entire building is closed. The stream of closings is especially frustrating for working parents like Elisa Muñiz, a pediatrician and single parent of a second grader in Washington Heights. Muñiz said her son, who receives special education services, had been in his classroom for fewer than 30 days since September. “I can’t tell you how many times the school has closed; it’s a ton,” she said. “It doesn’t just disrupt home life. I’m someone who has a responsibility to be in person at work. It requires a lot more flexibility than sometimes we’re able to have.” Muñiz has watched her son, an only child, thrive on the days when he is in classrooms with his friends. But he is easily distracted and restless when he switches back to online learning. She wishes she could ask the mayor, “How are we going to help the kids who aren’t making progress?” New York’s teachers say they are working harder than at any other point in their careers to address that question. Tiffany Koo, who teaches at an elementary school in the East Village, decided last year to take sole responsibility for a group of students learning online, and another in person, because of a staffing shortage at her school. She livestreams her lessons daily from her classroom so that all students can follow along, and spends nights and weekends working on lesson plans. “I don’t ever regret it, but it has been incredibly chaotic and difficult at times,” she said of her schedule. “I’m taking it day by day.” Some days, Koo is not sure the trade-offs of reopening are worth it. Still, she understands why so many parents and students want classrooms to be fully open as soon as possible. She just asks that New Yorkers be patient. “We all wish this was different,” she said. “Let’s just be kind to each other. We’re all trying to do the best we can.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Speaking near his home in Wilmington, Delaware on Friday, Biden said he would invoke the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of equipment needed for vaccine rollout, refrigeration and storage.  BIDEN: “Look, our plan is as clear as it is bold, get more people vaccinated for free, create more places for them to get vaccinated, mobilize more medical teams to get the shots in people\'s arms, increase supply and get it out the door as soon as possible."  Under Biden\'s plan, federal disaster-relief workers would set up thousands of vaccination centers, where retired doctors would administer shots to teachers, grocery store workers, people over 65 years old and other groups who do not currently qualify.  He has pledged to vaccinate 100 million Americans during his first 100 days in office as the coronavirus has killed more than 390,000 people in the U.S. and the death tally could reach 500,000 by February, according to a top Biden adviser. Biden said his administration will release the vast majority of doses when they become available, rather than holding back a large portion to ensure that recipients can get a second dose, which had been the Trump administration\'s approach for much of the rollout.  The Trump administration had aimed to give vaccine doses to 20 million Americans by the end of 2020, but only 12.3 million coronavirus shots had been administered as of Friday morning out of more than 31 million doses distributed to states, according to data from the CDC. MINNESOTA GOV. TIM WALZ: “They were lying. They don\'t have any doses held back. There is no strategic supply for the second doses." Biden’s vaccine plan comes as governors of several states accused the Trump administration on Friday of deception in pledging to immediately distribute millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses from a stockpile that the U.S. health secretary has since acknowledged does not exist. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar had said on Tuesday that the administration would release millions of doses it had been holding in reserve for booster shots in order to help spur a sluggish rollout of first doses to those most in need of the vaccine.  But on Friday Azar suggested in an interview with NBC News that the doses in question had already been allocated to the states.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

And President Biden will mark the solemn milestone with a moment of silence and a candle-lighting ceremony at the White House at sundown, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Biden will also deliver some remarks, the White House said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s top infectious disease expert and Biden\'s chief medical adviser, said Sunday that crossing half a million deaths is "terrible" and "really horrible." "It\'s nothing like we\'ve ever been through in the last 102 years since the 1918 influenza pandemic," he told CNN\'s Dana Bash. "People decades from now are going to be talking about this as a terribly historic milestone in the history of this country." Fauci confirmed that the U.S. will have 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines by July, enough "to be able to vaccinate virtually anybody and everybody," he told Fox News Sunday. The number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are falling steadily but still high, he added, and it\'s important to maintain public health measures. "As the nation reaches the milestone of a half-million deaths about a year after the first American succumbed to the coronavirus," The Washington Post contextualizes, "the necropolis of COVID has grown into a city of sorrow the size of Atlanta or Sacramento — a death toll larger than the combined American losses in combat from the Civil War, World War I, and World War II, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs."

"Do people see just how destroyed your family and your life is, six months later? Half-a-million families who\'ve had their world torn apart?" Gigis one of at least 271 children who have died from the coronavirus, the Post reports, and "each death represents a shattered family and a trauma deepened, parents say, by the rampant belief that kids can\'t get covid, or that it doesn\'t much harm them when they do."

{'_id': '80487c20928f44d1a2e815bf465a2c56', 'title': 'The U.S. Is Sitting on Tens of Millions of Vaccine Doses the World Needs', 'description': 'WASHINGTON — Tens of millions of doses of the coronavirus vaccine made by British-Swedish company AstraZeneca are sitting idly in U.S. manufacturing facilities, awaiting results from its U.S. clinical trial while countries that have authorized its use beg for access. The fate of those doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine is the subject of an intense debate among White House and federal health officials, with some arguing the administration should let them go abroad where they are desperately needed, while others are not ready to relinquish them, according to senior administration officials. AstraZeneca is involved in those conversations. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “We understand other governments may have reached out to the U.S. government about donation of AstraZeneca doses, and we’ve asked the U.S. government to give thoughtful consideration to these requests,” said Gonzalo Viña, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca. About 30 million doses are currently bottled at AstraZeneca’s facility in West Chester, Ohio, which handles “fill-finish,” the final phase of the manufacturing process, during which the vaccine is placed in vials, one official with knowledge of the stockpile said. Emergent BioSolutions, a company in Maryland that AstraZeneca has contracted to manufacture its vaccine in the United States, has also produced enough vaccine in Baltimore for tens of millions more doses once it is filled into vials and packaged, the official said. But although AstraZeneca’s vaccine is already authorized in more than 70 countries, according to a company spokesperson, its U.S. clinical trial has not yet reported results, and the company has not applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization. AstraZeneca has asked the Biden administration to let it loan U.S. doses to the European Union, where it has fallen short of its original supply commitments and where the vaccination campaign has stumbled badly. The administration, for now, has denied the request, one official said. Some federal officials have pushed the White House to make a decision in the next few weeks. Officials have discussed sending doses to the European Union, Britain and Brazil, all hit hard by a worsening coronavirus crisis. “If those donation actions were to proceed, we would seek guidance from the U.S. government on replacement of doses for use in the U.S.,” Viña said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The administration’s hesitation is at least partly related to uncertainties with vaccine supply before a bench mark of late May laid down by President Joe Biden — when he promised enough vaccine doses to cover every adult in the United States. Vaccine production is notoriously complex and delicate, and problems like mold growth can interrupt a plant’s progress. Last May, the Trump administration pledged up to $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca to finance the development and manufacturing of its vaccine, which it developed with the University of Oxford, and to supply the United States with 300 million doses if it proved effective. Federal officials and public health experts last year viewed the vaccine, which is less expensive and easier to store for long periods than some other vaccines, as most likely to be among the first to receive authorization. That never happened, in part because of a pattern of communication blunders by AstraZeneca that weakened the company’s relationship with U.S. regulators and slowed the vaccine’s development. Last fall, AstraZeneca’s trial in the United States — the same one that will soon report results — was grounded for nearly seven weeks because the company was slow to provide the FDA with evidence that the vaccine had not caused serious neurological side effects in two volunteers. The company is now grappling with another safety scare. Acting out of precaution, health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland suspended use of the AstraZeneca’s vaccine Thursday after several reports across the continent of severe blood clots. European official and the company said there was not evidence of any causal link. In the vast majority of cases, the emergence of such medical conditions has nothing to do with the vaccine. Some percentage of people are expected to fall ill by chance after getting vaccinated, as would happen in any group of people. AstraZeneca has also run into other problems as its vaccine has rolled out. The shortfall in supply has fueled tensions with European officials. Some people in Germany and other countries have balked at taking the vaccine, for fear it is second-class because of its lower overall efficacy in clinical trials compared with the vaccine from Pfizer. South Africa last month halted its plans to introduce the vaccine after a small clinical trial found that the vaccine did not appear to be protective against mild to moderate illness caused by a concerning coronavirus variant first seen there. In the United States, the Biden administration’s moves to order more supply of the three vaccines authorized by the FDA has further sidelined AstraZeneca’s candidate. The United States may only briefly, or never, need the AstraZeneca doses if they are cleared for emergency use. “If we have a surplus, we’re going to share it with the rest of the world,” Biden told reporters Wednesday, speaking generally about the U.S. vaccine supply. “We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first.” Johnson & Johnson, which has authorization for its vaccine in the United States but fell behind on its production targets in both the United States and Europe, recently asked the United States to loan 10 million doses to the European Union, but the Biden administration also denied that request, according to American and European officials. The European Union has come under fierce criticism for “vaccine nationalism” and protectionism, which intensified last week when Italy blocked a small shipment of doses to Australia, stepping up a tug of war over badly needed shots. Still, the European Union exported 34 million doses of coronavirus vaccines in recent weeks to dozens of countries, even as it faced shortages at home. As frustrations simmer, some European officials are blaming the United States. The European Council president, Charles Michel, said the United States, along with Britain, “have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory.” Asked Thursday about the U.S. supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters that vaccine manufacturers were free to export their products made in the United States while also fulfilling the terms of their contracts with the government. Because AstraZeneca’s vaccine was produced with help from the Defense Production Act, Biden has to approve shipments of doses overseas. Such a move could have huge negative political repercussions as long as Americans are still clamoring for shots. AstraZeneca is also likely to want liability protection for doses shipped overseas, like it would have in the United States if the vaccine is cleared. Meantime, regulators in the United States have been waiting for new AstraZeneca data, expected in the next few weeks, from a phase 3 trial that enrolled 32,000 participants mostly in the United States. AstraZeneca is not likely to report results from an early look at its data as other vaccine-makers have done. It will instead wait for more statistically meaningful results after trial participants have been monitored longer for side effects and more people in the vaccine and placebo groups may have gotten sick, federal officials said. Experts believe the vaccine is unlikely to carry a higher efficacy rate than the shot made by Johnson & Johnson, which uses a similar technology and requires only one dose. The potential for those results means that AstraZeneca’s vaccine might not have an obvious advantage in the United States over the vaccines currently authorized. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is easy to distribute and protects against severe disease and hospitalizations. The two-dose vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which use a different technology, have efficacy rates around 95%. Federal officials have also emphasized in the discussions that AstraZeneca’s vaccine should not be stored indefinitely in Ohio or Maryland since it, like all vaccines, has a limited shelf life. The vaccine can be kept at refrigerator temperatures for six months, and some countries are giving the two doses spaced up to three months apart — raising the risk that the doses could go bad if they sit too long. Biden is taking steps to ramp up vaccine production, and the administration may have more than 1 billion doses available by the end of this year, with most ready by summer. That is far more than are necessary to vaccinate the roughly 260 million adults in the United States or even the entire population, once children and adolescents become eligible for shots. Most recently, the administration has focused on Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine, brokering a deal to have pharmaceutical giant Merck manufacture and bottle the shot and announcing plans to secure 100 million additional doses. Before the Merck deal was announced, administration officials discussed whether Johnson & Johnson should take over AstraZeneca’s manufacturing space in Baltimore, which the company shares with Johnson & Johnson. The process of stopping the production of vaccines takes weeks. And because AstraZeneca has a contract with Emergent, the Maryland manufacturer, White House intervention would be difficult. The idea was dropped once the Merck partnership was sealed. The administration says it is increasing the supply to eventually vaccinate children and possibly to make booster doses or to guard against emerging variants that may be able to escape the protection conferred by some vaccines. But privately, two senior administration officials said that by helping Johnson & Johnson scale up with the Merck deal, the White House is laying the groundwork for the company to eventually make its vaccine available overseas.

His executive order allows county judges to reinstate anti-virus rules should hospitalizations surge.“Too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities; too many small-business owners have struggled to pay their bills,” the Republican governor said. “It is now time to open Texas 100%.”Abbott’s anti-pandemic measures have drawn the ire of his conservative electoral base, which saw them as government overreach, and may have wounded any presidential aspirations. He received 0% of the vote in a presidential straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference this past weekend.The move was immediately blasted by prominent Democrats as irresponsible and politically motivated.Economic Pain“This will kill Texans,” Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. “Our country’s infectious disease specialists have warned that we should not put our guard down even as we make progress towards vaccinations.”New Covid-19 cases in Texas dropped to a five-month low of 1,637 on Monday, state health department figures showed. Virus hospitalizations slipped to the smallest tally since Oct. 28.Earlier Tuesday, Abbott said in a tweet that Texas is administering more than 1 million Covid-19 vaccinations weekly.“Texans have mastered the daily habits to avoid getting Covid,” Abbott said.As of Sunday, none of the state’s 22 trauma-service areas had more than 15% of hospital capacity occupied by virus patients. The pandemic has claimed almost 43,000 Texans since it emerged in early 2020.“An irresponsible decision guided by political expedience and nothing else,” Houston City Controller Chris B. Brown said in a tweet. “Not only will this set us back in the battle against #COVID19 in the region, it will likely prolong the economic pain brought on by the pandemic.”(Adds reaction from state Democratic Party leader in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

And Again.', 'description': 'The routine things in Chris Long\'s life used to include biking 30 miles three times a week and taking courses toward a Ph.D. in eight-week sessions.But since getting sick with the coronavirus in March, Long, 54, has fallen into a distressing new cycle -- one that so far has landed him in the hospital seven times.Periodically since his initial five-day hospitalization, his lungs begin filling again; he starts coughing uncontrollably and runs a low fever. Roughly 18 days later, he spews up greenish-yellow fluid, signaling yet another bout of pneumonia.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesSoon, his oxygen levels drop and his heart rate accelerates to compensate, sending him to a hospital near his home in Clarkston, Michigan, for several days, sometimes in intensive care."This will never go away," he said, describing his worst fear. "This will be my going-forward for the foreseeable future."Nearly a year into the pandemic, it\'s clear that recovering from COVID-19\'s initial onslaught can be an arduous, uneven journey. Now, studies reveal that a significant subset of patients are having to return to hospitals, sometimes repeatedly, with complications triggered by the disease or by the body\'s efforts to defeat the virus.Even as vaccines give hope for stopping the spread of the virus, the surge of new cases portends repeated hospitalizations for more patients, taxing medical resources and turning some people\'s path to recovery into a Sisyphean odyssey that upends their lives."It\'s an urgent medical and public health question," said Dr. Girish Nadkarni, an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who, with another assistant professor, Dr. Anuradha Lala, is studying readmissions of COVID-19 patients.Data on rehospitalizations of coronavirus patients are incomplete, but early studies suggest that in the United States alone, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands could ultimately return to the hospital.A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 106,543 coronavirus patients initially hospitalized between March and July found that 1 in 11 was readmitted within two months of being discharged, with 1.6% of patients readmitted more than once.In another study of 1,775 coronavirus patients discharged from 132 VA hospitals in the pandemic\'s early months, nearly a fifth were rehospitalized within 60 days. More than 22% of them needed intensive care, and 7% required ventilators.And in a report on 1,250 patients discharged from 38 Michigan hospitals from mid-March to July, 15% were rehospitalized within 60 days.Recurring admissions don\'t just involve patients who were severely ill the first time around."Even if they had a very mild course, at least one-third have significant symptomology two to three months out," said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief of infectious diseases at Brown University\'s Warren Alpert Medical School and Lifespan hospitals, who co-wrote another report. "There is a wave of readmissions that is building, because at some point these people will say \'I\'m not well.\'"Many who are rehospitalized were vulnerable to serious symptoms because they were over 65 or had chronic conditions. But some younger and previously healthy people have returned to hospitals, too.When Becca Meyer, 31, of Paw Paw, Michigan, contracted the coronavirus in early March, she initially stayed home, nursing symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, fever, extreme fatigue and hallucinations that included visions of being attacked by a sponge in the shower.Meyer, a mother of four, eventually was hospitalized for a week in March and again in April. She was readmitted for an infection in August and for severe nausea in September, according to medical records, which labeled her condition "long haul COVID-19."Because she couldn\'t hold down food, doctors discharged her with a nasal feeding tube connected to protein-and-electrolyte formula on a pole, which, she said, "I\'m supposed to be attached to 20 hours a day."Feeding tube issues required hospitalization for nearly three weeks in October and a week in December. She has been unable to resume her job in customer service, spent the summer using a walker, and has had a home health nurse for weeks."It\'s been a roller coaster since March and I\'m now in the downswing of it, where I\'m back to being in bed all the time and not being able to eat much, coughing a lot more, having more chest pain," she said.Readmissions strain hospital resources, and returning patients may be exposed to new infections or develop muscle atrophy from being bedridden. Long and Meyer said they contracted the bacterial infection C. difficile during rehospitalizations."Readmissions have been associated, even before COVID, with worse patient outcomes," Mylonakis said.Some research suggests implications for hospitals currently overwhelmed with cases. A Mount Sinai Hospital study of New York\'s first wave found that patients with shorter initial stays and those not sick enough for intensive care were more likely to return within two weeks.Lala, who co-wrote the study, said the thinking at overstretched hospitals was "we have a lack of resources, so if the patients are stable get them home." But, she added, "the fact that length of stay was indeed shorter for those patients who return is begging the question of: Were we kicking these people out the door too soon?"Many rehospitalized patients have respiratory problems, but some have blood clots, heart trouble, sepsis, gastrointestinal symptoms or other issues, doctors report. Some have neurological symptoms like brain fog, "a clear cognitive issue that is evident when they get readmitted," said Dr. Vineet Chopra, chief of hospital medicine at the University of Michigan, who co-wrote the Michigan study. "It is there, and it is real."Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, said causes of readmissions vary."Sometimes there\'s a lot of push to get patients out of the hospital, and they want to get out of the hospital and sometimes they\'re not ready," so they return, she said. But some appropriately discharged patients develop additional problems or return to hospitals because they lack affordable outpatient care.Long\'s ordeal began on March 9. "I couldn\'t stand up without falling over," he said.His primary physician, Dr. Benjamin Diaczok, immediately told him to call an ambulance."I crawled out to the front door," recalled Long. He was barefoot and remembers sticking out his arm to prop open the door for the ambulance crew, who found him facedown.He awoke three days later, in the hospital, when he accidentally pulled out the tubes to the ventilator he had been hooked up to. After two more days, he had stabilized enough to return to the apartment where he lives alone, an hour north of Detroit.Long had some previous health issues, including blood clots in his lungs and legs several years ago and an irregular heartbeat requiring an implanted heart monitor in 2018. Still, before COVID-19, he was "very high-functioning, very energetic," Diaczok said.Now, Long said: "I\'ve got scarred lungs, pulmonary fibrosis, and I\'m running right around 75-80% lung capacity."He was rehospitalized in April, May, June, July, August and September, requiring oxygen and intravenous antibiotics, potassium and magnesium."Something must have happened to his lungs that is making them more prone for this," Diaczok said.Long, a former consultant on tank systems for the military, is also experiencing brain fog that has forced a hiatus from classes toward a Ph.D. in business convergence strategy."I read 10 pages in one of my textbooks and then five minutes later, after a phone call, I can\'t remember what I read," he said."It\'s horrible," Diaczok said. "This is a man that thinks for a living, and he can\'t do his job."And his heart arrhythmia, controlled since 2018, has resurfaced. Unless Long, who is 6-foot-7, sleeps at an incline on his couch, his heart skips beats, causing his monitor to prompt middle-of-the-night calls from his doctor\'s office. Unable to lie in bed, "I don\'t sleep through the night."Small exertions -- "just to stand up to go do the dishes" -- are exhausting. In July, he tried starting physical therapy but was told he wasn\'t ready.In August, he got up too fast, fell and "I was very confused," he recalled. During that hospital readmission, doctors noted "altered mental status" from dehydration and treated him for pneumonia and functional lung collapse.In late October, Long developed pneumonia again, but under Diaczok\'s guidance, managed at home with antibiotics.In December, when a pulmonologist administered a breathing test, "I couldn\'t make it six seconds," he said.Long repeatedly measures his temperature and pulse oxygen, and can feel in his chest when "trouble\'s coming," he said. Determined to recover, he tries to walk short distances. "Can I make it to take out the trash?" he\'ll ask himself. On a good day, he\'ll walk 8 feet to his mailbox."I\'m going to be around to walk my daughters down the aisle and see my grandkids," said Long, voice cracking. "I\'m not going to let this thing win."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '000cb4d336a95b9d788db690f7100d59', 'title': 'Why 530 Frozen Bodies Sit in a Brooklyn Warehouse', 'description': 'NEW YORK -- At the marine terminal in South Brooklyn this month, a sign that said "funeral director" pointed to the left of a vast warehouse just past the guard gate. A row of 53-foot refrigerated trailers, about 20 in all, sat in the black-tarred parking lot. Tucked past the fashionable furniture warehouses of Industry City and next to a crumbling pier building, the facility was quiet.New York City officials believe this little-known site will help them avoid a repeat of one of the most shocking tragedies of COVID-19\'s first wave: the crush of bodies that overwhelmed the city\'s capacity for dealing with the dead.The warehouses at the pier held about 570 bodies earlier this month, most of which have been there, frozen, for months, with room for hundreds more.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAs the virus surges across the country, states and cities have been ordering or using refrigerated trailers for excess morgue capacity after watching New York\'s example in the spring. In Texas, 10 trailers were delivered to El Paso in early November. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced recently that the state had 60 refrigerated trailers standing by as makeshift morgues.But no other city yet appears to have had a death surge so severe that bodies have had to be held for months on end.New York City experienced a harrowing wave of fatalities as it became the global epicenter of the virus in the spring, with 17,507 confirmed virus deaths between March 14 and June 18. At the peak of the pandemic in early April, about 800 people died in a single day.More than 135 refrigerated trailers were deployed to the streets around hospitals, in what became one of the most enduring images of the city\'s crisis. But that was not enough. Shelves were placed in the trailers, doubling their capacity, as funeral directors ran out of storage room. Cemeteries and crematories could not handle the load.One Brooklyn hospital resorted to using a forklift to lift shrouded bodies into its morgue trailer, and a funeral home was caught storing dozens of decomposing bodies in two U-Haul trucks and its visitation rooms.In an effort to ease the backlog, the medical examiner\'s office buried dozens of unclaimed bodies in early April at Hart Island, its potter\'s field. But a few weeks later, it pivoted by transforming the huge waterfront warehouse in South Brooklyn into a long-term freezer storage facility for the dead -- allowing overwhelmed families to hold off on retrieving bodies for months before a Hart Island burial would be considered."What they came up with, these freezer containers for long-term storage, I think is going to be the new expectation," said John Fudenberg, executive director of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners and the former coroner of Las Vegas. "They did it, they proved that it works, and I think it will be the wave of the future because it\'s a lot more socially acceptable and more sensitive than temporary burial."How to find somewhere safe to store hundreds of bodies for long stretches was one of the hardest lessons in the first wave of the crisis -- one that hospitals, funeral directors and the city medical examiner\'s office are reviewing as the second wave of COVID-19 grows in New York.Last week, officials said that public hospitals in the city had canceled elective surgeries in order to save space for the growing numbers of COVID patients. COVID-19 deaths in the city are averaging about 35 per day, up from an average of fewer than 10 per day in early November.For now, a repeat as severe as the spring appears unlikely, given improvements in care and the arrival of the vaccine, the medical examiner and hospital officials said recently. Hospitals are reporting that their internal morgues, which tend to hold an average of 15 bodies, were about 25% full in mid-December, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association, which tracks that data. Funeral directors are not yet reporting backlogs."In planning, we are always ready for the worst-case scenario, and I feel confident that we are ready for that," said Dr. Barbara Sampson, the city\'s chief medical examiner. "But my expectation is that we will not be in the kind of place that we were in the spring. I hope that with all my heart."Still, normally about 150 people a day die per day in the city, so adding even an extra 100 deaths a day as a result of COVID-19 is likely to stress the system, several funeral directors said."There\'s just a real sense of dread, this kind of pall hanging over us," said Patrick Kearns, who operates three funeral homes in Queens and one on Long Island and retained his own refrigerated trailer after the first wave, just in case. "We have spent a lot of time getting supplies and setting up facilities. The position we are in now is kind of anticipation."Over the last few months, the city has required each hospital to redraw its fatality management plans, designating surge staff for morgues, parking spots for multiple 53-foot trailers and teams to handle paperwork and counsel families. Some hospitals have prebuilt ramps to access the trailers, 100 of which now wait in depots. The medical examiner has distributed thousands of heavy-duty body bags.But the facility that will most make the difference in the event of mass casualties, Sampson and others said, is the marine terminal, a city-owned concrete expanse at the end of 39th Street in Sunset Park.After the Sept. 11 attacks, the city\'s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner sifted rubble for human remains at the pier\'s warehouses. This time, the medical examiner, with assistance from the federal government, reopened the site April 14 as a temporary disaster morgue for hospital deaths, days after announcing it would stop temporary burials of unclaimed bodies on Hart Island.Video captured by drones of mass graves being dug on the island in early April had shocked the city. Families, terrified of that fate, implored hospitals to keep bodies longer, increasing the crush there, hospital officials said.On April 28, the city opened the long-term freezer storage facility at the Brooklyn pier, which can hold at least 1,500 bodies. (The city declined to provide a precise capacity)."That was a real game changer," said Jenna Mandel-Ricci, co-author of a Greater New York Hospital Association report on fatality management that documented lessons learned in the crisis. "I hope that we don\'t need it, but knowing that it\'s there and knowing that it\'s part of the framework that has been built is incredibly comforting."At the peak of the crisis, federal disaster workers and the New York National Guard helped to process and store thousands of bodies at Disaster Morgue 4, as the marine terminal was named. By the end of May, the pier held a total of 2,137 bodies -- 1,468 in long-term storage and 669 in refrigerated trailers, the medical examiner\'s office said.As of Dec. 4, the city\'s facility at the marine terminal still held 529 bodies in long-term storage and 40 in refrigerated trailers. (The Wall Street Journal first reported that bodies were still being held at the facility.)The city has not set a time limit on how long a body can remain there, as long as there are discussions underway with the family for a final resting place. The service is free, Sampson said.She said that those held in long-term storage there in December were a mixture of COVID-19 and non-COVID fatalities, which have continued to arrive at the terminal since May. The site, she said, is alleviating the strain on her office\'s regular morgues, which can hold 900 bodies, and also provides a central place for funeral directors to retrieve remains.Burials at Hart Island have not stopped, however. This year, 2,225 adults have been buried in the city cemetery there, the most in decades, according to the city\'s Department of Correction. Now burials there take place either at family request or because the bodies remained unidentified or unclaimed after an investigation of roughly two months, the medical examiner said.Officials have made adjustments based on what they learned in the spring. During the first wave, shelves were placed inside the trailers at hospitals to double their storage capacity. But they were unstable and at risk of collapsing if the trailers were moved. So the city sent strike teams of National Guard and medical examiner staff to hospitals to collect more than 2,000 bodies and bring them to the pier.This time, the medical examiner has told hospitals not to install shelves so trailers can be towed full to the pier, increasing efficiency and decreasing the possibility that the city could lose track of a body."After what we have all been through, with losing jobs and losing loved ones, the only thing that could make all of this worse is if the OCME or the funeral director has the wrong decedent," Sampson said. "I will not allow that to happen."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

(NYSE: PFE)  received  the greenlight for its vaccine against the coronavirus, the Food and Drug Administration cleared a similar vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, from Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA).What Happened: The FDA authorized the emergency use of mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 in individuals 18 years and older, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biopharma said in a late Friday statement.It is the second vaccine candidate approved conditionally in the U.S. It belongs to the new class of vaccines called messenger RNA vaccines. It contain a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\' mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus\' distinctive "spike" protein. Once vaccinated, the body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease but triggers the immune system to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.The decision was in line with  expectations  following a positive FDA committee review that favored approval by a vote of 20-0, with one abstention.Deliveries to the U.S. government will begin immediately, the company said."We were able to create and manufacture the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in 11 months from sequence to authorization, while advancing clinical development with a Phase 1, Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 study of 30,000 participants," said Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, in a statement.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, "With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of COVID-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States each day."Related Link:  Sarepta, Amicus Top Biotech Picks Ahead Of Key Binary Events: Analyst The Logistics and Distribution:  Given Moderna\'s vaccine was covered under the U.S. government\'s Operation Warp Speed, the Department of Defense, along with the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will manage allocation and distribution of the vaccine in the U.S.Prioritization will be determined by the CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Moderna said.The company expects to deliver 20 million doses to the U.S. government by the end of the month, and have another 100 million to 125 million doses available globally by in the first quarter of 2021.

He�s been gearing up for his latest impeachment trial, he�s been deprived of many of his toys and privileges that came with the presidency, and he�s suffering from boredom. But he�s also been basking in the comfort of knowing that the Republican Party will�even today�continue to bend over backwards to please him.But some of his most hardcore associates and advisers, who egged Trump on and helped fuel his most dangerous or destructive attempts to subvert American democracy, aren�t doing so well. In the three months since the election was called for Joe Biden, most of the lawyers and MAGA enthusiasts who decided to play a consequential role in the ex-president�s efforts to overturn the Democratic nominee�s 2020 win (efforts that led directly to the Jan. 6 mob violence), have had their jobs or businesses shredded, their personal lives shaken, or their reputations irrevocably tarnished�all while Trump�s been relaxing and playing his rounds of golf in the Sunshine State.The ones who helped spearhead the most extreme chapters in the broader crusade to nullify the election outcome are now besieged by their own legal battles. Several of them have complained that friends aren�t talking to them anymore, or have huffed and fumed over Twitter banning them for life for spreading dangerous misinformation. Several of the Trump-allied attorneys are just trying to hold onto their law licenses, under calls for disbarment for their participation on the Team Trump efforts. Only two of these people responded to requests for comment on this story.Much of their current ruin came as a direct result of their decisions to become major players in Trump�s failed authoritarian endeavor to cling to power. All of them have refused to admit that Trump, in fact, lost fair and square. Of this band of MAGA allies (which most prominently included people like Rudy Giuliani, Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, Lin Wood, Jenna Ellis, Cleta Mitchell, John Eastman, and Peter Navarro), arguably none of them has lost more in the time since the election than Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and personal friend of the ex-president�s.When Trump was in power, Lindell served as Trump 2020�s Minnesota co-chair and as a big financial backer of several efforts to overturn Biden�s win. He was welcomed by Trump into the Oval Office in the very last days of the term to brief the then-leader of the free world on a stack of documents purporting to show evidence that China and other foreign nations somehow tipped the election to Biden. (One of the papers in that packet included a suggestion for declaring martial law to bar the Democratic president-elect from office.)Today, as many of his former compatriots have already given up the fight, Lindell has continued to be the truest of believers in the cause, refusing to move on despite losing business left and right. Last week, Lindell texted The Daily Beast that Mattress Firm, which he described as a �big bedding company... if not the biggest,� had �quit selling MyPillow, too,� following a trend of companies swearing off the pillow mogul�s products after his post-election activity. Last month, the MyPillow creator said he�d already gotten phone calls or notices from Bed Bath & Beyond, Wayfair, and Kohl�s that they�d decided to ditch his product line and halt their business relationship with the MAGA super-fan�s company.MyPillow Chief�s Apocalyptic Election Fraud Epic Falls FlatThis month, Lindell and his pillow company also suffered a similar fate to the 45th president of the United States: Twitter had taken action against their accounts for spreading pro-Trump conspiracy theories baselessly claiming a rigged election. �They took down MyPillow�s Twitter now! Attacks keep coming,� Lindell lamented to The Daily Beast.Lindell is still facing a possible lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, the election tech company that has sent warnings to various people in the Trump orbit and in conservative media, demanding retractions and public apologies for making widespread allegations that Dominion helped steal the 2020 election. Other Trump stalwarts who�ve been sent demand letters have backed off, immediately gone quiet, or sheepishly issued on-air correctives.But not Lindell.Instead, the pillow entrepreneur claims to have gone into hiding, surrounding himself with ex-Special Forces soldiers. On Friday, Lindell released �Absolute Proof,� a three-hour video premiering on the Trump-aligned One America News Network that he claims will prove the election was stolen from Trump. Lindell cast the video�s release in apocalyptic terms, claiming on a North Dakota radio show shortly before the Friday release that the �end times� await if his video doesn�t catch on with �all the marbles on the line,� and that �I\'m serious, this is biblical. This is Revelations. This is Mark of the Beast stuff. This is that vaccine and all that garbage."Down in Georgia, Lin Wood isn�t doing that much better. During the tumultuous Trump-Biden presidential transition, Lindell financially supported Wood�s legal work as he made a name for himself with his especially groundless, violence-endorsing assertions about the election. The then-president would repeatedly phone Wood in late 2020 to get updates on his latest moves in Georgia. But Wood�s operation, working in tandem with Powell, caused rampant anxiety among conservatives on Capitol Hill, inside the Trump administration, and in the campaign. Many Republican operatives and lawmakers still, in part, blame Wood for helping to blow the GOP�s chances in this year�s Georgia runoff, costing the party control of the U.S. Senate at the dawn of the Biden era.But in the time since he seemingly struck up a rapport with Trump, the now-former president has privately bad-mouthed Wood as a crank to close associates, according to two people who�ve heard Trump�s criticisms. Today, Wood�s Twitter account, too, has been taken away from him, and it�s not clear whether Wood will even get to remain a lawyer for much longer.Nick Sandmann, the former Covington Catholic student whose lawsuits against media outlets had turned Wood into a star with Trump supporters, dropped Wood as his attorney. Wood recently doxxed his own son, publishing his estranged adult son�s email address online and urging his fans to contact him about the �persecution� the elder Wood faced. The Georgia state bar wants Wood to undergo a mental evaluation if he�s going to retain his license to practice law, according to Wood�s posts on social networking app Telegram, and a private lawyers club in Atlanta warned Wood he could face expulsion if he doesn�t resign his membership. Now Wood, one of the most outspoken promoters of the claim that Democrats committed voter fraud in 2020, is reportedly under investigation himself for voting in Georgia after sending an email that suggested he has another residency in South Carolina.Among this Trumpian collective of would-be election-destroyers, Wood isn�t even the only one whose license to practice law is now under attack or scrutiny.Powell, Wood�s partner-in-mischief, was slammed last month by Detroit officials who said they want her stripped of her Michigan law license. �This lawsuit, and the lawsuits filed in the other states, are not just damaging to our democratic experiment, they are also deeply corrosive to the judicial process itself,� attorneys for the Motor City wrote to U.S. District Judge Linda Parker.Following the Jan. 6 riot in Washington�the day Giuliani spoke at the D.C. rally and called for �trial by combat��the New York State Bar Association moved to expel the once-celebrated New York City mayor, and laid some of the blame for the mob violence at his door. Giuliani, who was the ringleader of Trump�s official election-challenging legal �strike force,� decried the move as a �political act.�Lin Wood Says He Must Take Mental Exam to Keep Law LicenseAround the same time, Brad Hoylman, the Democratic chairman of the New York state Senate Judiciary Committee, delivered a formal request to have Trump�s personal lawyer�s license to practice law revoked due to his �participation and role in fomenting a violent insurrectionist attack.�And like so many in the former president�s good graces who promulgated the pro-Trump lies about the 2020 election, Powell and Giuliani are facing aggressive legal threats from voting tech companies. On Thursday, Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion suit against several Fox stars, Giuliani, and Powell. "We have no choice," Antonio Mugica, Smartmatic�s founder, told CNN. "The disinformation campaign that was launched against us is an obliterating one. For us, this is existential, and we have to take action."But after Biden�s Jan. 20 inauguration, Giuliani at least continued to have the ear of his client, still the Republican Party�s most popular figure, by far. According to two people familiar with the matter, Giuliani kept informally advising Trump on impeachment-trial strategy, even after it was made clear to the attorney that he wouldn�t be officially serving on the ex-president�s new legal defense for the February Senate proceedings.Other lawyers who worked for Trump during the disastrous presidential transition weren�t so lucky, having been used and discarded by the former president�s political operation, and today left without their other jobs.Early last month, The Washington Post first revealed that Cleta Mitchell was intimately involved with Trump�s scandalous pressure campaign to overturn Biden�s victory in Georgia. She had, mostly under the radar, risen to become Team Trump�s point person in the state, and was on the now-infamous conference call between the Republican president and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.Over many years, Mitchell had earned a reputation as one of the conservative legal universe�s heaviest hitters, and a top-tier campaign finance attorney for right-leaning activists and political candidates. She was a true star in the field. But when her involvement in Trump�s efforts were revealed in January, her high-powered law firm, Foley & Lardner LLP, released a statement claiming it was unaware of the extent of Mitchell�s pro-Trump activity, and said the firm was �concerned� and probing the matter. Shortly thereafter, Mitchell was out of the job.Trump�s New �Volunteer� Lawyer Specializes in Election B.S.In December, John Eastman represented Trump before the U.S. Supreme Court when few others�even longtime Trump attorneys�would do so. On the then-president�s behalf, Eastman�a Chapman University law professor who became an outrage-magnet during the 2020 election for openly questioning Sen. Kamala Harris�s citizenship and therefore eligibility to serve as Biden�s running mate�asked the Supreme Court to allow Trump to intervene in a Texas suit that sought to cancel Biden�s victory in four key states.This legal maneuver, predictably, went nowhere fast. For his time and service, Eastman was rewarded by Trump by having his name floated as a possible member of his legal team for the second Senate trial. Eastman also got a prime speaking slot at the D.C. rally that preceded the bloody riot on Capitol Hill. However, Eastman and Giuliani were soon barred from working on the team, with several top Trump advisers fearing the pair wasn�t serious enough and that they carried too much riot-related baggage with them.The week after the rioting, Eastman was forced to resign from Chapman, following mounting pressure on the university�s leadership. The separation was acrimonious enough that both Eastman and the university had to pledge not to sue one another. �Chapman and Dr. Eastman have agreed not to engage in legal actions of any kind, including any claim of defamation that may currently exist, as both parties move forward,� Chapman president Daniele Struppa said in a statement at the time.As for the rest, Jenna Ellis, one of the most gung-ho of Trump�s senior legal advisers, is no longer representing the former president. Starting in early December, she and other Trumpist lawyers suffered a sharp plunge in the frequency of appearances on Fox News and Fox Business, following legal threats made by the voting-tech companies. But at least she still has her job as special counsel for the socially conservative Thomas More Society, and hasn�t lost her Twitter account of nearly 800,000 followers. Nowadays, she can be found tweeting her continued support of the former president, broadsides against the Biden administration, and her thoughts on issues such as why conservative women are definitely �hotter.�Peter Navarro, President Trump�s top trade adviser in the White House who spent Trump�s final weeks in office compiling and promoting documents that falsely portrayed massive election fraud, is still trying to talk to his former boss�through the TV, at least. On Friday, Navarro appeared on Newsmax TV to urge Trump to once again upturn his legal team. "You get somebody like Matt Gaetz as your lead attorney instead of that stiff [Bruce Castor] you had on," Navarro recommended� before touting his own research. �Then you use the �Navarro Report� and other reports that have been put out as your exhibits A, B, C, and D.�With the Trump presidency in his rearview mirror, multiple close associates of Navarro say they aren�t sure what his next career move will be, as he�s so inextricably tied himself to his onetime boss.As for Michael Flynn, Trump�s first national security adviser, he never got his reinstatement or re-elevation in the Trump administration that he and the ex-president had once so desired. In late November, he did, however, finally get his pardon from Trump for his role in the Robert Mueller saga. But in return, Flynn failed to deliver on the authoritarian push to keep Biden out of power, and (thankfully) didn�t have enough powerful takers for his pitch for Trump to proclaim martial law or use the U.S. military to �re-run� the election in electorally crucial states. With his professional reputation in Washington and elsewhere dramatically diminished, he now has to settle for being a folk hero to QAnon kooks.Chris Wallace Pokes Holes in Rand Paul�s Impeachment DefenseDown in Palm Beach, Florida, where the twice-impeached 45th president of the United States is prepping with his team for the Senate trial, he�s sometimes letting his boredom with retirement show, even as he tries to project a state of contentment to the public and to his aides. Late last week, Trump�s lawyers and advisers rejected an invitation from House impeachment managers for the former commander in chief to testify. �The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding,� senior Trump adviser Jason Miller flatly told The Daily Beast.When Trump hasn�t been focusing on his upcoming trial, he�s been golfing. He�s still binging his right-wing media and cable-TV favorites, though even there he�s starting to lose close friends due to the election aftermath. On Friday, the staunchly Trumpy Fox Business announced it had canceled the show of its star, Lou Dobbs, a fervent supporter of the former president who for years also doubled as a key informal adviser to Trump. (Dobbs had been mentioned in Smartmatic�s $2.7 billion lawsuit the day prior.) After the news broke, Trump voiced his support for Dobbs in an official statement, but by Saturday, Dobbs was keeping mostly tight-lipped about the ouster, texting The Daily Beast, �Sorry. No comment at this time.�When Trump is not watching television or monitoring line-up developments, he still hasn�t bothered devoting an ounce of introspection on the massive body counts and the ravaged nation he left for others to clean up. �He doesn�t have regrets about it, none that I�ve heard,� said one Trump confidant. He�s been scribbling down potential disses and harangues at his political foes, insults that he now cannot tweet himself to the broader public. He�s dictated petulant remarks sent to the Hollywood elites at the Screen Actors Guild who don�t want him anymore.In recent days, Trump has been phoning close associates regularly about the next impeachment trial�as well as to gossip about Biden, media, the future, and other members of the GOP. His office has also been messaging friends and high-profile allies on his behalf, inviting them to visit him at Mar-a-Lago, according to two knowledgeable sources and written communications reviewed by The Daily Beast.Some individuals close to the ex-president say he�s started getting lonely and bored with his existence out of power, and misses being constantly surrounded by powerful sycophants and being the center of attention for the news media, U.S. politicos, and leaders abroad. But the ex-president is still living in luxury, and has been recently very confident about his continued standing and influence in the Republican Party and conservative movement.And he�s not the only veteran of the sprawling, anti-democratic effort to be sitting pretty in early 2021.Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne became one of the strangest characters of the last days of the Trump administration, visiting the White House in December, dressed in jeans and a hoodie, scarfing down meatballs, and bickering with Trump�s legal team and administration officials, as he, Flynn, and Powell together pitched the then-president on their democracy-thwarting schemes. But now, with Trump�s dream of overturning the 2020 election in tatters, Byrne appears to be doing comparatively okay�and is blaming just about everyone else for President Biden�s win, turning his blog into the digital burn book of the Trump post-campaign. �Almost every evening, and many early afternoons, Rudy was shit-faced,� Byrne blogged recently. �That, and his podcasts, were the only guarantees in Rudy�s life.� (Byrne declined to comment on this story, saying he wanted to finish his blog series first.)However thoroughly Byrne was dragging Giuliani and others for their alleged behavior, the Trump attorney didn�t seem to care too much. Asked on Saturday what he thought about Byrne bashing him, Giuliani simply replied to The Daily Beast, �So have you,� without further explaining how this news outlet had �trashed� him lately.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

{'_id': '01401484cf160134f40e8f8840517d81', 'title': 'Biden Team, Pushing Quick Stimulus Deal, Prepares for Renewed Recession', 'description': 'WASHINGTON -- Advisers to President-elect Joe Biden are planning for the increasing likelihood that the United States economy is headed for a "double-dip" recession early next year. They are pushing for Democratic leaders in Congress to reach a quick stimulus deal with Senate Republicans, even if it falls short of the larger package Democrats have been seeking, according to people familiar with the discussions.Until now, Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader, have insisted that Republicans agree to a spending bill of $2 trillion or more, while Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, wants a much smaller package. The resulting impasse has threatened to delay additional economic aid until after Biden\'s inauguration on Jan. 20.Many of the president-elect\'s advisers have become convinced that deteriorating economic conditions from the renewed surge in COVID-19 infections and the looming threat of millions of Americans losing jobless benefits in December amid a wave of evictions and foreclosures require more urgent action before year\'s end. That could mean moving at least part of the way toward McConnell\'s offer of a $500 billion package.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBut top Democrats remain publicly adamant that Republicans need to move closer to their opening offer of $2.4 trillion. Biden, Pelosi and Schumer have given no public indication of how much they are willing to scale back their ambitions in order to reach a deal with McConnell, arguing that the Republican leader has not been willing to compromise."The COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession will not end without our help," Pelosi and Schumer wrote in a letter this month, asking McConnell to resume negotiations. "It is essential that this bill have sufficient funding and delivers meaningful relief to the many Americans who are suffering."Biden\'s team is also considering a range of other policy options for fighting a renewed downturn and the prospect of rising unemployment when he takes office, according to the people familiar with his plans. Some of them, like a sweeping spending bill that includes all or large parts of his campaign proposals for infrastructure, could depend on Democrats winning Senate control in two special elections in Georgia in January.Others would not require Congress. Biden\'s aides have weighed having the president-elect announce in the coming weeks that he will sign executive orders on his first day in office extending moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures, and deferrals of some student loan payments that are set to expire at the end of the year, the people familiar with the discussions said. He could also announce that he will sign an order providing a more gradual schedule for repayment of payroll taxes that some employers, including the federal government, had deferred into 2021 under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump.Such orders could lessen or avoid an economic cliff of expiring protections for renters, homeowners and some borrowers, which experts fear could hasten an economic contraction.The Biden team is also exploring how to circumvent a last-minute move by the Trump administration to end Federal Reserve lending programs that have helped stabilize markets by requiring the central bank to return hundreds of billions of dollars to the Treasury Department, according to the people familiar with the discussions. One possibility would be for Biden\'s Treasury to reissue that money to the Fed under new parameters meant to encourage more aid to small and medium-sized businesses than previously supplied.But the most important measure could be quick congressional approval of a stimulus bill."There needs to be emergency assistance and aid during the lame-duck session to help families, to help small business," Jen Psaki, a Biden transition aide, said Friday before a meeting with Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Pelosi and Schumer. "There\'s no more room for delay, and we need to move forward as quickly as possible."A readout from the meeting said Biden and the other Democrats "agreed that Congress needed to pass a bipartisan emergency aid package in the lame-duck session" but did not indicate what size package was warranted.The economy returned to growth in the second half of this year after falling into a sharp and rapid recession. But sluggish retail sales growth in October, rising claims for unemployment insurance last week and a multiweek decline in employment and hours worked at small businesses nationwide have increased the odds that the economy could tip back into recession."The pandemic is raging, and it\'s starting to do damage again," said Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody\'s Analytics.Economists close to Biden and his campaign are circulating a spreadsheet containing new projections from Zandi, which predict that the economy will begin to shrink again in the first half of next year unless lawmakers break a prolonged impasse in stimulus talks.Such a reversal would result in what economists call a double-dip recession, even as pharmaceutical companies prepare to distribute COVID-19 vaccines that lawmakers and economists hope will curb the pandemic and jolt the economy back toward rapid growth late next year or in 2022. Companies would shed 3 million jobs in the first half of 2021, Zandi projected, and the unemployment rate would climb from its current rate of 6.9% back to nearly 10%.Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was part of Biden\'s inner circle of economic aides in the campaign, said that "speed, size and composition are all important" in a stimulus agreement, "but speed is especially important."A dispute over the size of the package has stalled talks for months. Democrats have rejected multiple Senate Republican proposals -- the latest at about $500 billion -- as insufficient to address the economy\'s needs, particularly because they do not include money for state and local governments to plug budget holes and avoid public-sector layoffs. Zandi said that such a package "maybe barely gets you through to a vaccine" but risks running out when the economy still needs help.Several Republicans have expressed wariness about spending much more, revisiting concerns about the national debt and insisting that the economy is improving."We want to reach agreement on all the areas where compromise is well within reach, send hundreds of billions of dollars to urgent and uncontroversial programs, and let Washington argue over the rest later," McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor this week, deriding the Democratic offer. "By playing all-or-nothing hardball with a proposal this radical, our colleagues have thus far guaranteed that American workers and families get nothing at all."The legislative window before the start of the next Congress in January is quickly tightening, leaving many skeptical that a stimulus package could be passed before the end of the year. Most of the discussion around spending has centered on avoiding a government shutdown and approving the necessary dozen annual spending bills. About one week of scheduled legislative days remain, during which lawmakers will need to pass legislation to fund the government beyond Dec. 11. It is unclear whether either chamber will remain in Washington if that deadline is met, particularly when Capitol Hill is struggling to stem the spread of the coronavirus among the rank and file.Economists are increasingly stressing the need for lawmakers to act quickly, even if that means reaching agreement on smaller package. A bipartisan group convened by the Aspen Institute\'s Economic Strategy Group -- including former Treasury secretaries under Democratic and Republican administrations -- urged lawmakers Thursday to approve a package that includes aid to small businesses, individuals and state and local governments, saying the economy "cannot wait until 2021" for relief."What I\'m really worried about is the millions of people who are going to be without food or without a home during the winter," said Melissa S. Kearney, the economist who directs the strategy group. "That level of individual suffering, really, to me, should be everyone\'s priority and move them past their political differences."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The scheme was set up last year as a result of concerns that poorer nations would lose out as rich countries scrambled to secure COVID-19 vaccines for their citizens. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would be COVAX's second after AstraZeneca's. Details on the size of the deal or the price COVAX would pay were not immediately clear, but the sources said the allotment of doses would likely be relatively small.  One source says the limited doses are primarily meant for healthcare workers in COVAX countries. The Pfizer shot is also more complicated to transport and store, requiring ultra-cold freezers, which may not be practical for poorer countries with hot climates. Reuters reported Wednesday that the WHO plans to approve several more vaccines from Western and Chinese manufacturers in the coming weeks. In an updated forecast published on Thursday, COVAX said it planned to deliver nearly 2 billion doses to 92 countries this year, covering over a quarter of their populations. The COVAX scheme is set to start distributing COVID-19 vaccines next month. Ukraine said earlier on Thursday that its first delivery of some 210,000 doses under the COVAX scheme could arrive in the first half of February.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

This tied Trump\'s all-time lowest approval rating from Quinnipiac, as he also received a 33 percent approval rating in August 2017.This latest poll was conducted in the wake of Trump\'s supporters storming the Capitol building in a deadly riot, and found 56 percent of voters said they hold the president responsible for this, while 42 percent said they don\'t hold him responsible. Trump is now facing the prospect of a second impeachment, and 52 percent of voters in the poll said he should be removed from office, while 53 percent of voters said he should resign.Quinnipiac also found that 74 percent of voters believe that democracy in the United States is under threat, while only 21 percent said democracy is "alive and well" in the country."When it comes to whether American democracy is under threat, both Republicans and Democrats see a raging five-alarm fire, but clearly disagree on who started it," Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.Quinnipiac\'s poll was conducted by speaking to 1,239 registered voters over the phone nationwide from Jan. 7 through Jan. 10. The margin of error was 2.8 percentage points.

{'_id': '390d52dcecede45fe3b9b08a182e288f', 'title': 'In Thanksgiving Message, Trump Says ‘We’re Like a Third-World Country’ Because He Lost Election', 'description': 'In a surprise news conference on Thanksgiving Day, President Trump took questions from the press for the first time since losing re-election—but he doubled down on his “rigged” election claims and appeared to deny the reality that his presidency is ending, saying it will be “very hard” for him to concede to Joe Biden.“I think it’s not right he’s trying to pick a Cabinet,” Trump complained after railing against the supposed “massive fraud” that he claims gave Biden victory.Reiterating his claims of voter fraud in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia despite the fact that state authorities have already certified the election results in those states, Trump appeared to become combative when asked if he would concede if the Electoral College votes for Biden on Dec. 14: “It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede. Because we know there was massive fraud.”“Time isn’t on our side … this was a massive fraud, this should never take place in this country, we’re like a third-world country,” he said, suggesting that faulty vote-counting machines gave Biden millions of extra votes.Asked a second time if he would concede if the Electoral College votes for Biden, Trump responded, “Well if they do they made a mistake,” before saying it’s a “possibility” and scolding a reporter who pressed him on the issue: “Don’t talk to me that way, you’re just a lightweight.”Asked by another reporter if he would “leave this building” if the Electoral College elects Biden, he said, “Certainly, I will.”While Trump and his legal team have repeatedly looked to throw out votes in states that Joe Biden carried, none of their challenges have proved successful.Key states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia—all of which Trump carried in 2016, before flipping blue this year—certified their results this week, ensuring they will send a Democratic slate of voters to the Electoral College. Wisconsin and Arizona, two more states that flipped to Biden, are set to certify their results next week.“Massive fraud has been found. We’re like a third world country,” Trump said, before launching back into allegations of voter fraud that have been repeatedly rebuffed in court and by state election officials of both parties.“I did so well ... that they didn’t know what to do,” he said at one point of election results in Georgia, claiming that ballots for him were “thrown away.”“I don’t know what is going to happen. I know one thing, Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes. And I got 74 million but there were many ballots thrown away, so I got much more than that. But I got 74 million, 74 million is 11 million more than I got last time. … And it’s millions more than Hillary Clinton got.”Underneath all of the bravado, Trump at one point slipped up and blasted “the Biden administration,” apparently inadvertently recognizing Biden’s win.While Trump has refused to concede and maintained that somehow, he would win states he had already lost, his administration has relented behind the scenes.Earlier this week, Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administrations—a Trump appointee—signed off on a letter officially allowing the presidential transition to begin. Murphy had previously refused to do so, a partisan move from a historically non-partisan agency.Even Trump appeared to have a moment of clarity Thursday regarding a potential COVID-19 cure and his future (or lack thereof) in the White House.“Don’t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccine,” he said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': '8014ce21ac8ed33954d2bcbe8e0b59d5', 'title': 'To Stay or Go? Even With Vaccines, Travel Planning Remains Complicated', 'description': 'Kristin Botuchis booked the tickets last month, almost on impulse: two round-trip seats to London from Seattle for $1,200 in July — the perfect start to a dreamy European vacation that would include France, Italy and Greece. She found herself clicking through the Icelandic Air website and entering her information, “just to see what would happen.” “My husband was definitely caught off guard. He would never pick this time to travel,” she said, admitting she hadn’t done much research beforehand. “It was a little impulsive on my part.” Botuchis lives in Everett, Washington, with her husband and two children. She is turning 50 this year and celebrating her 20th wedding anniversary. She is also one of millions of Americans who, after a 2020 full of lockdowns and anxiety, are eager to get back to normal and back out into the world. But since that initial flush of possibility, of those daydreams of the French Riviera, Botuchis now worries that the pandemic realities of closed borders, quarantine requirements, uncertain vaccine access and her husband’s uneasiness will derail the trip from happening at all. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “I was trying to make this leap and make this dream trip happen,” she said. “But I started to realize that this may not be the trip I envisioned.” Welcome to the next phase of travel in a pandemic world: the post-vaccine era. Or maybe the mid-vaccine era is more accurate. Vaccine rollouts are bringing hope to travelers antsy to explore, as are scattered liftings of pandemic lockdowns nationally and around the world. But travel planning remains far from simple. Vaccine supply remains limited almost everywhere, distribution is confusing and questions remain regarding their efficacy in preventing transmission. Family members and friends may have different timelines for receiving a vaccine. On top of all that, news about the spread of variants is worrisome, and international travel remains head-scratchingly confusing with restrictions and testing requirements. (If Botuchis left tomorrow, she would not be able to enter France or Italy without proving an essential reason for her visit. Even if she opted to fly only to London, she would be required to quarantine for at least five days upon arrival.) And don’t forget that your favorite travel partner may have a different level of comfort regarding travel than you. Botuchis, who works with special-needs children, has already been vaccinated. Her husband, an industrial project manager, is not currently eligible. Taking a trip of any kind this summer might require her persuading him to take the risk, she said. “We both had COVID in November, but his case was much worse than mine,” she said. “He’s definitely more scared of the virus than I am. And he’s a little more cautious in general.” That, coupled with uncertainty around when he will receive a vaccine, makes her European trip a harder case for her to make. Vaccinated but Still Uncertain If the uncertainty of 2020 has taught us anything, it’s the unlikelihood that any travel that happens this year will be similar to the “normal” of pre-pandemic times. “Many of my colleagues in the travel industry are looking at the vaccine as a silver bullet to the situation,” said James Ferrara, president and co-founder of InteleTravel, a global host travel agency. “I don’t think that the science backs that yet.” Indeed, travel planning isn’t necessarily more straightforward for those who have already been vaccinated. Loren Riskin, an anesthesiologist based in San Francisco, was vaccinated in January. Riskin, 37, is largely basing her willingness to travel on the current state of the pandemic in California. “There’s some data to suggest that, if you’re vaccinated, you can still be an infectious carrier. And here in the Bay Area, we are still in a pretty dire place,” she said. “My travel plans, which right now are mostly daydreams, are much more based on what public health officials and leadership have said our system can tolerate, rather than my own direct risk.” (Currently, California’s state directives encourage residents to avoid nonessential travel and to self-quarantine for 10 days upon returning home.) Bill Jirsa and his wife, of Georgetown, Texas, are both fully vaccinated. Last fall, optimistic about the announcement of viable vaccines, Jirsa, 79, rebooked a land tour of Sicily, originally scheduled in 2020, for May. He also booked a cruise around the Caribbean and Brazil in the fall. Plus, there was an annual golf trip in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his brother and two friends. But receiving his second shot late last month didn’t provide the feeling of confidence and safety he had hoped for. “We’re just not comfortable with the current situation. Nobody can tell us that we can’t carry the virus and give it to someone else; no one knows for sure what the shots do with these new variants,” he said. “Nobody likes the unknown. So how can you plan when there’s so much you can’t plan for?” The couple has decided to, again, cancel all of their international travel plans, and received refunds for flights from Delta and Alitalia. Jirsa feels more comfortable with the idea of the Arizona golf trip, but his brother and friends are facing resistance from their families who have young children and are concerned about transmission of the virus. But the golf group is determined to play next year, if not this fall. “We don’t have that many years left when we are ambulatory, when we can do the kind of traveling that we like to do,” Jirsa said. “In 2022, we’re going to be 80 years old. I just don’t know what we’re going to be up for.” Hot Spots, Quarantines and Variants Vaccines are just one piece of the puzzle. Shifting hot spots and regularly changing state and country restrictions and testing requirements remain a concern for many would-be travelers. Stacey Burkert, who lives in Durham, North Carolina, her husband and their three teenage children traveled to Costa Rica in January — their first time flying since spring — in part because she felt less safe at home with the state’s rising case numbers. In Costa Rica, she and her family stayed in a villa that allowed them to be relatively isolated. Her children were able to continue remote schooling while away, too. The Burkerts are considering a family hiking trip in Europe this summer, but she’d like both the vaccine and more information before committing to those plans. “Even when I’m vaccinated, I’d still rather avoid areas that are a hot spot,” she said. “Our plans this summer will depend a lot on how Europe handles the virus.” Rebecca Williams, who lives in New York City, hopes to travel to Italy in August with her husband, daughter and newborn son. The trip had been canceled last year. Williams is 34 and her husband is 35; both are low-risk and will probably be one of the last groups vaccinated. While she is hopeful that they’ll be vaccinated by later this summer, she does not see the vaccine as a panacea. “Hopefully, we’ll be vaccinated. We’ll get a negative COVID test before we fly, and we’ll get one when we land if we need to,” she said. “We’ll rent a house so we have our own space; I imagine we’ll interact with the community less than we normally would.” For now, she’s looking at house rentals, but she plans on holding off on booking flights until this summer. With or without the vaccine, external factors mean that her long-awaited plans are far from certain. “We would have to cancel if a variant came out that was really dangerous for kids. Or if New York was in a state of lockdown. Or if a two-week quarantine was required at our destination; I’d have to reevaluate our timing.” It’s a lot. Not to mention that nonessential travel to Italy from the United States is currently prohibited. Changing rules around testing and mandatory quarantines have become something of a constant over the past year; now, there’s a possibility that either proof of vaccine or a vaccine passport could become a necessity. If travel planners learned anything in 2020, it is that the rapidity with which requirements can change, both state by state and country by country, can be dizzying. Botuchis expressed concern that, come summer, Americans will still be barred from entering much of the European Union without an essential reason. Even if she and her husband can enter the country, will quarantine requirements prevent them from actually seeing the place they’re visiting? And then there are changing requirements for reentering the United States. The latest virus hot spots seem to emerge just as quickly. An August trip to Italy — which is currently reporting tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases a day — might sound somewhat feasible now, but would quickly lose appeal if the country saw an even further surge. It’s a feeling of whiplash that Williams remembers all too well from 2020. “I remember saying last March, ‘Over my dead body will we cancel this trip! This will be over by Memorial Day!’” she said, referring to her 2020 travel plans. “Now, looking back on it, I can’t help but think, ‘Oh, Rebecca. Nope.’ ” Botuchis has a map pinned to her wall and guidebooks full of highlighted passages, but in the face of so much uncertainty, she has only booked that one round-trip flight to London. She hasn’t been able to bring herself to dig too deeply into cancellation and change policies. “If I’m not allowed in the country, they’ve got to give me my money back, right?” she said. “Or if they would give me a voucher so I could reschedule to next year … that would be OK.” Your Travel Plans: Subject to Change More flexible change policies may make it easier for some to pull the trigger and book, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s difficult to imagine what this summer will look like for travel. While it cannot be compared with the overwhelming loss of life and economic despair in the United States and elsewhere, the loss of travel over the past year has left a void for many. “We’re in a weird inflection point between the physical risks of a deadly disease and the mental risks of not being able to pursue the things you love,” Riskin said. The possibility of missing out on more adventures for an undefined period is a hard reality to consider. “I’m realizing how important travel, socializing and community really are,” Williams said. For Burkert, that uncertainty makes it incredibly difficult for her to even think too far ahead. “We used to plan our travel two years out. But I just have to keep the blinders on right now, because I can’t stand the letdown,” she said. “Even this Europe trip. It makes me nervous to talk about July! There’s this possible disappointment that I don’t want to deal with.” Riskin is heartened that numbers in California are steadily improving. The possibility of traveling further afield is a promise she’s holding onto to continue getting through a particularly challenging year. Her dream trip is a multiday scuba-diving trip on a boat, something that the vaccine at least allows her to consider again. But she’s not booking anything yet. “We need to rely on public health experts and epidemiologists and the people who have access to the bigger picture,” she said. “But as soon as they give me the go-ahead, I am going to go see some fish.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, with impaired breathing and drops in blood pressure that usually occur within minutes or even seconds after exposure to a food or medicine, or even a substance like latex to which the person is allergic.Both workers were treated and have recovered, the regulators said.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBritish authorities have since clarified their concerns, changing the wording from "severe allergic reactions" to specify that the vaccine should not be given to anyone who has ever had an anaphylactic reaction to a food, medicine or vaccine. That type of reaction to a vaccine is "very rare," they said.Their update also said that a third patient had a "possible allergic reaction" but did not describe it.Officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that because of the British cases they would require Pfizer to increase its monitoring for anaphylaxis and submit data on it once the vaccine comes into use. A panel of expert advisers to the FDA voted Thursday to recommend authorizing the vaccine for emergency use but also expressed concerns about the need to track anaphylaxis. The agency usually accepts the experts\' recommendations, and the authorization is expected within days. Vaccinations could start next week in the United States.The initial report on the British cases touched off alarm and confusion by advising that people who had ever had a "severe allergic reaction" to a food, drug or vaccine should not receive the vaccine. The nature of the reaction was not explained at first, leaving many people with allergies to food or bee stings wondering if the new vaccine would be safe for them.But the regulators\' subsequent clarification specified that their advice applied to people who had ever gone into anaphylaxis. It urged people with a "history of serious allergies" to discuss it with their doctors "prior to getting the jab."Authorities also said the shots should be given only in settings equipped to resuscitate patients if needed, by giving injections of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.What is known so far?The two health care workers in Britain had experienced anaphylaxis in the past because of food allergies, a Pfizer official said during the FDA meeting Thursday. Both carried EpiPen-type devices to inject themselves with epinephrine in case of such a reaction.They needed epinephrine to treat their reactions to the vaccine, and both recovered.British health authorities said they would continue to investigate. It is not known whether an ingredient in the vaccine caused the workers\' reactions.People with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine were excluded from Pfizer\'s studies, company officials said at the meeting Thursday.Among those who participated in the Pfizer trials, a very small number of people had allergic reactions. A document published by the FDA on Tuesday said that 0.63% of participants who received the vaccine reported potential allergic reactions, compared to 0.51% of people who received a placebo.In Pfizer\'s late-stage clinical trial, one of the 18,801 participants who received the vaccine had an anaphylactic reaction, according to safety data published by the FDA on Tuesday. None in the placebo group did.If I have allergies, should I be concerned?Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading expert on infectious diseases, said Wednesday that the allergic reactions were concerning but most likely rare, the kind of effects that show up when a vaccine moves out of testing and into broader distribution."If I were a person that had an underlying allergic tendency, I might want to be prepared that I might get a reaction and therefore be ready to treat it," Fauci said, in a webcast moderated by Dr. Sanjay Gupta of CNN, sponsored by Harvard and The New England Journal of Medicine.Fauci acknowledged that the problem could turn out to affect a lot of people."That\'s one of the reasons why it\'s important to cover the waterfront with different vaccine platforms," he said, adding, "If in fact we do find out that there is a consistent issue of a certain subset of people like those with allergic reactions, you\'ll always have other vaccine platforms that you can use, and hopefully you will not see that with those other platforms."Should people with allergies avoid Pfizer\'s vaccine?Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the initial, broad recommendation in Britain mentioning severe allergic reactions seemed to be an overreaction that could needlessly scare many people away from a desperately needed vaccine in the middle of a raging pandemic.Millions of people in the United States are allergic to foods like eggs or peanuts, as well as medicines or bee stings, and have had reactions that were serious enough to lead doctors to advise them to carry epinephrine injectors. But that does not necessarily mean the vaccine is risky for them, he said. About 5% of children and 4% of adults in the United States have food allergies, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Fewer than 1 in 1 million recipients of other vaccines a year in the United States have an anaphylactic reaction, Offit said.Those reactions are treatable and much easier to control than a severe case of COVID-19, he said.Many people with allergies to foods, bee stings or medicines have received multiple vaccines without problems.As a member of the FDA advisory panel that met Thursday, Offit voted in favor of authorizing the Pfizer vaccine. But during the panel\'s discussion of allergic reactions, he said, "This issue is not going to die until we have better data."He said research should be done to find out whether an ingredient in the vaccine can cause allergic reactions and whether people with other allergies might be especially sensitive to it.Dr. Moncef Slaoui, head of the government\'s Operation Warp Speed program to develop vaccines, said Wednesday that he thought U.S. experts would also advise people who have had severe allergic reactions to avoid the vaccine until the cases in Britain were fully explained.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University, said, "I wish Dr. Slaoui hadn\'t gotten ahead of his skis."He said recommendations about who should or should not get the vaccine would be made by expert advisory panels to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will be meeting Friday and this weekend.Schaffner said it seemed unlikely that the main ingredient in Pfizer\'s vaccine, genetic material called mRNA, would cause an allergic reaction.Next week, the FDA\'s advisory panel will vote on whether to recommend authorizing a second coronavirus vaccine that uses mRNA, made by Moderna. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are similar but not identical: They use different types of fat particles, for instance, to coat the mRNA.Schaffner said he knew of no evidence that people with food allergies were more likely than anyone else to have a severe reaction to a vaccine."We\'ve dealt with allergies to all kinds of medicines and vaccines in medical practice, and we can do that in this circumstance also," Schaffner said. "Everybody needs to be trained to be able to deal with this and deal with it promptly. I think we can manage this."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'a5c2cb6b9835dbe4b579f402d2eb8b13', 'title': "Alaska Health Worker Had a Serious Allergic Reaction After Pfizer's Vaccine", 'description': 'WASHINGTON -- A health care worker in Alaska had a serious allergic reaction after getting Pfizer\'s coronavirus vaccine Tuesday, symptoms that emerged within minutes and required an overnight hospital stay.The middle-aged worker had no history of allergies but had an anaphylactic reaction that began 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, Alaska, a hospital official said. She experienced a rash over her face and torso, shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate.Dr. Lindy Jones, the hospital\'s emergency department medical director, said the worker was first given a shot of epinephrine, a standard treatment for severe allergic reactions. Her symptoms subsided but then reemerged, and she was treated with steroids and an epinephrine drip.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesWhen doctors tried to stop the drip, her symptoms reemerged yet again, so the woman was moved to the intensive care unit, observed throughout the night, then weaned off the drip early Wednesday morning, Jones said. He said the woman felt well, remained enthusiastic about the vaccine and was set to be discharged later Wednesday.Although the Pfizer vaccine was shown to be safe and about 95% effective in a clinical trial involving 44,000 participants, the Alaska case will likely intensify concerns about possible side effects. Experts described the woman\'s symptoms as potentially life-threatening and said that they may prompt calls for tighter guidelines to ensure that recipients are carefully monitored for adverse reactions.Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert and member of an outside advisory panel that recommended the Food and Drug Administration authorize the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use, said the appropriate precautions are already in place. For instance, he said, the requirement that recipients remain in place for 15 minutes after getting the vaccine helped ensure the woman was quickly treated."I don\'t think this means we should pause" vaccine distribution, he said. "Not at all." But he said researchers need to figure out "what component of the vaccine is causing this reaction."Dr. Jay Butler, a top infectious disease expert with the Centers for Disease Control, said the Alaska case showed the monitoring system works. The agency has recommended that the vaccine be administered in settings that have supplies, including oxygen and epinephrine, to manage anaphylactic reactions.Millions of Americans are in line to be inoculated with the Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year. As of Wednesday night, it was unclear how many Americans have received it. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, said that his department will be releasing that data "several days or maybe a week into this."The Alaska woman\'s reaction was believed to be similar to the anaphylactic reactions two health workers in Britain experienced after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last week. Like her, both recovered.Those cases are expected to come up Thursday, when FDA scientists are scheduled to meet with the agency\'s outside panel of experts to decide whether to recommend that regulators approve Moderna\'s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.Although Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are both based on the same type of technology and are similar in their ingredients, it is not clear whether an allergic reaction to one would occur with the other. Both consist of genetic material called mRNA encased in a bubble of oily molecules called lipids, although they use different combinations of lipids.Offit said in both vaccines, the bubbles are coated with a stabilizing molecule called polyethylene glycol that he considers a "leading contender" for triggering an allergic reaction. He stressed that more investigation is needed.Pfizer\'s trial did not find any serious adverse events caused by the vaccine, although many participants did experience aches, fevers and other side effects. The Alaska woman\'s reaction was assumed to be related to the vaccine because it occurred so quickly after the shot.A Pfizer spokesperson, Jerica Pitts, said that the company does not yet have all the details of the case but is working with local health authorities. The vaccine comes with information warning that medical treatment should be available in case of a rare anaphylactic event, she said. "We will closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed," Pitts said.After the workers in Britain fell ill, authorities there initially warned against giving the vaccines to anyone with a history of severe allergic reactions. They later clarified their concerns, changing the wording from "severe allergic reactions" to specify that the vaccine should not be given to anyone who has ever had an anaphylactic reaction to a food, medicine or vaccine. That type of reaction to a vaccine is "very rare," they said.Pfizer officials have said the two British people who had the reaction had a history of severe allergies. One, a 49-year-old woman, had a history of egg allergies. The other, a 40-year-old woman, had a history of allergies to several different medications. Both carried EpiPen-like devices to inject themselves with epinephrine in case of such a reaction.Pfizer has said that its vaccine does not contain egg ingredients.The British update also said that a third patient had a "possible allergic reaction" but did not describe it.In the United States, federal regulators issued a broad authorization for the vaccine Friday to adults 16 years and older. Health care providers were warned not to give the vaccine to anyone with a "known history of a severe allergic reaction" to any component of the vaccine, which they said was a standard warning for vaccines.But because of the British cases, FDA officials have said they would require Pfizer to increase its monitoring for anaphylaxis and submit data on it once the vaccine comes into use. Pfizer also said that the vaccine is recommended to be administered in settings that have access to equipment to manage anaphylaxis. Last weekend, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that people with serious allergies can be safely vaccinated with close monitoring for 30 minutes after receiving the shot.Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, with impaired breathing and drops in blood pressure that usually occur within minutes or even seconds after exposure to a food, medicine or even a substance like latex to which the person is allergic.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

"We cannot stay where we are."Richmond added that he would work to "create a demand in the country to make politicians work across the aisle and to work together."Hold your laughter for the apparent compromise: infrastructure. "The famous words are, there\'s no such thing as a Democratic bridge or a Republican bridge," Richmond noted.Republicans won\'t even agree to help stop the mass death, pain, and suffering Americans are facing from the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic. So I have a hard time believing they can be convinced to get excited about working on some bipartisan bridges any time in the near future. But it\'s clear that Joe Biden is committed to the promise he made in his victory speech after becoming president-elect."I will work to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify," Biden proclaimed. "I won\'t see red states and blue states, I will always see the United States." As for Trump supporters, Biden asked "let\'s give each other a chance."As cute as that line was when then-senatorial candidate Barack Obama first said it so many years ago, it\'s time for it to be retired. Obama sold that dream and the country responded with our current nightmare — one that, if left to the actions of most elected Republicans, would never end.In the weeks that have followed Biden\'s promise, GOP leadership rejected a resolution declaring Biden as the president-elect. (If you recall, they spent the entire election calling him a "socialist" while relentlessly attacking his son.) As for those Trump voters, only a quarter of Republicans recently polled accept the election results.It is fairly apparent that there will be no u-n-i-t-y in this country, yet Richmond announced this implausible position anyway.Days after he did, more than 120 of the 196 Republican members of the House of Representatives signed their names to an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit filed by the Texas attorney general that sought to overturn Joe Biden\'s victory in the presidential election and keep Donald Trump in office for a second term. Among them was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. When initially asked if he supported the lawsuit, McCarthy wouldn\'t answer, but colleagues later claimed that he was left off the original filing due to a "clerical error." This is someone who wants to be the next Speaker of the House, and in order to do so, he must appease Dear Leader\'s cult. Yet, McCarthy is the same person who recently attacked Nancy Pelosi, saying, "Her power is more important than anything else."Joining McCarthy was House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who defended his support for the suit Sunday in an interview with Fox News\' Chris Wallace. When asked, "Do you feel comfortable throwing out millions of votes of your fellow Americans?," Scalise claimed "nobody wants any votes thrown out." Wallace interrupted to point out the obvious: "That\'s what the lawsuit would have done, sir!"Scalise would not answer directly if he would accept Biden as the president-elect, only saying, "Let\'s let this legal process play itself out."These attempts to pervert democracy are shocking, but not necessarily surprising. Republicans have never shown much respect for democracy. Ask Black voters, and more recently, anyone trying to vote by mail in a swing state. Republicans have long won elections by suppressing the vote, but they keep upping the ante on their trickery. Twenty years ago it was the Supreme Court stopping the recounts in Florida, and this year it was purposely sabotaging the U.S. Postal Service during a pandemic. When that still isn\'t enough, Trump and the party base he controls now say screw the vote altogether.It is not hyperbolic to say that the opposition party of the president-elect is actively trafficking in seditious language. Nor is it wrong to worry that some of Trump\'s most extreme supporters, namely The Proud Boys, are ready to answer Trump\'s debate call as evidenced by the group roaming the streets of D.C. over the weekend in search of a fight. They will follow the lead of Trump, who himself declared on Fox News that he won\'t stop contesting the election.Their efforts will fail, as the Supreme Court summarily rejected the Texas lawsuit and Joe Biden has now been certified as the winner by the Electoral College, but the point remains: We are in so much more trouble right now.I don\'t expect Joe Biden to fan the flames by cursing out Trump, his supporters, and the GOP writ large. However, as much as Joe Biden longs for the days of "civility" and compromise, his goals ought to shift from unity and compromise with Republicans to salvaging whatever semblance of democracy America has left in spite of them. "I\'m confident that on the things that affect the national security and the fundamental economic necessity to keep people employed, to get people employed, to bring the economy back, there\'s plenty of room we can work," Biden said in a recent interview.There are many ways to go about such pursuits. Trying to find common cause with those who no longer believe in democracy at all is a waste of words, time, office space, and our tax dollars.More stories from theweek.com  Fauci: Americans without underlying conditions could get COVID-19 vaccine by late March, early April  Donald Trump\'s defeat is good.

That\'s more than twice the number of fatalities in India, the country reporting the second-highest number of cases in the world. And as the U.S. crosses that milestone - losing on average 800 people a day to virus - the pandemic here is not localised in one or two epicenters: it\'s smouldering across the nation. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb painted a grim picture. "The Northeast still is holding on to the gains that it achieved in driving down infections. But we\'re seeing infections starting to rise in the South as well. And you\'re definitely seeing a concentration of new infections in the Midwest. So that\'s- that\'s driving a lot of the growth and infections. But it\'s getting more distributed around the country." That\'s fueling fears that as cooler weather drives Americans indoors and flu season hits, new outbreaks could surpass the surge seen over the summer. Although new cases are down about 50% from the peak in July, the United States is still reporting on average nearly 40,000 new infections a day - the highest number in the developed world. "The United States has done really well." U.S. President Donald Trump continues to paint an optimistic picture of pandemic. "And I really do believe we\'re rounding the corner. And the vaccines are right there." His own heath officials, including the U.S. top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, disagree. "We need to be doing much better than we\'re doing that\'s for sure." The president is seeking re-election amid the health crisis. He\'s repeatedly claimed a vaccine could be available within weeks. The director of the Centers for Disease Control bluntly disagreed, saying he didn\'t see one widely available until the middle of next year. "I think we\'re probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter, 2021." CDC Director Robert Redfield has also warned that with flu season approaching,  Americans are in for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had,” citing concerns of a possible “twindemic” of COVID-19 cases and influenza overwhelming hospitals.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Struggling to cope with uncertainty? Homebound with your entire family and going berserk from too much chaos and no privacy? If you’ve felt any of these things in the past six months, experts say you might be a dog. Indeed, dogs are feeling the emotional impacts of coronavirus just like their owners are, and it may be changing the way they act.Welcome to Rabbit Hole, where we dive deep on the biggest story. It’s for Beast Inside members only. Join up today.For example, research published in The Journal of Pediatrics in June found that more children were visiting the ER as a result of dog bites since stay-at-home orders went into effect in March. The data out of Children's Hospital Colorado showed that the rate of hospitalizations for dog bites shot upward when lockdowns went into effect and remained abnormally high even as these orders began to relax over time.Cinnamon Dixon, associate professor of pediatrics at University of Colorado and an attending pediatrician at Children's Hospital Colorado, said that while the researchers didn’t have national data from this period, she doubted the findings would prove unique to Colorado. According to 2019 data shared by the United States Postal Service during their annual “Dog Bite Awareness Week” in June, the state doesn’t usually rank among even the top ten “dog bite states.”People, Do Not Take Your Dog’s Coronavirus Vaccine“The rate of dog bites increases in the summer, and increased dog bites happen when children have increased exposure to dogs,” Dixon, whose research focus is animal-human interaction and, specifically, dog bite prevention, told The Daily Beast. But she said it is notable—and in fact, “startling,”—that the measured increase was nearly three-fold, jumping from 4.7 for every 1,000 visits last April to 12 per 1,000 this year at the same time.“It’s multifactorial,” Dixon said, but she believes some of those factors involve dogs’ heightened stress right now—and central to that, the emotional link between dogs and their owners. The Secret Life of PetsDr. Stephanie Borns-Weil, an animal behaviorist and veterinarian at Tufts University, said that to understand dogs’ behavioral changes, one must first understand that, like humans, they have lots of feelings.“New research shows dogs and cats do have a rich emotional life,”\xa0 Borns-Weil told the Daily Beast. “They feel fear. They can be impulsive and reactive. They can be angry,” she said. “There’s still a lot of disagreement about whether they feel so-called secondary emotions like jealousy, but the primacy emotions like anxiety, certainly.”\xa0And as humans know, nearly half a year into a pandemic, it is a very anxious time.Last year, a new study found that emotions could be transferable between dogs and their owners, and that this phenomenon of positive or negative “emotional contagion” grows more intense the longer a relationship lasts. Other recent research found that humans and their dogs tend to sync their long-term stress levels, as determined by measuring the cortisol concentrations in the hair of study participants from a cohort of human-and-canine pairs.\xa0Beyond what we consider human emotions, dogs experience their own versions of mental illness, too, from OCD to PTSD. There are, of course, even pet psychiatrists to treat them, and while this niche industry has been slow on the telehealth uptake, some practitioners are providing visits outside the home to accommodate social distancing. Dog Tired“When you think about what it’s like to be a dog, they don’t really know what’s expected of them in the human world,” Borns-Weil said. “They get a routine, and their ability to function in the human world depends on knowing what that routine is. It’s quite a huge change for dogs—and for cats—having their schedules disrupted.”\xa0This stress can manifest in more subtle ways than a pediatric medical emergency: Borns-Weil is seeing “a whole range of behavioral issues” among the canine patients at her veterinary practice, from increased territorial barking to doggy depression.“There are some dogs and cats that really need downtime,” she said. “Nobody’s really thinking about whether the dog—who’s used to just having this time to themselves for resting—is really in the mood to play with the ball, or go for a five-mile walk, or get petted, much less get jumped on by toddlers who are usually at daycare.”She added that most dogs are not used to being “on call” 24/7, and this could lead to their becoming anxious, irritable, even depressed. On the flipside of the coin, she said there are just as many humans now struggling with their pets thinking their owners are ready to play all the time. “So,” she said, “what we get is a situation where both ends of the spectrum, the animals or the people are suffering from a lack of boundaries.”\xa0Borns-Weil said that much of how dogs feel is expressed in their behavior. They are social animals, she said, so if humans pay attention, they’ll see dogs are actually quite good at expressing their emotions.\xa0To mitigate the risk of dog bites—or to simply help boost a dog’s mental health and help them cope—she recommends finding ways to make sure a dog has access to periods of quiet and privacy, and a consistent schedule when it comes to quiet time versus walks versus play.\xa0Ultimately, she said, as with our human partners, if it doesn’t strain relationships, this trying time may actually help take human-pup relationships to the next level.“We are spending more time around them, we are becoming a lot more dependent on them, but we also have an opportunity to understand their worlds better.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

{'_id': '2b89a076bd2e03ddd42457d245a4c6c9', 'title': 'Dad Got the Vaccine, but No One Else Did -- Yet', 'description': 'On the morning of Dec. 16, the threat of a Virginia snowstorm canceled school for 7-year-old Alain Bell. He instead spent the morning scribbling a scowling face in black marker onto his father\'s newly vaccinated upper arm."It was his idea," Alain said over Zoom, pointing to his father, Dr. Taison Bell, 37, a critical care physician at UVA Health in Charlottesville. "I feel good that he\'s not going to get sick."Taison Bell\'s actual face was all smiles. Shortly after 2 p.m. on Dec. 15, he became the second person in his hospital to receive a dose of Pfizer\'s new coronavirus vaccine.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"I feel fine," he said. "But my right arm, if you were to interview it, is probably not excited about what\'s happened to it."His limb experienced a bit of swelling and soreness, nothing out of the ordinary for a vaccine. It was a sign that the injection was doing its job: instructing Bell\'s cells to churn out a protein called spike, which will teach his immune system to recognize and thwart the new coronavirus, should he ever encounter it. His second dose, scheduled for early January, will clinch the process.The shot introduced a microscopic shift that will have an outsize impact on his risk of getting COVID-19. But, Bell said, little else in his life will change until more of his community joins the vaccinated pool.Bell remains a relative rarity among the people he sees both inside and outside of work. His wife, Kristen, and their children, Alain and Ruby, are unlikely to be vaccinated before the spring or summer. They, like many others, will soon live in a home divided by the splinter-thin prick of a needle -- one person vaccinated, three not. They represent a liminal state that will persist for months nationwide, as the first people to be injected navigate a new coexistence with the vulnerable at home.Although the new vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at preventing people from developing symptomatic cases of COVID-19, little data exists on how well they can stop the spread of the virus, raising the possibility that vaccinated people, despite being much safer individually, could still pose a threat to those they love.For that reason, "we\'re still going to be taking all the same precautions," Kristen Bell said. "Our day-to-day isn\'t going to change for months, as the vaccines continue to get rolled out."That isn\'t always an easy decision. Laura Lombardo, 40, a respiratory therapist at UW Health University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, received her first shot on the afternoon of Dec. 21. She never worried about how she would tolerate the injection itself, which she said had saddled her with a sore arm and a headache -- mild side effects.But Lombardo, who is trying to conceive a second child, said she felt uneasy about the lack of data on the vaccine\'s effects on women who are pregnant or lactating. She decided to pause her fertility treatments a couple of months ago and most likely won\'t resume them for some time after her second injection.But after months of watching her patients, most of whom are children, battle the virus, Lombardo is sure the vaccine is worth it -- "a light at the end of the tunnel."It will probably be many months before the rest of Lombardo\'s family receives their own injections, and her 6-year-old daughter, Kaleena, is impatient for change. She feels "good" about her mother\'s getting vaccinated. But virtual schooling and months of distancing have taken a toll; with fresh-fallen snow carpeting their neighborhood, she misses being able to play with her friends. Vaccination for them, as for so many others, will not arrive as a lightning-fast fix but at a plodding slog that will stretch at least into the spring.Even families with multiple health workers at the front of the vaccination line are not yet ready to mingle. Jeanel and Mike Little, nurse practitioners at UVA Health, will both be fully vaccinated by the end of January. But the timeline is far murkier for their 7-month-old daughter, Ruby. Children have been largely absent from vaccine trials, and the virus appears to affect the very young in unusual, and understudied, ways."She has been the biggest variable for us," Mike Little said.They will continue to be vigilant about their own hygiene, knowing that they might still be able to transmit the virus, he said. Ruby started day care only in December and has yet to establish regular, in-person contact with any of her grandparents. But for everyone\'s sake, that will remain the case for now."Our families have not really met our baby," Jeanel Little said. "We won\'t loosen those restrictions in the near future; we still need to isolate her as much as possible."Public health experts have estimated that a majority of Americans, perhaps 70% to 80%, will need to have some degree of immunity to the virus for its spread to sputter and slow. Reaching that threshold will take time, effort and patience as scientists tackle hurdles, from strained supply chains to the deep-seated distrust of vaccines that pervades some populations.But even as vaccines find their way into more and more arms, scientists will continue to study their effects on the population at large, searching for signs of unexpected or rare side effects and monitoring whether the vaccine might curb the coronavirus\' ability to pass from person to person.Bell, of UVA Health, is treading cautiously with the unknowns. Perhaps the biggest is transmission, and whether the vaccine will help tame it. He said he suspected that the vaccine would have at least some impact on contagiousness. Once he is fully vaccinated, Bell might consider making the occasional masked visit to the gym -- a luxury he gave up months ago after finding his usual haunt overrun with people who had tossed their face coverings aside.Kristen Bell said her husband\'s vaccination had brought her hope and "a sense of relief -- it\'s nice to know he\'ll have some protection."But on other matters, the Bells stand firm. Before the pandemic, their son, Alain, would often greet his father at the door with a friendly tackle. That stopped in the spring. Bell plans to maintain his routine of discarding his work clothes and showering before engaging with his children.Alain, who intends on becoming a doctor himself -- ideally in outer space -- said he was impatient and excited for his own injection. "Most shots are fun," he said.But he has also begun to grapple with the pandemic\'s true toll. He once asked if he or his father might die of COVID-19. Taison Bell told his son, "I will try my best not to get infected."Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, 42, an infectious-disease physician at the Medical University of South Carolina, where she received her first dose of Pfizer\'s vaccine on Dec. 15, said she was giving herself one post-vaccination allowance: a trip home to California to visit her parents and her sister, who is due to give birth at the end of January."There\'s no way I was going to go if I wasn\'t getting the vaccine," she said.Because of the unknowns around transmission, she will still quarantine upon arrival, wear a mask and keep her distance from her parents, who are older and have health conditions that raise their risk of severe COVID-19.But Kuppalli, who lived with her parents in Palo Alto until August, has been living for four months in isolation in South Carolina, amid a pandemic that shuttered businesses all over town."Since January, COVID is all I\'ve eaten, slept and drank," she said. "And I\'m by myself. It\'s been a difficult transition."Her mother, Veena, was at first anxious to hear about the shot. Now that the first dose is done, with no serious side effects, she is relieved and eager for her daughter\'s arrival next month."We have always taken the precautions," she said. "I don\'t think there\'s going to be any difference."Kuppalli and others expressed some discomfort at being first in line for the vaccine, while so many others in the United States and beyond line up for their own shot at safety."I don\'t think guilt is the right word," she said.The system of tiers, recommended by government officials to prioritize those at highest risk, made scientific sense. But there was still immense privilege, she said, tucked into the tiny droplets of fluid that were pricked into her right arm this month.After nearly a year on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus, health workers are finally receiving a long-awaited coat of armor. It feels strange to wear it, they said, amid the many millions still left without their own chain mail.Manevone Philavong, 46, who has worked in environmental services at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Passavant for 21 years, was among the first in the nation to be vaccinated on the morning of Dec. 14.He long ago became accustomed to the risks posed by his line of work, which involves cleaning just about "every aspect of the hospital," he said. When he arrives home from work, he enters through the garage and disrobes in the basement before heading inside, where he lives with his mother and father, who are in their 80s, and a niece who is 30 and pregnant.Since the start of the pandemic, Philavong has tried to keep physical distance from his parents. They speak to each other from opposite sides of the living room. His father has had to work alone while tinkering with the family cars -- a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee and a 2009 Ford F-150 -- and tending the herbs and vegetables in the garden. This year, the family skipped their regular trip to Moraine State Park to fish for trout and bass.When Philavong told his parents about his injection, they were thrilled."They said, \'Now you can spend more time with us,\'" he said. "I said, \'Not quite yet.\'The vaccine provides "a layer of hope," Philavong said. "But I\'m still going to use every precaution I can."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Since lockdowns began in March 2020, people have been avoiding many of the things that make life worthwhile, including family gatherings, hugs, and dinners with friends. But now that Fauci is fully vaccinated, he said he\'s able to do something he hasn\'t done in a year. To see what Fauci, and any vaccinated person, can finally do after the jab, read on, and for more things you can do post-vaccination, Dr. Fauci Just Confirmed You Can Do This After Getting Vaccinated. Dr. Fauci is finally going to hug his daughter again. Fauci told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo on Feb. 25 that he can finally embrace his daughter again now that they\'re both fully vaccinated. "My professional judgment is that when my daughter wants to come in here, and she is doubly vaccinated, I’m going to have her over to the house, and I’m going to give her a big hug that I haven’t been able to do for a year," Fauci said. He encouraged others to get the shot when they\'re eligible so they can reap the same benefits themselves. And for more guidance from the infectious disease expert, Dr. Fauci Just Said Don\'t Take This Medication With the COVID Vaccine. Experts say it\'s safe for fully vaccinated people to gather. According to Fauci, two fully vaccinated people can gather with minimal risk involved. "What we\'re saying right now, even though it isn\'t backed by data—it\'s backed by common sense that if you have two vaccinated people and they want to get together, be they family members or friends that you know are vaccinated, you can start" seeing each other, he said.Fauci explained that while the risk is not zero, it "becomes extremely low when you have both parties vaccinated." And for more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter. Fauci believes increased freedom to do things safely will encourage people to get the vaccine. Cuomo pointed out that people are beginning to "get transactional" about the vaccine, wondering what\'s in it for them. But aside from protection from COVID, the vaccine will also provide people with more freedom, which Fauci thinks will help nudge them to get the shot."We\'re going to start seeing people saying, \'The more people get vaccinated, I could have dinner with my family member that comes in. I can go see my mother if she\'s vaccinated and I\'m vaccinated,\'" Fauci said. And for side effects to prepare for, Dr. Fauci Said He Had Pain in These 2 Places After the COVID Vaccine. We will continue to learn more benefits of vaccination. Fauci noted that when COVID vaccinations first began, there was limited data, so vaccinated people were encouraged to continue taking all the same precautions as those who were unvaccinated. This made some people feel like there weren\'t enough concrete benefits to getting the vaccine, he said.But Fauci believes that we\'re going to see a gradual increase in the things you\'ll be able to do "normal" again. "There will be a benefit both socially and personally and from a public health standpoint," he said.

As assurance, President Vladimir Putin said his daughter took the shot. But the early missteps on the vaccine’s announcement and rollout only added to what is now a looming problem: 45 percent of Russians are skeptical of Sputnik V.The public fear over the vaccine falls into several categories, experts say. Some see it as poorly researched and succumb to conspiracy theories. “Many don’t believe that authorities publish all the data or tell people the entire truth,” Alexander Ivanov, a research associate at Moscow’s Institute of Molecular Biology, said of the low public trust in an interview with The Daily Beast. “There are blank spots and questions for the research—but considering the spreading pandemic, 1.6 million victims, it makes sense to go forward with the mass vaccination, as soon as possible.”Intel: Putin’s Hillary Hackers Now After Our COVID-19 Vaccine SecretsMazalova did not listen to her doubtful friends and took a risk. She flew to Moscow to get her first shot in mid-October, as a volunteer in the trials. “On the first night after the shot my temperature came up to 38.1 (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and after the second shot almost a month later, I felt pain in my arm for a couple of days,” Mazalova told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “I stayed away from alcohol for a month, continued to wear a mask, distance myself in public places,” she said. A month after the shot, tests showed she had antibodies. “I am very happy I took part in the experiment, I am immune to COVID-19 now.”Sputnik V is available to Russian teachers, doctors, social workers and shop assistants as the frontline workers most exposed to the virus. Hundreds of thousands of doses of Sputnik V are being distributed around the country. It costs $20 for foreigners, while citizens can get jabbed for free. Putin said last week that he had not had the vaccine yet but will take it when it’s approved for people over 65.Nearly three million Russians have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. More than 47,000 people have died, according to the official data. Many Russian regions increasingly suffer from critical shortages of ventilators, oxygen and medicine supplies. St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city of 4.9 million, is currently experiencing the worst outbreak in the country; on Tuesday, there were only 27 open hospital beds left in the entire city for COVID-19 patients. During the month of December, the city has diagnosed nearly 4,000 new cases a day.Varvara Pakhomenko flew from Canada to her Siberian hometown of Tomsk as soon as she heard that both her mother and her stepfather were sick, and coughing. By early November hospitals did not admit patients in the city of about half a million inhabitants, so Pakhomenko, who had no medical education, turned her mother’s apartment into a ward for intensive care and even managed to find an oxygen machine to help her patients breathe at home. “I had no idea that the situation would turn to be so hellish: pharmacies had no paracetamol, no antibiotics, no vitamins, doctors would not show up for visits, hospitals had no spot to admit my family members, even when they were in a severe condition,” Parkhomenko told The Daily Beast. (Her parents have since almost recovered.)Hospital space is running out. In Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, authorities turned 34 clinics into COVID-19 wards. By early November, 89 percent of beds for infected patients were occupied. In many cases, patients had to wait for ambulances for an hour or longer. A young private doctor, Andrey Monakhov, has visited at home over 1,000 patients with coronavirus in the past few months. “The question is not whether you should or should not take the vaccine but rather whether it is going to help or not—I would say go and take it,” Monakhov told The Daily Beast.There are 70 clinics providing Sputnik V around Moscow. Authorities advise people to follow the quarantine rules, stay away from alcohol and be serious about supporting their immune systems during the 42 days after vaccination.A 67-year-old historian, Olga Fedorava, decided to risk it, simply because she could not live without seeing her students—as soon as the teacher had a chance, she took Sputnik V. “My nose was running after the first shot and I had a bit of fever after the second shot and a week later the test showed I had both antibodies and T-cell immunity,” Fedorova told The Daily Beast. “I still wear my mask in public places but I can now meet with my young students without much concern, which is important for my work.”Ivanov’s laboratory has been conducting tests for antibodies since April in search for donors of convalescent plasma for treatment of severe COVID-19 cases. It collaborated in studies of antibody-level persistence. “In the beginning of the pandemic we learned which medicine to use to treat severe symptoms of COVID-19, but now it is difficult to find these drugs in Moscow and especially in the regions,” she said. “That is the reason why I would recommend to have Sputnik V, especially to people with potential risks.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

It hit a peak of nearly 98,000 daily reported cases in mid-September, but then daily infections slowed this month.

India expects to roll out vaccines soon and is considering emergency-use requests for three types, developed by AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and local company Bharat Biotech.

{'_id': 'ad7d5f4d4a52edb28bf1e5fbe3012739', 'title': "Biden Wants Harris to Have a Major Role. What It Is Hasn't Been Defined.", 'description': 'WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden was rattling off a list of his priorities for a coronavirus relief bill in one of his first meetings with reporters as commander in chief when he stopped midsentence to correct himself. Those items, Biden said, are what “we think the priorities are,” putting the emphasis on the pronoun. Then, turning to face Vice President Kamala Harris, standing a few socially distanced feet behind him, he apologized. It was a rare slip for the president, who has worked to include Harris in nearly all his public appearances, and stress that she is a full partner in the decisions he makes. Those recurring scenes are the most tangible result of Biden’s efforts — and a presidential directive — to treat Harris, the first woman and Black vice president, as an equal stakeholder as he works to knit together the nation’s political rifts, address racial inequalities and bring the coronavirus pandemic to heel. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “The president has given us clear instructions,” Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, said in an interview. “Our goal is to get her out there as much as we can.” Harris’ relationship with the president was forged by the bare-knuckle politics of the Democratic primary campaign, when she emerged as one of Biden’s most vocal opponents. A surprising chemistry with Biden made them running mates and now that relationship will be crucial in enabling Harris to define herself in what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. said has proved “to be a job of spectacular and, I believe, incurable frustration.” “She went from this failed campaign to getting the golden ticket, as the chief surrogate for a guy who appreciates the role of vice president, and is going to put her out there in this historic role,” said Gil Duran, a former aide to Harris when she served as California attorney general. “So the question is: What does she do with this reset?” The answer is a work in progress. The vice president has already made her presence known, most recently Friday morning, when she traveled to Capitol Hill before sunrise to cast a tiebreaking vote in the Senate, clearing the way for Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package to move forward without Republican support. And as the barrier-breaking part of the partnership, Harris has assumed the burden of living up to the expectations of voters, especially people of color, who helped put Biden in the Oval Office. It is a burden Klain says she has borne “with grace” even as it weighs heavily on her. Others say it will take time for her to chart her own course. For now, the vice president’s staff advisers seem determined to cement and highlight her bond with Biden through their joint appearances, even as they seek to avoid letting Harris become a rigid, mannequinlike figure standing by the president’s side, much as Vice President Mike Pence did throughout the past four years. For a model, Harris needs to look no further than Biden. In eight years as vice president, he carved out his own role beside President Barack Obama, but not before overcoming a relationship that was, at first, stiff and formal. Biden and Harris are off to a faster start. They have spent far more time together than their predecessors — usually four to five hours a day in the White House, aides say — in part because the coronavirus pandemic has limited their travel. Harris and Biden usually begin the day receiving the President’s Daily Brief together in the Oval Office, a tradition reinstated since the departure of President Donald Trump, who had little interest in it. They also quickly embraced the idea of a weekly lunch in the White House as a private opportunity to build trust and share thoughts. In building her own staff, Harris selected people who she knew had good relationships with the president and his team. She chose Tina Flournoy, who has close ties to Klain, to run her office. Ashley Etienne, a former adviser to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is her communications director. Harris also knew that the president held Symone Sanders, who worked as press secretary to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign before joining the Biden campaign, in high regard. Symone Sanders is now her press secretary. Aides to the vice president repeatedly stressed that all of her public events and messages were closely coordinated with members of Biden’s team. A visit by Harris last week to the National Institutes of Health to thank scientists and receive her second dose of the coronavirus vaccine was paired with a speech later in the day by Biden in which he announced the acquisition of 200 million additional doses of the vaccine. That appearance made a lasting impression in the district of Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. In an interview, Beatty said that her phone lit up with calls from constituents who were newly curious about getting the vaccine themselves after photos of Harris receiving the shot hit the internet. Black Americans are nearly three times more likely to die from the coronavirus than white Americans, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but white Americans are more likely to receive the vaccine, in part because of systemic racism present in health care institutions. The sight of a Black woman receiving the vaccine, Beatty said, “gave people hope and gave people education.” Those moments, in which Harris connects with people around the country, are critical to any future she might have beyond the administration. But they are also in line with the messages that Biden hopes his vice president — as a woman, a minority and a generation younger — can deliver on behalf of his agenda. But, as Biden well knows, the more opportunities there are to carve out a separate identity as vice president, the more chances there are to make a mess. As vice president, Biden’s loquaciousness frequently caught the tightly scripted Obama White House off guard. At times, including in 2012 when he voiced support for gay marriage before Obama did, Biden would toss the script completely. When Harris sat for an interview last week with a West Virginia television station, her support for the president’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan was interpreted as an attempt to put pressure on the state’s Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, who took offense and expressed annoyance that he had not been given a heads-up. And in a minor flub during the same interview Harris promoted the clearing of “abandoned land mines” in West Virginia — not “abandoned mine lands” — as a job creation effort in the state. White House officials were quickly in touch with Manchin to do damage control, wallpapering over the flap by publicly praising Manchin’s value to the Biden-Harris agenda. Harris has also faced questions about members of her family profiting from their relationships with her. Reports that Harris’ stepdaughter received a modeling contract a week after Inauguration Day raised eyebrows even among the president’s allies. And a business run by Harris’ niece that sells Harris-themed merchandise has been an ethical issue for Biden’s aides since the campaign. The White House has said that her name will not be used for commercial activities that would “imply an endorsement or support,” according to a spokeswoman. That has not diminished the president’s view of Harris. White House officials said Biden was eager to put her to work, much the way Obama put him in charge of the economic recovery program in early 2009. But the fact that the president does not intend to assign her a specific portfolio immediately inevitably elicited some questions about her role in the administration. Biden has instead handed Harris a flurry of high-profile tasks in their first two weeks in office. Just hours after the president announced on Inauguration Day that the United States planned to rejoin the World Health Organization, the vice president was on the phone with Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the group, reaffirming the new administration’s support after Trump’s sustained attacks on the premier global health institution. The call sent an early message that she speaks for Biden on some of his most critical priorities, but Harris has not been shy about pressing Biden on her own. In the past weeks, aides to the president and vice president said she had repeatedly pushed for more focus on how the administration’s policies would affect less advantaged people in urban and rural communities that are often overlooked. During an Oval Office meeting with Biden and his advisers on their first Monday in the White House, Harris pressed Jeffrey D. Zients, the coronavirus response coordinator, to provide more detail about the use of mobile vaccination centers to ensure that poor people living in remote areas would be able to be protected against the virus. “The vice president pushed us hard, in a very good way, on are there enough mobile units available? As we wrapped up that meeting, she pushed me on, ‘Where we are on mobile vaccination units? How many are we going to have, in what period of time? Are they going to be able to reach rural communities and urban communities? How much progress have you made?’” Zients said. That kind of persistence has left a deep impression on Biden, his aides say. It was just hours after Harris peppered Zients with questions that the president caught himself taking sole credit for his coronavirus relief plan on the stage with Harris. Klain, who has served two vice presidents as chief of staff, said the instance was more evidence that Biden had an instinctual understanding of how those moments might feel. “She starts with a president who has been there and understands what it feels like to be the person standing behind two steps back at a public event,” Klain said. “I think he has this empathy for her situation that is unique.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 3}

Fauci also said that the more important question is when the U.S. could get enough of the population vaccinated to achieve herd immunity."At the end of the day, the real bottom line is, when do you get the overwhelming majority of the population vaccinated so you can get that umbrella of herd immunity?"

So when first doses began being doled out, the Trump administration held back matching second doses to make sure recipients would be fully protected against COVID-19. Amid a massive demand for more doses, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced earlier this week that the department would begin doling out those reserved doses to more people, saying increased production speed would make up for the soon-to-be-depleted reserve.But as officials soon learned, the federal government had stopped stockpiling second dose vaccines weeks ago, they tell the Post. Both first and second doses were instead taken right off the manufacturing line. That meant Azar\'s announcement reportedly released a stockpile that didn\'t exist. The U.S. had already reached its maximum distribution capacity, and new doses distributors were expecting next week weren\'t coming, the Post reports.HHS spokesperson Michael Pratt confirmed in an email to the Post that the last of the reserve had been taken out for shipment this weekend. He didn\'t acknowledge Azar\'s comments, but said Operation Warp Speed had "always intended to transition from holding second doses in reserve as manufacturing stabilizes and we gained confidence in the ability for a consistent flow of vaccines." he also said states had only ordered 75 percent of the vaccines available to them.

Biden noted that America is sharply divided, but said "I think the nation -- and I don\'t think I\'m kidding myself, I got criticized from the beginning for saying this -- I think the nation\'s looking for us to be united, much more united. We don\'t have to have this. Politics has become so, sort of, dirty and vicious and personal and mean and clenched fist instead of an open hand.

We won Georgia three times."Colbert pointed to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who, he noted, has said some really nice things about Biden. "Do you think you guys can patch it up and work together?" he asked. "Lindsey\'s been a personal disappointment, because I was a personal friend of his." Biden said. "But look, I think I can work with Republican leadership in the House and the Senate. I think we can get things done. And I think once this president is no longer in office, I think you\'re going to see his impact on the body politic fade, and a lot of these Republicans are going to feel they\'ve got much more room to run and cooperate.""Is there anything about your predecessor, the current president, that you could thank him for sincerely?" Colbert asked. Biden found one thing.Colbert showed a clip of his first sit-down with Biden, from The Colbert Report, in the opening segment. But the most famous interview he did with Biden was in 2015, when they bonded over loss and grief. Biden brought that up when Colbert asked him about the role a president can play in helping the U.S. process and mourn the loss of 300,000-plus people to COVID-19.

Caldwell\'s lawyer, Thomas Plofchan, wrote about his work history in a motion filed on Monday, which stated that because Caldwell has "been vetted and found numerous times as a person worthy of the trust and confidence of the United States government," he should be released from jail as he waits for his trial to start.

He denies being involved with the Oath Keepers, and Plofchan said Caldwell is a "100 percent disabled veteran," and because of his "physical limitation," could not have forced his way into a building. The charging documents show that during the attack, Caldwell received messages about lawmakers being "in the tunnels" under the Capitol.

Giuliani amended the campaign\'s court filing for a second time, seeking to put back in complaints Trump\'s previous legal team had removed Sunday about how close Trump\'s observers had been allowed during ballot counting. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had unanimously rejected that claim Tuesday, a decision the Trump new campaign\'s filing stridently criticized.Trump\'s campaign, Giuliani wrote, wants U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann to order that "the results of the 2020 presidential general election are defective and providing for the Pennsylvania General Assembly to choose Pennsylvania\'s electors," with the ultimate goal of "Trump being declared the winner of the legal votes cast in Pennsylvania in the 2020 general election, and, thus, the recipient of Pennsylvania\'s electors." Biden won 306 electoral votes, meaning that if Pennsylvania\'s 20 electors were somehow moved into Trump\'s column, he would still have more than the 270 he needs to become president. Trump\'s campaign continues to pursue losing lawsuits in several states, but since it hasn\'t been able to prove fraud and can\'t disqualify enough ballots to reverse any states, Trump and Giuliani are "pivoting instead to a goal that appears equally unattainable: delaying a final count long enough to cast doubt on Biden\'s decisive victory," The Washington Post reports.Stalling certification long enough so GOP lawmakers can pick electors "appears impossible," since "it is against the law in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin law gives no role to the legislature in choosing presidential electors, and there is little public will in other states to pursue such a path," the Post reports. "Behind the thin legal gambit is what several Trump advisers say is his real goal: sowing doubt in Biden\'s victory with the president\'s most ardent supporters," raising money for his new PAC, and "keeping alive his prospects for another presidential run in 2024."More stories from theweek.com  The class folly of canceling student loans  Let\'s appreciate how extraordinary the vaccines are  Donald Trump\'s future is a Prairie Home Companion', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': '64ea3d3c8a7aa1f5be4395e9e4889a46', 'title': 'A Few COVID Vaccine Recipients Developed a Rare Blood Disorder', 'description': 'One day after receiving her first dose of Moderna’s COVID vaccine, Luz Legaspi, 72, woke up with bruises on her arms and legs, and blisters that bled inside her mouth. She was hospitalized in New York City that day, Jan. 19, with a severe case of immune thrombocytopenia — a lack of platelets, a blood component essential for clotting. The same condition led to the death in January of Dr. Gregory Michael, 56, an obstetrician in Miami Beach whose symptoms appeared three days after he received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Treatments failed to restore his platelets, and after two weeks in the hospital he died from a brain hemorrhage. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times It is not known whether this blood disorder is related to the COVID vaccines. More than 31 million people in the United States have received at least one dose, and 36 similar cases had been reported to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS, by the end of January. The cases involved either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, the only two authorized so far for emergency use in the United States. But the reporting system shows only problems described by health care providers or patients after vaccination and does not indicate whether the shots actually caused the problems. Officials with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that they were looking into the reports, but that so far, rates of the condition in vaccinated people did not appear higher than the rates normally found in the U.S. population, so the cases could be coincidental. Overall, the vaccines are considered safe. A small number of severe allergic reactions have been reported, but they are treatable, and the rates are in line with those reported for other vaccines, regulators say. In a statement, Pfizer said: “We take reports of adverse events very seriously” and added that it was aware of thrombocytopenia cases in vaccine recipients. The statement also said: “We are collecting relevant information to share with the FDA. However, at this time, we have not been able to establish a causal association with our vaccine.” Moderna also provided a statement, which did not address the question of the platelet disorder but said the company “continuously monitors the safety of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine using all sources of data” and routinely shares safety information with regulators. Hematologists with expertise in treating immune thrombocytopenia said they suspected that the vaccine did play a role. But they said that cases after vaccination were likely to be exceedingly rare, possibly the result of an unknown predisposition in some people to react to the vaccine by developing an immune response that destroys their platelets. The disorder has occurred, rarely, in people who received other inoculations, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella one. “I think it is possible that there is an association,” Dr. James Bussel, a hematologist and professor emeritus at Weill Cornell Medicine who has written more than 300 scientific articles on the platelet disorder, said. “I’m assuming there’s something that made the people who developed thrombocytopenia susceptible, given what a tiny percentage of recipients they are.” He added: “Having it happen after a vaccine is well-known and has been seen with many other vaccines. Why it happens, we don’t know.” Bussel said it was important to share information about the cases, because severe thrombocytopenia can be serious, and physicians need to know how to treat it. Sometimes the condition resists standard therapies, and if very low platelet counts persist, the patient faces an increasing risk of severe bleeding and even brain hemorrhage. He and a colleague, Dr. Eun-Ju Lee, have submitted an article to a medical journal on 15 cases in COVID vaccine recipients they identified by searching the government’s database or by consulting with other physicians treating patients. The report provides information about treatments and urges doctors to report cases. It also notes that it is too soon to tell whether the affected patients will have lasting recoveries or recurrences of the platelet problem. A few of the patients had previously had platelet disorders or other autoimmune conditions that might have made them vulnerable, Bussel said. People can have low platelets without symptoms, and it is possible that in some, a vaccine reaction could drop the level further, to a point where it becomes apparent by causing bruises or bleeding, Bussel said. He has been a paid consultant to Pfizer, not on vaccines but for a drug for the platelet disorder. Dr. Jerry L. Spivak, an expert on blood disorders at Johns Hopkins University, also said the connection to the vaccine appeared real but predicted that cases would be exceedingly rare and called them “idiosyncratic,” perhaps related to underlying traits in individual patients. The cases are not a reason to avoid COVID vaccination, doctors say. The risk of serious illness from the coronavirus is much greater than the risk of developing this rare condition, and the vaccines are crucial for controlling the pandemic. Legaspi’s daughter said the last thing that she and her mother wanted to do was create fear of the COVID vaccines. Both women still believe strongly in the need for them, despite Legaspi’s illness, her daughter said. The daughter asked, at her employer’s request, that her name not be used. In its most common form, immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease that affects about 50,000 people in the United States, according to a support group for patients. The condition develops when the immune system attacks platelets or the cells that create them, for unknown reasons. It sometimes follows a viral illness, and can persist for months or become chronic and last for years. It is generally treatable. Professional groups have advised that patients with the disorder be vaccinated for COVID, but after consulting with their hematologists. Legaspi was strong and in good health before receiving the Moderna vaccine. But when she was admitted to the city hospital in Queens, New York, her platelet count was zero. Normal readings range from 150,000 to 450,000, and anything under 10,000 is considered very dangerous and in urgent need of treatment. Doctors ordered Legaspi to not even get out of bed without help, for fear that if she fell and injured herself she could hemorrhage. They began giving her the standard treatments, including platelet transfusions along with steroids and immune globulins meant to stop her immune system’s war on her platelets. Nothing worked. Her platelets would rise a bit and then crash again between treatments. As the days passed with no progress, Legaspi’s daughter, aware of Michael’s death, worried increasingly that her mother would suffer a brain hemorrhage. “I don’t think she understands she’s like a ticking bomb,” the daughter said in an interview Jan. 28, after her mother had been in the hospital for more than week with no improvement. “I don’t use the term. I don’t want to tell her that.” Legaspi, from the Philippines, speaks only some English but understood that her condition was serious, said the daughter. Bussel heard about her condition and, although he works at a different hospital, he called her doctor Jan. 28 and offered to consult on Legaspi’s care. He also contacted Michael’s family to ask what treatments he had received — partly as a way of finding out what had not worked. Michael’s death had come to public attention after his wife, Heidi Neckelmann, disclosed it on Facebook. Neckelmann said in a text, “I am glad that Dr. Bussel reached out to me. I told my story with the intention of helping those in the same or similar situation.” She added: “I hope that other people can now benefit with Dr. Bussel’s experience. I wish my Gregory had had that chance.” On Jan. 29, Bussel sent Legaspi’s physician, Dr. Niriksha Chandrani, an email labeled “my strong recommendations,” noting that he was “very afraid” Legaspi would have a brain hemorrhage and advising a different course of treatment. Chandrani, chief of oncology at Elmhurst, realized that Bussel was a leading authority on the platelet disorder, and she took his advice. She had spent several sleepless nights worrying about Legaspi. “I didn’t want her to die,” Chandrani said. A day later, Legaspi’s platelet count had reached 6,000: “slow but steady progress,” Bussel said. The next morning, it was 40,000, which took her out of the highest danger zone. Two days later, Feb. 1, it was 71,000. It is impossible to tell whether the new treatments worked, if the initial ones kicked in or if she recovered on her own. But Feb. 2, she went home from the hospital to the apartment in Queens that she shares with her daughter and 7-year-old grandson. On Feb. 4, her daughter said, Legaspi’s platelet count was 293,000. Another vaccine recipient, Sarah C., 48, a teacher in Arlington, Texas, received the Moderna vaccine Jan. 3. She asked that her full name not be used to protect her privacy. Two weeks later, she began to have heavy vaginal bleeding. After two days she saw her obstetrician, who ordered blood work and scheduled other tests. A few hours later, he called and urged her to go straight to the emergency room. He was stunned and hoped it was a lab error, but her blood count showed zero platelets. She had a checkup with completely normal blood-test results less than a week before being vaccinated. The reading of zero platelets was not a lab error. The results were confirmed in the emergency room, and doctors there also noticed red spots on her wrists and ankles, caused by hemorrhages under the skin. Sarah C. had seen the spots but ignored them. She spent four days in the hospital, receiving platelet transfusions, immune globulins and steroids to restore her platelet count. She described the experience as terrifying. “Especially when people say they’d never seen this before, that you could bleed out or hemorrhage,” she said. “That was the biggest concern, and just not knowing. The gentleman in Florida, he didn’t make it. Certainly the fear was there.” Even so, she said: “I’m all for the vaccine. I had a terrible horrible reaction and just hope people are aware of what to do if something happens, to watch for these symptoms and get help immediately.” If she had known enough to recognize the red spots and bleeding as danger signs, she said, she would have gone to the emergency room much sooner. Recently, she received a notice saying it was time for her second shot of the Moderna vaccine. Her doctors have said she could go ahead and take it, but she decided to wait, though she said she did want another dose. “I don’t know if I’ll do the same one,” she said. “Maybe a different one.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Then the Ground Shifted.', 'description': 'Robin Arnone, a part-time trainer before the coronavirus pandemic, hasn’t set foot in the Colosseum Gym in Columbia, Maryland, since the virus shut it down almost a year ago. The gym is open again, but she doesn’t need the work. Things are going gangbusters in her other job as a home appraiser, and she hasn’t looked back. For Julie Stark, one of Arnone’s best friends and a professional dog walker, things are not so rosy. With many clients stuck at home in the pandemic and taking care of their own pets, her services are no longer in demand. Instead of walking seven dogs each day, she now walks three. Stark has had to economize, eliminating dance and gymnastics classes for her children to save $350 a month. She doesn’t know when her clients will want her back, but it’s not something she discusses with Arnone. “We don’t talk about money,” Stark said. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It would be awkward if she were a dog walker and doing unbelievably well,” she added. “I’m happy for her.” And there is a lot in Arnone’s life to be happy about. She replaced her used Lexus with a new one last year, and in December she indulged herself with a $550 Dyson hair dryer. “It felt a little ridiculous,” she said of the purchase. “But I worked hard, and if there’s any year I’m going to do it, it’s this year.” Arnone and Stark are among the millions of friends who were on a relatively equal financial footing before last March — people who would have thought nothing of splitting the check on a night out — and now find themselves on vastly different trajectories. Lockdowns changed what Americans can do as well as what services they need, and in the process created divergent fates for many workers. The pandemic has wreaked havoc on many who were already struggling. Nearly 10 million fewer people have jobs, and some 26 million reported not always having enough to eat, according to Census Bureau data. For the 50% or so of the population that makes up the middle class — defined by Pew Research Center as having an income ranging from around $45,000 to $135,000 for a household of three — the toll has been uneven. Like a tornado, the pandemic can devastate one household and leave neighboring ones unscathed. Arnone’s world, in the Washington-Baltimore area, exemplifies that. The gym where she worked, the Colosseum, is owned by her friend Tim Gallagher. His monthly income at the gym is down 25 to 30%, and a quarter of the gym’s members have suspended their accounts. To save money, he has lowered the thermostat at home to 60 degrees from 65, and while his truck has more than 340,000 miles on it, he has no plans to replace it. “You just got to scrape along and gut it out,” he said. “We’re really struggling to get by.” But in Arnone’s other field, home appraising, her friends and colleagues are reaping rewards from the booming housing market, where January sales were up 23.7% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Ultralow mortgage rates have prompted a wave of refinancings, which require fresh appraisals. “I don’t have much to complain about,” said Traci Warner, a friend of Arnone’s and a home appraiser in Waldorf, Maryland, south of Washington. After her husband was laid off from his sales job in April, Warner’s work picked up the slack. It’s not that things are perfect, but unlike Gallagher, she does not feel that she is barely hanging on. This contrast is mirrored in the larger economy. Weekly unemployment claims by newly laid-off workers remain at historically elevated levels even as stock indexes reach record highs. Vaccines have arrived, but their slow rollout means it will be months before anything resembling normal activity can resume at restaurants, hotels, gyms, airports, malls and other businesses that depend on bringing people together. “It’s very uneven,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a forecasting and research group. “The recovery for the most vulnerable parts of the population will take years.” Not only are wages and salaries down for the hardest-hit segments of the workforce, he noted, but so are overall employment and participation in the labor force. At the very top, the gains have been staggering. In eight months after the pandemic hit the United States, the wealth of the country’s roughly 650 billionaires grew by $1 trillion, according to a November study by the Institute for Policy Studies and other progressive groups. That included a $70 billion lift for just one of those magnates: the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. White-collar employees, having emerged mostly unscathed from the sharp downturn in 2020, are looking forward to what they hope will be a robust recovery in 2021 once most people are vaccinated. Service workers, devastated by the idling of entire industries amid lockdowns and other restrictions, just want the pain to abate. The split was evident in the latest jobs report from the Labor Department. While professional and business services employment jumped by 97,000 in January, that job growth was almost entirely offset in the private sector by losses in the retail, leisure and hospitality industries, among others. So while lines at food banks lengthen, new Teslas dot parking lots, and there are waiting lists for Peloton machines so the most fortunate can keep up with their workouts from home. Peter Atwater, a lecturer in economics at the College of William & Mary, has popularized a term for this phenomenon: the K-shaped recovery. While one arm of the K ascends, the other is driving lower. “There’s an enormous divide in confidence,” he said. “And we buy and spend based on how we feel.” Janet Yellen, the newly confirmed Treasury secretary, extended the metaphor during her confirmation hearings. “We are living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built upon wealth, while working families fell farther and farther behind,” she said. Life on the Upside Arnone misses her days at the gym, especially spending time with clients. It is the first time since she was 15 that she hasn’t worked as a trainer, she said. But she is feeling pretty good otherwise. Before the pandemic, she would train people in the morning and shift to her real estate work in the afternoon. Now she rises at 6 a.m. to start writing up appraisals before hitting the road to visit as many as eight homes in a day. “I’ve declined a boatload of appraisal jobs,” she said. “I just didn’t have the time.” After typically handling 500 appraisals a year, she did 635 last year. She is paid by the banks that issue the mortgages, and last year, she estimates, she earned roughly $250,000 for her services, up from about $185,000 in previous years. She lives in Woodbine, Maryland, 25 miles west of Baltimore, and although she still thinks of herself as middle class, she said her nieces told her she was upper middle class; she concedes that they’re probably right. It’s a world away from the apartment where she grew up in Randallstown, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, as the child of a single mother. “Thinking back, I had no clue,” Arnone said. “I didn’t realize how much we didn’t have. If I wanted something, my mom would go without, but I didn’t have the nicest clothes or the name brands.” Maybe that’s why she feels a little ashamed of her good fortune when she sees news stories about long lines at food banks or other evidence of the pandemic’s economic woes. “When I throw out the veggies I never got to eat, my mother’s Catholic guilt weighs on me,” she said. Home appraisal is a boom-and-bust business, driven by the housing market’s cycles. But with interest rates near record lows, and new buyers shopping for houses while existing homeowners refinance, work is plentiful for now. Warner — Arnone’s friend and fellow home appraiser — traded in her Honda Accord, which had more than 300,000 miles on it, for a 2017 BMW X3, not long ago, and was able to go to the beach in Delaware with her family last summer. This month, they went skiing in Virginia. “Our finances are pretty good,” added Warner, 51. “The market has been amazing.” Arnone, by her own description, is a worrywart and had done her training work on the side to supplement her income. Now she doesn’t feel the need. “The gym was always my safe place, and it’s weird not seeing Tim and other friends — I miss them,” she said. “But I won’t lie. It’s nice to have more time and more flexibility.” The Long Wait for Normal A year ago, Stark felt things were going her way. Five years earlier, she started a business as a dog walker and pet sitter, after having been a veterinary technician. “It was perfect,” she said, until the pandemic arrived. Now her clients are home and can walk their dogs themselves. And the decline in travel leaves little need for pet sitters. “I’m holding out hope that my clients will need me again,” she said. She has been surviving with help from her parents, child support from her ex-husband and unemployment benefits. Stark has her hands full with her own pets in the meantime. She has two rescue dogs, Roxy and Luke, as well as two cats. Everyone, she adds, gets along. She did get one new client during the pandemic, but most of the so-called pandemic puppies adopted in the past 11 months are being walked by their owners or their children, she said. She isn’t sure whether her old clients will come back when the pandemic recedes or she will be walking the new dogs. Sometimes she thinks of returning to a 9-to-5 job outside the house. “Part of me just wants a stable job and a regular paycheck,” she said. It doesn’t seem realistic, though: With her two daughters, ages 10 and 14, in school remotely, she needs to be at home most of the time. “I’m just hoping things will return to normal,” she said. Government aid has been crucial for helping people like Stark and Gallagher weather the pandemic. And their reliance on it underscores why many economists believe more federal assistance is necessary, especially if the K-shaped recovery continues. “Political leaders and policymakers have a big role to play in getting that bottom leg of the K up,” Daco of Oxford Economics said. “They hold the key to a stronger labor-market recovery that is as inclusive as possible and will reduce the long-term damage to the economy.” Gallagher, the owner of the Colosseum Gym, recently applied for a second round of small-business loans. That, and forbearance from his landlord, should enable him to keep Colosseum open in the months ahead. Still, he is not expecting an imminent recovery. “I think it’s going to take till the end of the year,” he said. “We’re allowed to operate at 50% of capacity. But I don’t have to worry about 50% because everybody is scared to death to come in.” The warnings from Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, haven’t helped business, Gallagher added. “His COVID briefings are deadly to my gym,” he joked. “Every time he opens his mouth, another five or six people put their memberships on hold.” In the meantime, Gallagher’s decisions reflect the continuing economic pain. He has laid off most of his part-time employees. Normally, he and his wife would go out several times a week, but now one outing is the limit. “That’s a big splurge for us,” he said. They have also dropped premium channels from their cable service. At the gym, a popular gathering spot for hard-core weightlifters, the clanging of the machines has been replaced by background music and the whirring of the treadmills occupied by the most devoted exercisers. And public health officials have warned that high-intensity workout sessions at gyms can spread the coronavirus, potentially threatening Colosseum’s revival. Gallagher said there was little personal training going on. Maybe five or six guests are out on the floor while Gallagher keeps himself busy cleaning up and fixing equipment. Every so often, he signs up a new member, with dues running at $59 a month. He is confident that eventually — on the other side of the pandemic — people will want to come back to the gym. Not everyone, though. He is concerned that members who have fallen out of the gym habit may never return. “It’s going to take longer to make up for those memberships and get other people to join,” he said. “A few people will never want to go to the gym, or the movies or where there are crowds of people. It’s a shame.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Brazil's health authority said on Wednesday that although the volunteer had died, the trial would continue. So far 8,000 people have been given the first dose of the vaccine in six cities in Brazil, which is grappling with one of the world's worst outbreaks of the disease. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the volunteer who had died was likely to have been part of a control group that did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting that the volunteer was instead given a meningitis jab. Oxford University confirmed that testing would continue, adding that after careful assessment: 'There have been no concerns about the safety of the clinical trial.' But AstraZeneca declined to comment immediately. This follows a pause in the trials of the vaccine last month when a patient in the UK fell ill.

Temperatures over much of the state remained below freezing on Tuesday, and more ice and snow were expected through Thursday morning.Public health officials in Dallas, Houston, Austin, and other cities postponed planned vaccination events or individual appointments until at least the end of the week, saying the injections would restart once travel conditions were less dangerous. Officials in Hays County were focusing on second doses rescheduled for the end of the week at a local high school and pushing first doses to next week.“Local providers have postponed vaccine clinics because it is not safe for people to be out across much of Texas. Vaccination will resume as soon as conditions permit,” Van Deusen said. “I haven't heard of any public sites being open, but I guess there could be some isolated places where that's possible.”Reasons for closure ranged from lack of supply to utility issues, according to state and local health officials. That includes 85 large vaccination hubs and several hundred smaller providers across the state.One potential threat to supply already in Texas is the inability of the power grid to keep up with demand, which has resulted in rolling blackouts and outages across the state. Health officials have not reported any doses wasted so far, but those numbers will continue to come in throughout the week and offer “a clearer picture of the effects on vaccine storage in the coming days,” Van Deusen said.Hospitals and health departments “generally have backup power,” but small providers may not, Van Deusen said.“If they can’t store vaccine under the appropriate conditions, we’re asking them to transfer or administer it,” he said.The Pfizer vaccine can be stored under regular refrigeration (up to 47 degrees F) for up to five days before it needs ultra-cold storage; Moderna for 30 days.When the power went out at a Harris County facility storing 8,500 vaccines early Monday, officials sent most doses to local hospitals, universities, a local jail, and other facilities capable of storing and administering them to keep them from being wasted, said Rafael Lemaitre, spokesperson for County Judge Lina Hidalgo.The doses not allocated to the other facilities were put back into storage after manufacturers told them they could be saved, he said.“Nothing was wasted, nothing was thrown away,” he said.Most of the doses were administered Monday morning at the various sites, according to a report in the Houston Chronicle.Lemaitre said local hospitals are on the critical circuits run by CenterPoint Energy in Harris County and are safeguarded against rolling blackouts. They also have backup generators in the event of a weather-induced outage.“They know where the critical infrastructure is,” he said. “We have not heard any other indications that there is a threat of spoilage or a lack of refrigeration anywhere else. But we’re still in this, we’re expecting more severe weather tonight, so we’re monitoring it closely.”The Texas Tribune is a nonpartisan, nonprofit media organization that informs Texans—and engages with them—about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Researchers at Sheba Medical Centre gave one dose to 7,000 healthcare workers in January and found there was an 85 per cent reduction rate in Covid symptoms after 15-28 days, while overall infections - including asymptomatic cases - fell by 75 per cent. Prof Arnon Afek, the deputy director general at Sheba, said the studies vindicated the UK\'s approach where there is a significant time delay between the first and second dose, as it shows that the first dose offers strong protection. "This ground-breaking research supports the British government’s decision to begin inoculating its citizens with a single dose of the vaccine," he said. Prof Eyal Leshem, Director of Sheba\'s Institute for Travel & Tropical Medicine added: "This is the first study assessing effectiveness of a single vaccine dose in real life conditions and shows early effectiveness, even before the second dose was administered." Professor Neil Ferguson, a senior scientific adviser, told BBC\'s Today Programme that data on vaccine effectiveness and the speed in which infection, deaths and hospital cases were declining was "looking promising at the moment".

The shots not only will help protect the nation\'s elderly and infirm -- and the staff who care for them -- but they raise the prospect of ending the devastating isolation many residents have felt for months.Family members are hopeful that before too long, they will return to visiting parents and grandparents, aunts, uncles and other loved ones regularly again. We checked with experts on some common questions.Will restrictions on visiting be lifted soon?Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesProbably not in a big way. Restrictions vary by state, and the federal government\'s guidance on what it considers safe stands for now. They already allow visits under certain conditions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, recommended in September that outdoor visits with residents be allowed and indoor visits, too, if the facility has been free of cases for 14 days.Some medical experts have said that those guidelines are too lax and that visits should be severely restricted, even banned. However, some of these experts are now saying that the vaccine changes the equation, somewhat."Once all residents are vaccinated, it opens the door for loosening of restrictions," said Dr. Michael Wasserman, the immediate past president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine, a geriatrician and former executive at nursing home chains.To allow visits, Wasserman recommends all residents of a nursing home should be vaccinated (unless they have some condition or allergy that would discourage vaccination on medical grounds); all staff members should be vaccinated; the nursing home should have the ability to ensure that visitors test negative for the coronavirus and have been disciplined about wearing a mask in public settings.Is the vaccine safe and effective for old and frail residents of nursing homes?The clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine included people over 65, and results showed it to be safe and to work as well in older people as in younger ones."This vaccine has gone through testing and clinical trials to ensure it meets the highest safety standards. It also is safe to get if you already had the virus," says a campaign to encourage people to get the shots by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, a combined trade group representing nursing homes and assisted-living communities.The lead administrator for CMS, Seema Verma, reinforced the confidence in the shot for older patients, including those with health conditions, in a statement last week: "I urge states to prioritize nursing homes and vulnerable seniors in their distribution of the vaccine."The point is echoed by Dr. Sabine von Preyss-Friedman, chief medical officer of Avalon Health Care Group, which operates nursing homes, who said the new vaccines appear "safe and effective."If restrictions are eased, should I visit right away?The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both require two injections -- the initial shot and a booster three or four weeks later. Von Preyss-Friedman recommends waiting at least two weeks after the second shot to have a visit."You hope these vaccines work, but these are elderly patients," she said. "You want to err on the side of protection."She said that, ideally, the visitor would also be vaccinated as well. Since shots won\'t be widely available for a few months, it may be best to wait until you get your vaccine. Until then, she believes nursing homes should consider visits on a case-by-case basis.Would visitors still need to wear a mask?Absolutely, medical experts said. This is particularly true if they are not vaccinated, but even after they are vaccinated "until rates in the community go down," said Dr. Joshua Uy, a geriatrician and associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School and the medical director of Renaissance Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center, a nursing home in Philadelphia.Uy said that he hopes that the federal government would supply enough personal protective equipment so that all visitors and residents could be properly gowned for such visits.What is being done to encourage nursing home residents to get vaccinated?The combined nursing-home and assisted-living trade group has started a program aimed at helping nursing homes and other care facilities to explain to residents the essential need to get the vaccine. The campaign, getvaccinated, notes: "The elderly population has a much higher risk for getting very sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19. The vaccine has been shown to provide a great deal of protection against serious illness due to COVID-19."But the people they love most may have more effective persuasive powers. Families can help, Uy said, by encouraging their parents and grandparents in nursing homes to get vaccinated."The vaccine," he said, "is going to be our way out."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '7d8fe05a785ff6e728ef92952f4ca002', 'title': 'Plenty of Vaccines, but Not Enough Arms: A Warning Sign in Cherokee Nation', 'description': 'TAHLEQUAH, Okla. — As people across the United States jockey and wait to get vaccinated, a surprising problem is unfolding in the Cherokee Nation: plenty of shots, but not enough arms. “We’re running out of people to vaccinate,” said Brian Hail, who helps oversee the tribe’s vaccination efforts. He winced as he pulled up the day’s schedule one recent morning: Vaccinations were open to basically everyone across the reservation, but 823 appointments sat unclaimed. It is a side effect of early success, tribal health officials said. With many enthusiastic patients inoculated and new coronavirus infections at an ebb, the urgency for vaccines has gone distressingly quiet. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Now, the tribe is confronting what looms as a major hurdle for the entire country as vaccine supplies swell to meet demand: how to vaccinate everyone not eagerly lined up for a shot. It is a dizzying public health challenge that cuts across the country. It encompasses persuading skeptics, calling people who do not realize they are now eligible, and making vaccines accessible for homebound patients, overstretched working families and people in rural areas and minority communities. The Cherokee Nation has administered more than 33,000 doses at nine vaccination sites across its reservation, which spreads from cities through rural woodlands, cattle pastures and poultry farms in northeastern Oklahoma. After vaccinating health care workers, Cherokee-speaking elders and essential workers, the tribe opened appointments to anyone who qualifies, tribal member or not, living in its borders. Still, hundreds of slots have gone unfilled, health officials said. Cherokee-speaking vaccine schedulers hired to set up appointments are waiting for their phones to ring. “Those initial waves of people that really wanted and needed the vaccine — we worked through that,” said Hail, deputy executive director of external operations at Cherokee Nation Health Services. The tribe counts 141,000 citizens on the reservation and 380,000 worldwide. “We’re struggling to get people to come in.” Dennis Chewey, 60, gave his brother and sister the tribe’s vaccination hotline and urged them to call. Chewey’s wife was at high risk because of her job as a casino housekeeper, and he knew several people who had died, including a health worker who had helped him treat his diabetes. But none of them had called. “They’re leery of taking it,” Chewey said, a few minutes after he and his wife, Clara, got their second dose at the tribe’s gleaming new outpatient clinic. “They’re my family. I can’t make anybody do anything.” Public health teams across the country are refocusing their energy and resources on bringing vaccinations to people. They are plunging into New York neighborhoods to reach homebound people, and visiting rural communities where unreliable internet makes it difficult to sign up for appointments or log into vaccination websites. They are driving long dirt roads to reach families without the cars or gas money to visit vaccination clinics. The Navajo Nation, which says it has vaccinated roughly 70% of its citizens, sent public health workers into rural corners of the high desert to vaccinate as many as 5,000 people close to their homes. The Cherokee Nation is planning “strike teams” of nurses with single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The Osage Nation, in northeastern Oklahoma, is vaccinating about 200 people a day at a clinic that has the capacity to give 500 shots. It tried two mass vaccination events at its casinos, but the results were disappointing. So the tribe bought two 30-foot “medical RVs” that will roll into smaller towns like Hominy and Fairfax to reach the 30% to 40% of tribal elders and essential workers who did not volunteer to get vaccinated. It is a house-by-house campaign against misinformation and wariness, waged with long conversations and patience. “You kind of grind it out,” said Dr. Ronald Shaw, medical director of the 23,000-member Osage Nation. “We tried to remove every obstacle to people who were sitting on the fence.” The coronavirus has been particularly devastating for Indigenous communities. It has killed American Indians and Alaska Natives at nearly twice the rate of white people, and inflicted a cultural crisis by killing the elders who pass down language and traditional teachings. The economic toll of the pandemic has pummeled native economies already racked by high poverty and unemployment. The vaccine rollout in native communities has been a surprising source of strength, especially as vaccinations of other communities, such as Black and Hispanic Americans, continue to lag behind white populations. Working through the Indian Health Service and long-established networks of tribally run clinics, tribes are outpacing much of the country, already giving shots to healthy adults and eligible teenagers. Some have even thrown open the doors to nontribal members inside their borders. In all, about 1.1 million vaccines have been distributed through the Indian Health Service and 670,000 have been administered. Still, health care advocates said frustrating gaps remained. Many Indigenous people in big cities and areas without tribal health centers had struggled to find vaccines. Now, native health workers are desperately hoping to get through to people like Nora Birdtail, 64, one of a shrinking number of Cherokee-speaking elders. Their names are marked down in a leather notebook that was created to inscribe their importance to Cherokee heritage and culture. Today, the notebook is a register of loss — of at least 35 lives and numberless stories cut short by the virus. Even as hundreds of elders got vaccinated, Birdtail resisted. She is vulnerable to the coronavirus from a stroke. Her job as a teacher’s aide brings her into close contact with children at the Cherokee Immersion School, where in-person classes are expected to resume soon. But Birdtail is scared of getting vaccinated, largely because she once passed out after getting a penicillin shot years ago. The government’s legacy of medical malpractice in Indian Country — a history of coercive treatments, shoddy care, forced sterilizations and more — has also instilled a deep skepticism about taking a government-supported vaccine. “It made me think back to the Trail of Tears, how they all got sick,” Birdtail said. “I don’t trust it.” The number of Americans willing to get vaccinated has grown as people watch family and friends, politicians and Dolly Parton roll up their sleeves. But about 18% of American adults said they would probably not or definitely not get vaccinated, according to a recent survey by the Census Bureau. Nationwide, people’s embrace of the vaccine has split sharply on partisan lines, with a third of Republicans saying they would not take the vaccine and another 20% saying they were unsure, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll. Ten percent of Democrats said they would not take the vaccine. Across Cherokee Nation, people who jumped to get vaccinated said they wanted to protect themselves and, more important, safeguard their community, elders and children who are still not eligible to get shots. Those who hesitated said they still had too many questions — about the vaccines’ efficacy, side effects and the speed they made it to market. The three vaccines that have received emergency authorization in the United States have been shown to greatly reduce serious illnesses and deaths from the virus, and all went through layers of review by the government and outside scientists. But those assurances had yet to reach a trailer in the community of Dry Creek where Fred Walker, 65, has to haul his drinking water from a neighbor’s home. Walker is disabled and worries about the virus. But he has avoided the vaccine because he fears it could damage his health. He said no health workers had reached out to schedule an appointment or answer his questions. “Nobody’s said anything about it,” he said. Others just seemed to want a nudge. At a Walmart providing shots, unvaccinated shoppers said they were not so much opposed as just waiting. For more information. For a doctor’s recommendation. For more people to take it. Even in places where vaccine appointments abound, some people worry about stealing a spot. Shelldon Miggletto, a Cherokee citizen and economic development director for the 4,000-person town of Stilwell (“Strawberry Capital of the World”), has held off because he does not want to cut in front of someone with asthma or diabetes. Similar issues have cropped up in Alaska, where vaccine slots went unfilled because people did not realize they were eligible. The nurses who run the Cherokee Nation’s vaccination program are obsessed with how to reel in more people. They are planning to vaccinate eligible students at Sequoyah High School. There is talk of vaccinations at barbecues, and T-shirts for the newly vaccinated. The health service has called and sent out mass texts asking unvaccinated members whether they are willing to come in. One of those messages found Sherry Garrett, 68. She and her husband had harbored deep suspicions about the vaccine and had planned to refuse it. But then her sister died in July after what her family believes was an undiagnosed case of COVID-19 months earlier. Someone at Walmart coughed in Garrett’s face. And when a Cherokee health worker called to offer a slot, Garrett said she relented, and convinced her husband, Larry, to come along. As they sat in a half-empty monitoring area, waiting the requisite 15 minutes after Larry’s first dose, Garrett said she now saw getting the shot as part of who she was: “I’m Cherokee, so I have to do it.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Seven hours later, the United States reported more than 4,409 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, according to data collected by the COVID-19 Tracking Project.The Biden administration came into power with purpose and an extensive agenda to combat the coronavirus pandemic, but purpose and planning only gets you so far—particularly when the president’s team is only just now getting a clear picture of how badly the previous administration had managed the crisis.“What we’re inheriting from the Trump administration is so much worse than we could have imagined,” Jeff Zients, the Biden administration’s COVID-19 czar, said in a call with reporters Wednesday. “We don't have the visibility that we would hope to have into supply and allocations.”“I think we have to level-set expectations,” added Tom Frieden, the former director for the Centers for Disease Control in the Obama administration. “There are lots of things that an incoming administration can do on Day One, including speaking honestly about the pandemic.”The new administration is already behind, in part because the Trump administration was unprecedentedly hostile during the transition. The question now, however, is how Biden can get a handle on a raging pandemic when his team is already so far behind.The task at hand is enormous. More than 400,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. Every state, territory and the District of Columbia is in a state of emergency. The number of people infected with the virus who are now hospitalized is more than double the number reached during the spring and summer peaks.It’s not just the spread of the virus that the Biden team needs to tackle. Officials will also have to confront the disinformation and misinformation about the virus that has permeated all four corners of the country—where people still believe the virus is a hoax and that public health guidelines are too great of an imposition on their personal freedom to follow. But it’s unclear what power of persuasion the Biden administration will hold and if it will be enough to convince people to take the virus more seriously.“At least we won’t have a president that’s actively fighting those rules on national television,” one official working with the new Biden COVID-19 team said. 1297494723 U.S. President Joe Biden prepares to sign a series of executive orders at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office just hours after his inauguration on January 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. Biden became the 46th president of the United States earlier today during the ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Chip Somodevilla/Getty More urgently, Biden and his team will have to handle the growing frustration among states over the lack of a comprehensive vaccine-distribution program that enables them to inoculate their residents quickly. They will have to find a way to get states more vaccines needed to meet Americans’ growing demand for the shot.Biden’s COVID-19 team says the president will use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to ensure that health-care facilities have what they need for personal protective equipment and to continue to scale testing across the country. Officials say Biden will also use the act and “other legal authorities” for “raw materials to ensure that bottlenecks do not slow down [vaccine] production,” Zients said, specifically mentioned the production of syringes as critical to success.It’s still unclear exactly when the president will invoke the DPA, and if the administration will lean on the legal authority for the production of supplies other than vaccine syringes.“Making vaccines is not simple, and you can't cut any corners,” Frieden said. “We'll see if there's anything more that can be done.”Biden enters office as states across the country are grappling with massive vaccine shortages. Hospitals and pharmacies have begun to run out, forcing them to cancel first and second dose appointments. Officials in states such as California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New York, New Jersey, and Arizona this week called on the federal government to not only help facilitate the shipment of additional vaccines but to clearly communicate how many doses they should expect to receive in the coming days. They’ve received no answers, according to six state health officials, all of whom requested to remain anonymous to speak more freely about the issue.CDC Officials Urge Biden Team to Dump Palantir’s COVID Tracker Her State’s in a COVID Death Spiral. Biden Just Hired Her.Those officials said the Biden team has for weeks reached out to states to assuage their concerns about the lack of a cohesive and functioning vaccination distribution system. The Biden message to frustrated governors was simple: help is on the way. But as White House officials begin to strategize on how best to remedy the situation they are finding that the foundation on which the Trump administration built its vaccine distribution program is more flawed than previously understood, according to two individuals involved with vaccine planning. From the accounting to the way vaccines are allocated and scheduled for delivery—the system doesn’t allow for the quick movement of vaccines off the manufacturing line to state vaccine distribution points, those officials said. 1230601329 Health workers wait for patients to administer Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines at the opening of a new vaccination site at Corsi Houses in Harlem New York on January 15, 2021. - Pfizer expects lower coronavirus vaccine deliveries for a stretch beginning in late January in order to lift output later this winter and throughout 2021, the drugmaker said January 15. KENA BETANCUR/Getty The former Trump administration built out the vaccine distribution process within the confines of Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to fast-track a novel COVID-19 vaccine. In the first few months of its existence, Operation Warp Speed focused on development—creating the country’s first effective mRNA vaccine and supporting companies’ clinical trials. The distribution strategizing came later. Developed by the military, the plan was to have the federal government, specifically the military officials within Operation Warp Speed, lead the logistics part of the vaccine delivery. The military would not actually touch the vaccine but would instead coordinate the effort from the Pentagon.Part of that coordination required states using the Pentagon’s Tiberius system—a platform that allows local officials to input their orders and see when they will be receiving their next doses. States only had a few weeks to try out the Tiberius platform before the vaccine rollout began in December, officials said, and they were provided false projections on how many doses they would be receiving once the Pfizer vaccine became available.Two state health officials who spoke to The Daily Beast said they believe the Tiberius system is still not accurately updating and is miscounting either how many doses the companies have manufactured or how many have been allocated by the federal government. Those officials said they have yet to receive responses from federal officials about whether their most recent orders for Pfizer and Moderna jabs have been filled.Part of the confusion among states is how the newest Trump administration federal guidelines on vaccine distribution have impacted the manufacturing process. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with the Centers for Disease Control, recently released a new set of recommendations that allow states to hand out the vaccine more freely—to widen the population of who can receive the shot in the first wave. The federal government also said it would start to release doses it had originally held in reserve for second-shot dosing.The recommendations almost worked too well—they ramped up demand significantly. Now, states say they don’t have enough doses.“There were more than 12 million hits to a map of providers we posted yesterday so it is clear that many Pennsylvanians are eager to get the COVID-19 vaccine,” a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health. “Unfortunately, we do not have enough vaccine for everyone who wants it right now.”The policy centerpiece of Biden’s attempt to turn the tide on the pandemic—and the devastating economic consequences it has also wrought—is a $1.9 trillion relief package he rolled out a week ago. It calls not only for expanded unemployment help, small business aid, and $1,400 direct checks, but $350 billion in relief aid to state and local governments to boost testing and vaccine rollout, and $20 billion and $50 billion for separate vaccine and testing initiatives, respectively.But that proposal faces an uncertain environment on Capitol Hill—particularly the Senate, where Democrats now hold the tie-breaking vote and where an impeachment trial of Trump is expected to eat up at least a week of the upcoming legislative calendar. The president’s allies fear that the trial, combined with Biden’s urgent push to confirm members of the cabinet who will help enact his efforts to control the virus, could push passage of his trillion-dollar “rescue plan“ into late spring.Democratic senators, who largely agree with Biden’s assessment that their $900 billion December relief bill was merely a “down payment” for a more expansive follow-up, are anxious to see the Senate leap into action at a pivotal moment in the country’s struggle to control the virus.“It’s the top priority,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA). “My gut tells me we will do all we can to find a bipartisan accord on it. There are many pieces of the proposed package I think that will generate significant Republican support.”Biden’s transition has actively reached out to lawmakers in both parties to sell them on their plan; Kaine told The Daily Beast that the process will “really accelerate” now that Biden has been sworn in.With GOP support a must to reach the 60-vote threshold—otherwise, the legislation will be stripped down only to issues relating to government spending and revenues—the administration is making a point of courting Republicans inclined to support such a proposal. One of them, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), said as she left the inaugural ceremony on Wednesday that she had already gotten the Biden team’s pitch and a chance to directly ask them questions.“I got a pretty good walkthrough of their COVID proposal yesterday,” Murkowski told The Daily Beast. “It's going to require, I think, a fair amount of debate and consideration. But he's made it clear that this is his initial priority. I don't disagree with that. We've got an economy that's really been hurt, we've got a vaccine that needs to get distributed—we’ve got a lot of work to do.”A key Democratic vote, centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), told reporters on Wednesday that a bipartisan group of senators—the same cohort that pushed the last round of COVID relief out of a stalemate last year—is slated to meet with White House officials this weekend to talk about the economic side of their plan. 1230689861 Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. During today's inauguration ceremony Joe Biden becomes the 46th president of the United States. JONATHAN ERNST/Getty Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters he hoped that group could produce a counter-proposal, rejecting some parts of Biden’s plan—such as its raising of the federal minimum wage—out of hand.“There’s space for a deal,” he said.The willingness of senior Republicans to even contemplate a deal puts wind at Biden’s back—and justifies the prayer, invoked in his inaugural address, that a nation united in common purpose may be able to turn the tide against the virus.“We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,” Biden said. “And I promise you this, as the Bible says: ‘Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.’ We will get through this together.

{'_id': 'eaed63eb84152c5d7b14256a811c8c86', 'title': 'Donald Trump commits to leaving White House if Joe Biden wins Electoral College vote', 'description': 'Donald Trump admitted it was a "very hard thing to concede" electoral defeat but committed to leaving the White House if the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden, the Democrat president-elect as he attended a Thanksgiving event on Thursday. "It\'s going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud," Mr Trump said, refusing to say whether he would attend Mr Biden\'s inauguration in January. In the nearest he has come to a concession, Mr Trump said he would leave the White House if Mr Biden is certified the election winner by the Electoral College - the process by which presidents are elected - on December 14. However, Mr Trump appeared to suggest he still held hopes of retaining the presidency. Asked about his plans for his last Thanksgiving in the White House, the president told reporters that the occasion might be the “first one of a second term”. The president added there were "a lot of things happening between now and January 20th [inauguration day]" and the election results have a "long way" to go. "I know one thing Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes," he said. "The only way he got 80 million votes is through massive fraud." During his annual Thanksgiving call with US troops overseas, Mr Trump also claimed the US will begin delivering Covid-19 vaccines "next week and the week after" as he insisted the country had "rounded the curve" on the pandemic. "We are rounding the curve [on the virus]. The vaccines are being delivered - literally it will start next week and the week after," he said during his address. Mr Trump suggested that medical workers, other frontline staff and elderly people would be the first to receive the vaccinations. It is unclear which vaccine Mr Trump was referencing, or whether he was referring to a specific federal government policy for a vaccine distribution. Two US companies, Moderna and Pfizer, have so far announced that their vaccines are effective at protecting people against coronavirus. Earlier this week US government officials said the administration planned to distribute around 6.4 million doses of Pfizer\'s vaccine to Americans as soon as the jab received emergency approval from the federal government, expected to be around mid-December. Officials say that by the end of the year they expect to have enough doses of vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate around 20 million people. However, it is likely to be April before the vaccines are distributed to the wider American public. In his address on Thursday, Mr Trump praised the speed with which a vaccination had been created, saying "two companies already announced [successful vaccines]" adding that several others were "coming up soon". "Some people have called it a medical miracle," the president said adding that the hunt for a vaccination "could have taken four or five years".', 'num_of_covid': 1}

In the U.S. to date, over 49 million people have received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and over 24 million have received their second dose as well, according to the CDC. Despite promises of smooth and widespread vaccine distribution from the Trump administration in the fall of last year, the vast majority of vaccinations have only been administered under the direction of President Biden’s COVID-19 Task Force. And stories of people skipping the line, political favoritism, and wealthy individuals gaming the system continue to taint the process nationwide.Soon, though, with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on the way, anyone who wants to get a vaccine will (in theory) be able to get one—if their job and other circumstances permit. This, in turn, has led technocrats to recommend the use of vaccine passport apps to enable safe re-opening of public spaces by this summer. This isn’t the first time app-based solutions have been recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact-tracing apps first hit the digital marketplace by the summer of last year, yet have struggled to find their feet in part due to issues regarding privacy and surveillance—issues that vaccine passport apps share as well.Anti-Vaxxers Melt Down Over Vaccinated People Giving BloodHowever, concerns regarding privacy rights are not a luxury that all can afford, including the socioeconomically disadvantaged, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and refugees, and the formerly incarcerated—all of whom have historically been over-surveilled by the government. No matter the slew of assurances from tech giants, vaccine app adoption will continue to encounter hesitancy among marginalized communities where individuals have routinely been forced to renounce their right to privacy, often in order to qualify for government assistance or in the name of public safety. Ignoring this “poverty of privacy rights” means ignoring a sizable subset of the population who are less willing to give up what privacy they have left, less trusting of institutional authorities, and less likely to be afforded equitable healthcare to receive the vaccine in the first place.Equity in vaccine distribution is a major hurdle to achieving herd immunity—a hurdle even for those who are already eligible. Low-income communities, communities of color, and immigrants are thus far among the least likely to have received the vaccine, and yet have been more likely not only to get sick with COVID-19 but to die from it, too. Adequate access to health care remains a barrier, and the ability to schedule and show up for a vaccination appointment remains contingent on internet access, flexibility from employers, and reliable transportation.Additionally, vaccine hesitancy that exists in subsets of these communities is due both to a long history of systemic discrimination and abuse by medical institutions—such as the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee and forced sterilization of Black, Latina, and Indigeneous women across the country—and to ongoing disparities in quality of care for minority groups in health-care settings today. Misinformation campaigns by anti-vaxxers have also specifically targeted these communities, exacerbating the situation further.In response to such hesitancy, one might argue that uptake may improve if individuals are unable to participate in indoor activities, such as going to the grocery store or movie theater, without a vaccine passport app in hand. And such an argument wouldn’t be without precedent. For instance, SB-277 in California outlawed personal exemptions from vaccination requirements for entry into both private and public schools following the 2015 Disneyland measles outbreak. And under immigration laws, the Department of Homeland Security mandates that those entering the U.S. for the first time or current foreign nationals applying for residency must be vaccinated based on recommendations from the Department of Health and Human Services. Required immunization “cards” for commercial travel have also existed for quite some time, and the evolution to developing an “e-vaccination certificate” system for travel post-pandemic is unsurprising. Though vaccinated individuals currently receive a CDC-issued paper COVID-19 vaccine record, plans are already underway in the private sector to attempt a nationwide app for immunization status.Black Doctors Try to Get Through to Vaccine ResistersHowever, while the public may support some form of vaccination verification to enable safer participation in indoor activities, a recent survey by Brookings pointed to concern that apps have a higher potential for violations of privacy and civil liberties than paper cards, particularly since U.S. law does little to protect against discrimination based on proof of immunity. Additionally, not only would these apps face challenges in terms of varying enforcement mechanisms, e.g. entering a school versus a grocery store, but aforementioned hesitancy—with respect to both vaccination and app adoption—remains a major obstacle to overcome. Countering vaccine misinformation and distrust of public health authorities, as well as ensuring privacy protections, will be an ongoing battle. Furthermore, even those who want to use a vaccine passport app may not be able to because of limited access to smartphones.Ultimately, relying solely on vaccine passport apps to reopen society will translate primarily into privileged communities being afforded a return to normalcy. Such apps can be of use in very limited circumstances, like commercial air travel, but these efforts are essentially trivial to the more pressing consideration of vaccinating the general public equitably. The focus must remain on addressing the underlying concerns of marginalized communities by improving government engagement with community leaders to promote vaccine accessibility and uptake and providing alternatives to signing up for vaccine appointments for those without smartphone or Internet access (like landline phone and mail-in scheduling).Concentrating on vaccine passport apps as a silver bullet for getting back to normal is a mistake so long as an equitable vaccine rollout remains out of reach, and marginalized communities continue to be left behind.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

In an appearance on CNBC\'s Squawk Box on Monday, Gottlieb noted that vaccine production is ramping up — about 220 million doses will be put into the market by the end of March, and another 100 million will be made available in April. Those numbers will be higher if the FDA soon authorizes Johnson & Johnson\'s candidate for emergency use, as Gottlieb expects. By that point, he said, states will likely have to make the shots "generally available" because a shrinking, but still significant reluctance to get vaccinated among the American public means there won\'t be enough takers if only specific groups of people have access. "If we continue to ration it based on more and more narrow slices of the population, it\'s going to get harder to administer. So, I think we\'re just going to have to open this up to general availability, which is good news," he said, pinpointing the end of March and "certainly" April as target dates. Gottlieb cautioned that doesn\'t mean everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by April 1, but he does think most people will be able to schedule an appointment. "We\'re going to run out of demand sooner than we think. At some point in March and certainly by the end of March we\'re going to have to make this generally available ... everyone is going to be able to go online and get an appointment sooner than we think," says @ScottGottliebMD. pic.twitter.com/0mnWAUJN9J — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) February 8, 2021 More stories from theweek.com5 brutally funny cartoons about America\'s bungled vaccine rolloutWhat\'s the point of Trump\'s second impeachment trial?House Democrats will push to include $250-300 monthly child payments in stimulus bill', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Brazil&#39;s health authority said on Wednesday that although the volunteer had died, the trial would continue.

Nachman Ash said many Israelis had caught Covid in between their first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine, suggesting that the first jab is “less effective than we thought,” according to Army Radio. His remarks underline the importance of receiving a second vaccine dose, which according to recent studies is more than 90 per cent effective in protecting against coronavirus. Israel has already given the first of two jabs to nearly 30 per cent of the population and on Tuesday announced it would extend eligibility to those aged 40 and over. But Mr Ash is said to have warned at a cabinet meeting that a new strain of Covid originating in Britain was hampering efforts to tackle the pandemic, as it was responsible for nearly 40 per cent of new cases. It comes after two studies by Israeli healthcare providers found that the first dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by between 30 and 60 per cent. And according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, a survey by the health ministry found that around six per cent of 189,000 citizens who had received the first jab tested positive for Covid within two weeks. It also stated that 69 people from the sample had tested positive for coronavirus after receiving their second dose of the vaccine. Another study of a hundred people in Israel found that 98 per cent were protected from the disease once the second dose was administered. That research, carried out by the Sheba Medical Center, also said that a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine significantly refused the risk of spreading the virus to others. In Britain, there is a gap of up to 12 weeks between receiving the first and second dose, whereas the WHO recommends the second dose of Pfizer is administered within 21-28 days. Israeli health experts have stressed that it is too early to draw any concrete conclusions from the data.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': '1baa2c1142e86cd8022a980ecc9a07ab', 'title': 'Journalists’ Behavior over Luke Letlow’s Passing Is Abhorrent — and Telling', 'description': 'On Tuesday evening, Congressman-elect Luke Letlow’s (R., La.) family announced that he passed away at the age of 41 due to complications from COVID-19. He left behind a young family, including two small children, as well as a vast network of friends in Louisiana and Washington, D.C., all devastated by his passing.Some progressive Twitter activists and left-wing reporters couldn’t wait to begin their grave-dancing. Letlow deserved to die, they mused, because he didn’t take COVID seriously enough. They scoured his online presence to find any proof that he engaged in so-called “denialism.” Some, such as Vox’s Aaron Rupar, pointed to an October video where the then-candidate had the audacity to advocate for reopening the economy while maintaining state and federal precautions on coronavirus. Molly Jong-Fast of The Daily Beast also shared the video. Hundreds of their followers joined in, blaming Letlow for his own death and expressing that he was unworthy of pity because of his politics. For them, his death was further proof that those who dare propose policy prescriptions that differ from their own, no matter how rational or mainstream they may be, just have it coming to them.Setting aside the lack of evidence for their claim that Letlow denied the dangerous realities of coronavirus, the COVID ghouls and scolds clearly see themselves as worthy and qualified judges of their fellow man. It is they who decide whether or not people act appropriately enough to be spared death by coronavirus. As Michael Brendan Dougherty recently put it, they feel empowered to “turn every sick person into either a blameworthy fool or a blameless victim,” an extraordinarily arrogant and inhumane view of human suffering.In no other health circumstance would such brutality toward the afflicted be tolerated. We do not deem individuals who become sick by engaging in known “risky behaviors” -- unsafe sex, abuse of alcohol, drug use, poor diet, smoking, dangerous driving -- as deserving of pain and misery. So, mocking and haranguing those who become sick or die due to COVID-19, a novel virus from which we cannot possibly shield ourselves entirely, is unconscionable.But for these individuals, any expectations of their own behavior -- namely, to not be a terrible person in the face of others’ grief -- are secondary to soothing their own anxieties about the coronavirus. Blaming others may help them temporarily make sense of the sickness and death, but it can never provide them lasting relief from the unpleasant uncertainties this virus inflicts on us all.That doesn’t stop their callous campaigns from continuing. Look no further than the death of my former boss, Herman Cain, whose death from COVID-19 complications was touted as proof Republicans denied the risks of the coronavirus (never mind that Cain had a lengthy track record in both speech and practice of taking the virus seriously). These are the same individuals who were downright jubilant when President Trump and many on his team contracted the virus but are seemingly silent about COVID-19 diagnoses of other leaders who also benefited from ample safeguards, such as Letlow’s delegation colleague Congressman Cedric Richmond (D., La.) who contracted coronavirus while campaigning for Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia this month.Even among ordinary people, an individual’s desire to participate in day-to-day activities such as church services and dining out is enough cause to hector him for contracting the coronavirus. Prominent progressives, left-wing activists, and their media allies have routinely contended that if only Americans weren’t so stupid, selfish, and negligent -- and in particular, if red-staters could abandon their silly notions of constitutional rights and their incessant desire to keep local businesses open -- this pandemic would have been over a long time ago.But, for all the insistence that it is American obstinance that is perpetuating the pandemic, there’s not much evidence for such accusations. We are actually now masking at higher rates than ever before, which has been confirmed by observational studies showing broad compliance in retail establishments by customers and staff. Meanwhile, the TSA reports that since March 15, 2020, the rate of passengers passing through checkpoints is about 25 percent of 2019 totals. Americans have significantly curtailed socializing with others, despite scientists telling the New York Times that the data do not support claims that small gatherings catalyze coronavirus surges. And even as the very real pains of prolonged isolation and widespread depression caused by COVID-19 persist, the vast majority of American families have still greatly altered their holiday traditions by canceling plans, limiting gathering size, enforcing social distancing, and even requiring face coverings. The repeated insinuation that pigheaded Americans have refused to do what it takes to defeat the virus is tone-deaf, cruel, and simply untrue. In reality, we have sacrificed a lot more for a lot longer than anyone thought we could.And when the self-appointed COVID cops aren’t too busy condemning those who have gotten sick, they’re deciding who should be allowed to avoid illness via inoculation. With doses in the very early days of the vaccine rollout limited, they want to forbid Republican lawmakers from getting the inoculation because, as they again claim without evidence, they didn’t take the pandemic seriously. CNN contributor Ana Navarro-Cárdenas and liberal writer Kurt Eichenwald launched indignant tirades against Senator Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) for receiving his COVID-19 vaccine, casting blame on him for health systems not administering the vaccine quickly enough to frontline workers and even for how bad coronavirus has gotten in America.Of course, they found no room to criticize Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), 18 years Rubio’s junior, who received the vaccine at the same time he did. There was also noticeably no outcry about the highest-ranking Democrats, such as President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, receiving their vaccines after spending months portraying it as rushed and unsafe in hopes of scoring political points against President Donald Trump during the campaign. For progressives, COVID-19 denialism disqualifying someone from receiving a life-saving vaccine is exclusive to having different approaches to solving problems caused by the pandemic, but mysteriously doesn’t include fear-mongering the one surefire thing that will actually protect people.For the COVID nags, politics, not people, is everything. The pandemic has given them an opportunity to test out long-held policy preferences, including the government financially coercing people to adopt certain behaviors. To them, having a different approach is tantamount to wanting people to die. Wanting to spare your kids the developmental, educational, and social consequences of distance learning means wanting to kill their teachers. Missing the financial stability and personal fulfillment of having your business open? You want to stay in business, and thus, you’re okay with getting people sick. Feeling distressed because you can’t bury your loved one but watch large-scale political demonstrations take place without officials intervening? Stop being selfish.Perhaps most disturbing is the utter lack of qualifications these individuals have to make such judgments. They don’t have the humility to concede lawmakers across the political spectrum are forced to weigh ever-changing public-health guidance with other policy factors when governing. Meanwhile, no serious epidemiologist would ever expect policymaking to be dictated exclusively by health directives, but talking heads are convinced enough of their own expertise to demand they must be. They also seem unwilling to accept that with so many aspects of the virus unknown throughout the pandemic and the efficacy of many of our mitigation efforts still unclear, most lawmakers and the public are doing all they can to prevent any sickness and loss of life. Still, it’s easier to blame someone, and even easier if that someone doesn’t share your political philosophy.They do so at our country’s peril. While one may glean fleeting satisfaction by blaming others for the pain and uncertainty we’re all experiencing, the scars from the scolds will persist long after the pandemic is blessedly behind us. People understand they’re being closely watched and judged, and they’re acutely aware that those who disagree with them will find no room for mercy or compromise -- or worse, think them deserving of death because they disagree with their worldview.Instead, we should all try to be kinder and more gracious toward each other. Most people are doing the absolute best they can, often making incredibly tough decisions amid extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Nearly everyone knows the coronavirus is a threat they must take seriously. No one wants people to get sick and die, and it’s time to stop acting as if they do.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The emerging $900 million legislation, based on a proposal from a bipartisan group of Senate moderate, is believed to contain $600 direct stimulus payments for many Americans, but "senators are walking around clueless, with no idea what to expect or when to expect it."Meanwhile, President Trump, who hasn\'t been directly involved in the negotiations, was ready to step in Thursday with a demand for "substantially larger stimulus payments," The Washington Post reports, and he "was in the middle of formally drafting his demand for the larger payments when White House officials told him that doing so could imperil delicate negotiations over the economic relief package." Trump reportedly told allies Thursday afternoon he wants stimulus checks of "at least" $1,200 per person, but preferably as big as $2,000."The aides were really frantic, saying, \'We can\'t do this. It will blow up negotiations,\'" one person who heard the exchange told the Post. Trump has previously publicly supported larger stimulus checks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump\'s main negotiator on COVID-19 legislation, included Trump\'s name on an earlier round of $1,200 checks.The $600 checks are in the legislation largely due to an intervention by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-V.t) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not include any such payments in his sparser proposals, and many Senate Republicans are insisting the legislation come in at under $1 trillion; stimulus checks larger than $600 would push the price tag above that mark.

Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty ImagesWith the U.S. facing vaccination delays because of worker shortages and distribution problems, federal health officials now say it’s OK to push back the second dose of the two-part vaccine by as much as six weeks. As an infectious disease doctor, I’ve been fielding a lot of questions from my patients as well as my friends and family about whether the COVID-19 vaccine will still work if people are late receiving their second dose. Why you need two doses 3-4 weeks apart Two doses, separated by three to four weeks, is the tried-and-true approach to generate an effective immune response through vaccination, not just for COVID but for hepatitis A and B and other diseases as well. The first dose primes the immune system and introduces the body to the germ of interest. This allows the immune system to prepare its defense. The second dose, or booster, provides the opportunity for the immune system to ramp up the quality and quantity of the antibodies used to fight the virus. In the case of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, the second dose increases the protection afforded by the vaccine from 60% to approximately 95%. Why the CDC decided receiving the second dose within 42 days is OK In the clinical trial, the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine was administered as early as day 19 and as late as day 42 to 93% of the subjects. Since protection was approximately 95% for everyone who was vaccinated within this time “window,” there is little reason not to allow some flexibility in the timing of the second dose 2. As more vaccine becomes available, the timing of the second dose should be close to four weeks for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. But the good news is that even while supplies remain limited, the science suggests that there’s nothing bad about getting a second dose as late as 42 days after the first. What the immune system does between the first and second dose The biology through which the mRNA vaccines induce their protection from COVID-19 is fundamentally different from that with other vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein. Upon injection of the vaccine, the mRNA enters into immune cells called dendritic cells. The dendritic cells use the instructions written in the mRNA to synthesize the hallmark spike glycoprotein, which characterizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. These immune cells then show the spike glycoprotein to B-cells, which then make anti-spike antibodies. Dendritic cells recognize viruses and present information about the spike protein to T-cells. T-cells provide information about the viral spike protein to B-cells, which are transformed to memory B-cells that store information about the virus. When this memory B-cell is activated with an infection or the second dose of the vaccine, this causes some of the B-cells to change into plasma B-cells that secrete protective antibodies that fight the virus. Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images The mRNA vaccines are uniquely capable of inducing a special kind of immune cell – called a T-follicular helper cell – to help B-cells produce antibodies. The T-cells do this through direct contact with the B-cells and by sending chemical signals that tell the B-cells to produce antibodies. It is this help in antibody production that makes these vaccines so effective. But not all B-cells are the same. There are two kinds that make anti-spike antibodies: long-lived plasma cells and memory B-cells. The long-lived plasma cells, as their name implies, live in the bone marrow for years after vaccination, continuously churning out antibody – in this case anti-spike antibody. These long-lived B-cells do not need to be boosted. The memory B-cells, on the other hand, live in a state akin to hibernation. They do not produce antibodies until stimulated by a booster of the vaccine, or are exposed to infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That is the reason we need that second dose. Together these two types of B-cells provide a constant level of protection. What happens if you don’t get the Pfizer or Moderna second dose on time? With current vaccine shortages, and problems with setting up the infrastructure to vaccinate millions of people, many physicians are concerned that the second dose of vaccine won’t be delivered in the prescribed three-to-four-week window.

He hands over the Oval Office at a grim juncture. Deaths from the coronavirus, which Trump referred to in his final address as “the China virus,” surpassed 400,000 on Tuesday, and the American economy has not recovered from the shock of the pandemic. He lauded his administration’s response to COVID-19, particularly the development of multiple vaccines against the virus.Trump faces an unprecedented second impeachment trial, and more than 20,000 members of the National Guard are stationed in Washington, D.C., in anticipation of violence during President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.Trump tweeted the 20-minute video via the official White House Twitter account, as his personal handle, @RealDonaldTrump, was banned in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. After he leaves office, he will still face an impeachment trial in the Senate on charges of inciting an insurrection for his role in encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol building.“All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated,” he said in the address.Trump plans to fly to Florida Wednesday before Biden is inaugurated, the first time an outgoing president has declined to attend his successor’s induction ceremony in more than a century. Vice President Mike Pence tweeted his goodbye: “Thank you for the privilege of serving as your Vice President these past four years, it has been the greatest honor of my life.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'a8c6e00b7e1ab204088ef6a0ce3eb0b6', 'title': '5 Key Takeaways From Biden’s First Presidential Press Conference', 'description': "President Joe Biden’s first news conference in office covered a range of topics, including the migrant surge at the southern U.S. border, GOP efforts to restrict voting rights, foreign relations with China and North Korea and the timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. But Biden also made clear that his next priority is the massive, two-part jobs and infrastructure bill that he said he will announce in more detail on Friday, and he made news on other fronts as well. Here are five key takeaways from Thursday’s turn in front of the news media: A new goal for vaccinations: Biden opened his remarks by announcing a new target for Covid-19 vaccinations of 200 million shots administered in his first 100 days in office. The administration reached its previous goal of 100 million shots last week, and Biden said the new benchmark was “ambitious,” but given that the news conference came on Biden’s 65th day as president and that the country is now averaging about 2.5 million doses a day, the target should be reachable. In what could be seen as a sign of how much progress has been made in the fight against Covid, Biden didn’t get asked one question about his pandemic response during the hour-long press conference. That could also be a sign of the news media’s Covid fatigue and limited attention span, given that new cases are still averaging nearly 60,000 a day and deaths are still averaging more than 1,000 a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warned this week that case rates are increasing slightly. A focus on the infrastructure package: Biden said his “next major initiative” will be “to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure in this country so we can compete and create significant numbers of really good paying jobs.” He said he will announce more details Friday at an event in Pittsburgh. That proposal reportedly will be broken into two parts, one centered on infrastructure and clean energy and the other focused on domestic priorities including education, paid leave and child care. The plan is expected to call for some $3 trillion in spending, paid for in part by tax increases on corporations and the wealthy. “I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth,” Biden said Thursday. Biden’s plan is sure to face sharp pushback from Republicans, who have already dismissed the idea of raising taxes. Bracing for budget battles: Biden on Thursday derided the GOP’s fiscal approach. “When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea,” he said, contrasting that to what he called GOP support for “feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans.” In answering a question on relations with Beijing, Biden also reiterated his call for government investment in science and research as a way to compete with China. “Back in the ‘60s we used to invest a little over 2% of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it’s 0.7%. I’m going to change that.” Biden said the country must pursue investments in medical research on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes in addition to research on artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. Support for filibuster reform: Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, said the filibuster is “being abused in a gigantic way” and that he “strongly supports” a return to a talking filibuster, which would require senators to stay on the floor to block legislation instead of just raising more painless procedural objections. He also indicated that he might support going further. “We’re going to get a lot done, and if we have to, if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about,” he said. Biden also said he agreed that the filibuster is a “relic of the Jim Crow era,” but he didn’t specify what other changes he might support. The future of the filibuster could be key to Biden’s hopes to advancing major elements of his agenda, and Biden likely doesn’t have the Democratic votes he would need to eliminate the filibuster completely, leaving him trying to pressure Republicans into backing an agenda that he emphasizes has wide public backing. “Here’s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, to continue the politics of division,” he said. Biden expects to run for a second term: Biden is 78, the oldest president to take office, and there had been talk during the campaign that he might step aside after one term. He told reporters Thursday that he expects to run again in 2024, and that he expects Vice President Kamala Harris to again be on the ticket. Asked who he thinks he’ll be running against, Biden said he doesn’t think about it and has no idea: “I have no idea whether there will be a Republican Party. Do you?” Like what you're reading?

Biden does not intend to delay the second shot for those patients, and is instead counting on an increased production to keep pace. But, Wen says, not only is there no guarantee of a smooth manufacturing process, much of the slowdown has occurred between distribution and injection, so until that stage improves the risk of delay remains.> First, the bottleneck now is not supply, but the "last mile" between getting the vaccine to distribution sites & injecting it into people\'s arms.

First approved by Britain on Wednesday, the AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper and easier to use than some rival shots. But it has been plagued by uncertainty about its most effective dosage. It is being made locally by the Serum Institute of India.  The other vaccine is known as COVAXIN. It was developed locally by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Little is known about the results of its clinical trials.  India’s Information and Broadcasting Minister, Prakash Javadekar, said two other vaccines are waiting approval, one from India, the other from Russia.   “India is perhaps the only country where four vaccines are getting ready at one time.

{'_id': '78ac56d40a199f389e87c9e8ea36fdb2', 'title': 'Pfizer and Moderna vaccines prove 92 percent effective with just 1st dose', 'description': 'Just one dose of the Moderna and Pfizer two-shot coronavirus vaccines is seemingly nearly as good two. In a study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, a pair of Canadian-based researchers suggested an amendment to the determined efficacy of the Pfizer vaccines after just one shot. While Pfizer and BioNTech reported their vaccine was just 52.4 percent effective at preventing infection after the first dose, the researchers noted that this data includes results from within the first two weeks after inoculation, "when immunity would have still been mounting." After two weeks, that efficacy mounted to 92.6 percent, matching the first-dose efficacy of 92.1 percent reported from the Moderna vaccine as well. After two doses, the Pfizer vaccine is 95 percent effective, and Moderna\'s is 94 percent. The Canadian-based researchers\' interpretations of the Pfizer results led them to suggest in the letter that vaccine distributors delay giving people the second dose. This would let distributors get first doses to more at-risk people instead of leaving them "completely unprotected" — something the researchers called "a matter of national security that, if ignored, will certainly result in thousands of COVID-19–related hospitalizations and deaths this winter in the United States." Another study from January led Pfizer and BioNTech to say Wednesday that they are unsure if the vaccine will be effective at protecting against the B.1.351 variant first found in South Africa. The study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found the vaccine was still capable of neutralizing the virus within the B.1.351 strain, and that trials haven\'t shown the variant reduces the vaccine\'s protection in people. Still, the companies may end up creating a booster shot to ensure the vaccine remains effective against the highly transmissible strain.

However, while the FDA confirmed on Tuesday that the Pfizer vaccine appears to meet the standard for emergency use authorization, confirming both its safety and efficacy, there are still a lot of people who are concerned about its potential side effects. One nurse researcher, Kristen Choi, Ph.D., RN, wants to raise awareness about the "worst-case scenario" side effects of the two-part vaccine that could potentially save thousands upon thousands of lives if enough of the population rolls up their sleeves and receives it. SPOILER ALERT: She says take the vaccine anyway! It\'s essential to do so, to stop this pandemic! Read on,. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.The Worst Symptom Will Likely Be a FeverIn a perspective piece published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, Choi details her experience receiving the experimental COVID-19 vaccine in a phase 3 trial. She reveals that her worst symptom was a fleeting but extremely high fever — which happens to be one of the main initial symptoms of the virus itself — and that it appeared after she received the booster a month after her initial injection.She explains that after the second dose, she immediately started experiencing symptoms. "My arm quickly became painful at the injection site, much more than the first time. By the end of the day, I felt light-headed, chilled, nauseous, and had a splitting headache. I went to bed early and fell asleep immediately. Around midnight, I woke up feeling worse—feverish and chilled, nauseated, dizzy, and hardly able to lift my arm from muscle pain at the injection site. My temperature was 99.4 °F (37.4 °C). I tossed and turned, sleeping little during the rest of the night," she wrote.\xa0"When I woke up again at 5:30 am, I felt hot. Burning. I took my temperature and looked at the reading: 104.9 °F (40.5 °C). This was the highest fever I can ever remember having, and it scared me. I took acetaminophen and drank a glass of water. When the research office opened at 9 am, I called to report my reaction to the injection. Thankfully, my fever had come down to 102.0 °F (38.9 °C) by then."She continued to explain that the research nurse confirmed that "A lot of people have reactions after the second injection." She continued monitoring her symptoms, with her fever hovering around 99.5 °F (37.5 °C) for the rest of the day. "By the next morning, all my symptoms were gone except a sore, swollen bump at the injection site," she added.\xa0These Symptoms Are Worst Case ScenarioIt is important to note that Choi\'s symptoms are not a common side effect of the vaccine. Two vaccine experts, William J. Moss, MD, MPH, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins\' Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland and Albert Rizzo, MD, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, confirmed to\xa0Medscape Medical News that they are the worst case scenario.\xa0"The type of side effects we\'re seeing with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are typical of any vaccine, though there is a spectrum," Moss explained. "The numbers I\'ve seen range from maybe 2% to 10% \xad\xad— maybe up to 15% — of people having these kinds of really noticeable side effects. Again all transient. But some people have more severe [reactions] than others."\xa0Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said "prolonged side effects" from vaccines like this are "very rare," mentioning "side effects that occur" can include "immediate pain in the arm and the fever."Keep in mind that COVID-19 is responsible for the deaths of 1.54 million people globally. Of the survivors hundreds of thousands haven\'t fully recovered, with many suffering from prolonged symptoms for months on end. However, vaccine symptoms — even the most extreme — "are always transient, lasting 12-36 hours, maybe 48 hours," Moss reiterates.\xa0RELATED: COVID Symptoms Usually Appear in This Order, Study Finds"I Would Do it Again in a Heartbeat"Choi also clarified that it hasn\'t been confirmed whether she actually received the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was the placebo, but due to her symptoms she is confident it was the former.\xa0Choi wants to make it clear that she is all for the vaccine. "I would do it again in a heartbeat even if I knew I was going to have the same reaction," she said.As for yourself, follow Dr. Anthony Fauci\'s fundamentals and help end this surge, until he says not to, vaccine or no vaccine—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don\'t go indoors with people you\'re not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene and to protect your life and the lives of others, and don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

What could go wrong? Well, a lot. The country has never attempted a mass vaccination of this scale, or on this timeline, ever before. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading infectious disease expert, sounds confident about the distribution—"We have a long, long history of the distribution of vaccines," he has said—but he did this weekend reveal one fear—in fact, his "biggest fear," about the vaccine. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.\xa0Dr. Fauci Fears Not Enough People Will Get Vaccinated in Order for It to Be Effective"My primary biggest fear is that a substantial proportion of the people will be hesitant to get vaccinated," Fauci told the Daily Beast. "I think there are going to be many people who don\'t want to get vaccinated right away. But once you get, you know, tens of millions of people vaccinated, it looks like it\'s working and it\'s safe, then I think we\'ll win over a large proportion of the rest of the population, who might have some hesitancy about getting vaccinated."Fauci has previously said returning to normality depends on these folks overcoming that hesitancy. "Let\'s say we get 75 percent, 80 percent of the population vaccinated," Fauci said at an online "When Public Health Means Business" event sponsored by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "If we do that, if we do it efficiently enough over the second quarter of 2021, by the time we get to the end of the summer, i.e., the third quarter, we may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society that as we get to the end of 2021, we can approach very much some degree of normality that is close to where we were before.""It\'s not going to be like turning a light switch on and off at all," he has said about getting back to normal. "99% of the people are not going to be vaccinated, they\'re not going to want to be vaccinated. So let\'s say you have…65 to 80% of the people want to get vaccinated. You still have a lot of people in society. And let\'s take this country as a societal unit that are vulnerable to being infected.""So," he continued, "we\'re going to softly go to a graded degree of normality."RELATED: If You Feel This, You May Have Already Had COVID, Says Dr. FauciDr. Fauci\'s "Worst Nightmare" Has Come True BeforeFauci has previously said: "People have asked me throughout the years what my worst nightmare was, and I always, always say, \'Well, it\'s a brand new infection that jumped species, that\'s a respiratory-borne, and that has a spectacular capability of going from person-to-person and has a high degree of morbidity and mortality, either in the general population or amongst selected groups," he revealed.Sound familiar? His worst nightmare is basically COVID-19. "Well, here we are. You know, I\'m living that thing that I feared the most," he confessed.Fauci pointed out that "this is the worst outbreak that we\'ve had of a respiratory borne illness in 102 years."Until enough of us have taken the vaccine for it to be effective, do what you can to stop it from spreading—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don\'t go indoors with people you\'re not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene and to protect your life and the lives of others, and don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Additionally, Pew notes that "much of the decline has come among Republicans and GOP leaners," 60 percent of whom approve of Trump\'s job performance compared to 77 percent in August.Additionally, Pew found that Trump voters "have grown more critical of their candidate\'s post-election conduct," as the "share of his supporters who describe his conduct as poor has doubled over the past two months, from 10 percent to 20 percent." The poll also found that only 29 percent of respondents said Trump should remain a major figure in U.S. politics in the years to come, while 68 percent said he shouldn\'t be.The poll was conducted in the wake of last week\'s deadly attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, which led to Trump becoming the first president in American history to be impeached twice. In the poll, three-quarters of respondents said Trump bears either a lot or some responsibility for the riot, while only 24 percent said he isn\'t responsible at all. Ahead of his upcoming Senate impeachment trial, 54 percent of respondents also said it would be better for Trump to be removed from office than finish his term, a possibility that has been ruled out due to the trial not being expected to begin until President-elect Joe Biden is in office.Pew Research Center conducted its poll by surveying 5,360 U.S. adults from Jan. 8-12.

Joyce Beatty\'s (D-Ohio) phone lit up with calls from constituents who were "newly curious" about getting vaccinated themselves, she told The New York Times. As Beatty explained, watching a Black woman receive the vaccine "gave people hope and gave people education." Black Americans are nearly three times more likely to die from the coronavirus, the Times notes, but they are far less likely to be inoculated, in large part because of a lack of access, but also, some experts have pointed out, because of longstanding weariness about government-driven health programs. Harris, it seems, was able to ease some of those concerns with her public vaccination, and she also has reportedly pressed President Biden and his advisers to focus on how their policies will ensure less advantage people in both urban and rural settings are protected against the virus. "The vice president pushed us hard, in a very good way," Jeffrey Zients, Biden\'s coronavirus response coordinator told the Times. "She pushed me on, \'Where we are on mobile vaccination units?

The EXO-CD24 substance was developed at the Ichilov Medical Centre in Tel Aviv and successfully completed its first phase of clinical trials on Friday. The treatment was given to 30 patients with coronavirus, whose conditions ranged from moderate to severe. Twenty-nine of the patients were then discharged from the hospital in the following three to five days, while one patient took slightly longer to recover. A protein known as CD24 is delivered to the lungs by exosomes in the drug, which helps to rebalance the immune system and prevent it from overreacting to the virus. Professor Nadir Arber originally designed EXO-CD24, which is breathed in as a gas and taken once every five days, in order to treat patients who had ovarian cancer. “Even if the vaccines do their job, and even if there aren't any new mutations, one way or another, the coronavirus will be staying with us,” Prof Arber told the news site Arutz Sheva. “That’s why we developed this special medication. It’s been about half a year from the time the idea was hatched to the first human trials [being] conducted.” Roni Gamzu, the director of the Ichilov Medical Centre, said that the research during phase one of the trial was “advanced and sophisticated and may save coronavirus patients”. Speaking to the Times of Israel, he said: “The results of the phase one trials are excellent, and all give us confidence in the method Arber has been researching in his lab for many years.” No placebo was used in the first stage of the trial, and the next phase of the clinical trials will continue to examine the effects and efficacy of the treatment. The drug Allocetra, which has been developed at the Hadassah Medical Centre, has also reported promising results in the second stage of its clinical trial. Israel announced yesterday that it will ease lockdown restrictions but keep its borders closed after a drop in its number of coronavirus cases.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '15e51afdb3bae0b9c98c1ed51559e42f', 'title': "A President Who Can't Put Aside Grudges, Even for Good News", 'description': 'It was among the most consequential weeks of President Donald Trump\'s tenure: Across the country, health care workers began receiving a lifesaving coronavirus vaccine. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers neared a deal on economic relief aimed at averting a deeper recession. And Friday, federal regulators authorized a second vaccine.Yet Trump was largely absent from those events. It was Vice President Mike Pence who held a call with governors Dec. 14 to hail a "medical miracle" and who received the Pfizer vaccine at week\'s end on live television. Legislative leaders were the ones working late into the nights on a stimulus deal.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAll the while, Trump was conducting a Twitter-borne assault on Republicans for not helping him overturn the election results, even warning Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to "get tougher, or you won\'t have a Republican Party anymore." By the weekend, the president was considering naming a conspiracy theorist as special counsel to investigate voting fraud, for which there is no evidence, asking his advisers about instituting martial law and downplaying a massive hack his own secretary of state attributed to Russia.Seldom has the leader of an American political party done so much to strike fear into the hearts of his allies but done so little to tackle challenges facing the country during his final days in office. Far from presenting the vaccine breakthroughs from Pfizer and Moderna as testaments to private-sector ingenuity and innovation -- once a conservative creed -- he was fixated on menacing Republicans who might dare to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect.That duality in Trump\'s behavior -- acting as a bystander while other leaders answered a crisis and simultaneously raging at Republicans who have inched away from him -- also amounts to a preview of Trump\'s post-presidency.He has shown no interest in shaping the debates that lay ahead for Republicans, in tending to the party\'s electoral health or in becoming a champion of America\'s recovery. Rather, he seems intent on using his political platform to wage personal vendettas and stoke a shared sense of grievance with the voters he has long cultivated as a fan base.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said the president\'s fury blinded him to his last best chance to buff his legacy: visiting vaccine distribution sites and clinics to highlight the possibility of hope after nine months of national misery."The president could have made that the hallmark of his last days in office," Romney said. "Instead, he\'s seen as promoting conspiracy theories and evidence-free accusations of fraud, which lead to a color of a sore loser."Some Republicans see an upside ahead -- especially those who have largely avoided Trump\'s fury.They believe the president\'s departure might allow Republicans to return to some of the themes that proved effective in down-ballot races last month, while also depriving Democrats of their most dependable boogeyman. In that rosy vision, lawmakers might step gingerly in public to avoid Trump\'s wrath but otherwise go about their business, assuming Trump\'s focus will never linger on one matter for long, while they elevate the perceived excesses of the left."When Trump is no longer in office, there\'s going to be less focus on personality and \'What did he tweet today? What did he say today?\'" predicted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, adding, hopefully, that Democrats would soon struggle with internal divisions in a "Tea Party moment" akin to what Republicans faced a decade ago.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was even more succinct, arguing that the Democrats\' left wing would alienate moderate voters."Our problem is tone; their problem is policy," Graham said of the two parties. "We\'ve both got to overcome problems, but I like our chances better because we can act better, and it\'s harder for them to legislate differently."Yet if that is the view from the lofty perch of the Senate, there is little evidence at the ground level of Republican politics that Trump and his divisive persona are receding as forces in the party. Indeed, Republicans have recently struggled to articulate what their party stands for other than fealty to Trump.Trump never espoused a set of plans for his second term, and for the last four years no one else has achieved the stature to detail an affirmative vision for the party. The coronavirus relief negotiations have also exposed serious ideological rifts among Republicans about the role of government in aiding suffering Americans.Many of Trump\'s signature governing achievements -- cutting taxes for businesses and the wealthy, weakening the Affordable Care Act and rolling back environmental regulation -- have been unpopular with many moderate voters.As apathetic as Trump can be about many parts of his job, some Republicans say they do not expect his grip to weaken on party affairs. Even if he is reduced somewhat in stature, they say, he is likely to remain the formidable figurehead of a personality cult.Former Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who lost a Republican primary in 2018 after crossing Trump, said he saw little evidence that his party was looking to Trump and the White House for a governing vision. But, he said, the "fear factor" remained strong."The default on the Republican side still is the status quo, which is: People have learned to be very deferential to the president based on self-preservation," Sanford said.It is fitting that the split outlook on the party\'s post-Trump future broadly falls along House and Senate lines.In the same week that McConnell publicly acknowledged Biden had won and privately instructed his caucus to refrain from challenging the results on the Senate floor next month, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, declined to acknowledge the president\'s defeat and did nothing to discourage a group of far-right lawmakers plotting a protest of Biden\'s election in the House.The House has long been more ideological than the Senate, in both parties. Every member of the Senate Republican leadership used their weekly news conference last week to welcome the arrival of the vaccine -- and not one of them approached saying the word Trump.House Republicans worry more than their Senate peers about Trump\'s supporters and the threat they could pose in future primaries, especially if whipped up by Trump.The two top House Republicans, McCarthy and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, both signed onto the recent, failed lawsuit from Texas seeking to overturn the results of the election. They were joined by a majority of House Republicans but not one senator.Trump\'s commanding influence over many in the party has driven a number of House Republicans to retire in the last two election cycles. One of them, Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan, quit the party last week out of dismay about Republicans\' attacks on the election. Mitchell is the second lawmaker to leave the party during this session of Congress, after his fellow Michigander, Rep. Justin Amash.Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va., who lost a primary this year and is also contemplating leaving the party, said he believed much of the Republican caucus was cowed by Trump and would most likely remain that way. He estimated that about 60% of the lawmakers questioning the results of the election knew that their claims were nonsense."It seems like the constant fight in the Republican Party," Riggleman said, "is trying to stop the lunatics from taking over the asylum."The strength of Trump\'s hold on the party will be tested in the coming months in Virginia, where two of the party\'s leading contenders for governor next year responded very differently to the Electoral College results. Kirk Cox, the former state House speaker, acknowledged Biden\'s victory, while state Sen. Amanda Chase called for martial law.Whether Trump intervenes in the Virginia race, how the Republican candidates approach him and what kind of response voters have to the soon-to-be former president may set the stage for the 2022 midterm elections, in which both parties\' fortunes may turn on the strength of the country\'s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.For now, many ambitious Republicans are glad to embrace the element of Trumpism that is most animating to the right: seizing on the most extreme ideas of the left. Such oppositional politics allows party leaders to draw attention away from Trump, reminds voters of what gives them pause about Democrats and has effectively become the adhesive binding Republicans together.The GOP\'s de facto platform -- that the left has gone around the bend -- was on display last week when a range of figures on the right, including two potential presidential candidates in 2024, Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas, highlighted a report that San Francisco was considering stripping Abraham Lincoln\'s name from one of its schools.With millions of Americans at risk of losing unemployment benefits, though, most of the party\'s congressional wing was focused last week on pandemic relief.The final major legislative acts of Trump\'s presidency may well arise not from the White House but from bipartisan coalitions on Capitol Hill that have filled a leadership vacuum in Washington. One such coalition, a loose group of centrists in the House and Senate, forged a framework for striking a deal on a winter relief package for individuals and businesses.While Trump\'s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has participated intermittently in the talks, the final agreement is expected to be settled by congressional leadership. On another matter, lawmakers in both parties have spurned Trump\'s demands to use an annual military policy bill to strip technology companies from certain legal protections, raising the prospect that Trump\'s final legislative fight could end in his first overridden veto.Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist close to McConnell, said Trump was squandering a chance to define the end of his presidency."Whether he likes it or not, a bunch of positive stuff could happen as he leaves office," Jennings said. "I would want maximum credit. He could sign all these things into law and be part of the process."Jennings said Trump\'s invisibility during the vaccine rollout was especially baffling. "If it had been me, I would have had Air Force One sitting on the tarmac in Louisville waiting for that plane," Jennings said, referring to the arrival of the Pfizer medication.But Trump has always been most formidable when on the attack, against Republicans and Democrats alike. As one of his most prominent critics noted, if the president continues to play the role of troller-in-chief, he will cast a long shadow over the Republican Party."If he wants to have a very active role and be on TV every day and be the voice attacking the Biden administration, why, he\'s going to set the vision of the Republican Party for the next four years and maybe beyond," Romney said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Gina Bisignano, the 52-year-old owner of Gina’s Eyelashes and Skincare, and 37-year-old John Strand are also facing charges.Gold garnered national attention in July when she organized a press conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to condemn pandemic lockdowns and rave about how “hydroxychloroquine works” as a treatment for COVID-19. The doctor made a similar speech during the Jan. 6 insurrection, confirming to The Washington Post she was photographed holding a megaphone on the Rotunda floor. (In June, the FDA revoked its emergency authorization of hydroxychloroquine, stating the drug could actually do more harm than good because of its “ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potentially serious side effects.”)According to a criminal complaint filed against Gold and Strand, federal authorities were tipped off to the pair\'s attendance by The Washington Post article. In a 30-second video, Gold can be seen speaking in the Rotunda while two police officers stand behind her, gesturing at her and others to leave.

Five people died and dozens were injured during the riots, as thousands of MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol and forced elected leaders to go into hiding for hours.Gold also admitted she went to Jan. 6 event with Strand, the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand and Gold were pictured in a photo circulated by the FBI. The doctor told the Post she was fired from her job as an emergency room physician for two hospitals in July after her speech—and has not worked as a medical professional since.The complaint states federal authorities received many tips that the pair participated in the riots, including several photos of them inside the Capitol building. One witness told authorities, “an old acquaintance was posting pictures of himself taking over the capitol yesterday. He was calling for a revolution on his social media accounts…[i]ndividual broke into the capital building and is paid to promote propaganda on his website.”In a photo posted to a Twitter account associated with Strand, he’s pictured in front of the Capitol steps during the riot. “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION,” a caption reads, according to the criminal complaint. Gold and Strand are also in a Getty video with a large crowd “attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time,” the complaint says, adding, “One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near” the pair.In an interview with the Beverly Hills Courier, Bisignano confirmed her involvement in the storming of the Capitol. Claiming she was just “caught up” in the moment, Bisignano told the outlet that she witnessed fighting during the siege—but insisted, without offering a shred of evidence, that the violence was “antifa and BLM.”ARRESTED: Gina Bisignano, 52, owns Gina’s Eyelashes And Skincare in Beverly Hills, California.

(Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) In his seventh week in office, President Joe Biden is expected to sign the American Rescue Plan Act into effect on Wednesday. The massive piece of legislation will provide direct payments to Americans, extend jobless benefits, and offer financial relief to state and local governments, among a number of other initiatives aimed at boosting the economy and inspiring hope as the U.S. stays on course to move past the coronavirus pandemic. While many headlines focus on the question at the forefront of everyone’s minds — when stimulus checks will arrive — there are many other important developments in this $1.9 trillion plan that are worth highlighting. Namely, this relief package dedicates considerable funding for an ambitious anti-poverty program and significant benefits for low-income people. “It’s a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday. Many Republican politicians have attacked the measure as wasteful and excessive; however, most people in the U.S. don’t seem to share their sentiments. A Pew Research Center poll released Tuesday found that 70% of Americans support the relief package. On Thursday, Biden is scheduled to showcase the bill during a primetime TV address that will also mark one year since the coronavirus prompted nationwide shutdowns. As stimulus checks arrive in the mail, we outlined just a few of the other elements of the COVID relief package. Funding to help schools reopen Focusing efforts on getting schools to reopen — including implementing models of social distancing measures, hybrid programs, and prioritizing vaccines for educators — has been near the top of the list of talking points for politicians during the pandemic. Getting students back to in-person classes has been a primary concern for both political parties. Within the American Rescue Plan, there is $128 billion allotted in grants to state educational agencies, reports NPR, with 90% of it allocated to local education agencies. Another $39 billion in grants has been earmarked for higher education institutions. Nearly $15 billion of the relief funds will be given to the Child Care & Development Block Grant program with the aim of supporting childcare facilities, and a special focus on high-need areas. A more generous child tax-relief credit For 2021, the relief bill will temporarily expand the child tax credit. Currently, it is worth up to $2,000 per child under the age of 17. But under this new legislation, the tax credit will be as much as $3,600 for children up to five and $3,000 for children aged six to 17. The bill would also make the full value of the credit available to low-income people who, currently, are ineligible or receive only a portion of the tax credit. In the second half of this year, this measure will require the federal government to send the credit in the form of an advance payment in periodic installments. It is essentially a guaranteed supplemental income for families with children. A financial boost for the Affordable Care Act For those purchasing health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace, the bill will temporarily increase subsidies, which means lower monthly premiums and possibly lower copays. This will also help people who have lost jobs keep the health insurance they had through their previous employer by covering the full cost of premiums through a federal program called COBRA. Currently, this program is set to go through in September. Funding for back rent and rent assistance Approximately $20 billion will go to state and local governments to help low-income households cover the cost of housing, including back rent, rent assistance, and utility bills. According to CNN, $10 billion would be allotted to help struggling homeowners pay their mortgages, utilities, and property taxes. $5 billion is for assisting those at risk of homelessness. The remaining $5 billion is set aside for emergency housing vouchers for those who are already homeless. A step toward student loan forgiveness The idea of forgiving individual student loan debt anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 has progressively become a more mainstream concept. While it was not included in this bill, there is a very important provision tucked away in the lengthy stimulus package that increases the pressure on Biden to address the student debt crisis by removing one of its most discussed hurdles. The provision states that anyone whose student loans are discharged through 2025 will not face tax consequences, reports Vox. Typically, debt cancellation is considered taxable income meaning that if all of a sudden, $50,000 of an individual’s student loans were forgiven, it would come up on their taxes as if they earned an additional $50,000 that year. With this commonly argued point out of the way, it appears as though the path is being paved for more progress on student loan forgiveness. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?Republicans Criticize Biden For Saying "Nance"Is Joe Biden Doing Enough?Did Biden Shoot Down Student Debt Forgiveness?', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '7d58c31ab6abc313de2ab99050e8c7c0', 'title': "Hospital Workers Start to 'Turn Against Each Other' to Get Vaccine", 'description': 'NEW YORK -- At NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, one of the most highly regarded hospitals in New York City, a rumor spread last week that the line for the coronavirus vaccine on the ninth floor was unguarded and anyone could stealthily join and receive the shot.Under the rules, the most exposed health care employees were supposed to go first, but soon those from lower-risk departments, including a few who spent much of the pandemic working from home, were getting vaccinated.The lapse, which occurred within 48 hours of the first doses arriving in the city, incited anger among staff members -- and an apology from the hospital.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"I am so disappointed and saddened that this happened," a top executive at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, Dr. Craig Albanese, wrote in an email to staff, which was obtained by The New York Times.The arrival of thousands of vaccine doses in New York City hospitals last week was greeted with an outpouring of hope from doctors and nurses who had worked through the devastating first wave in March and April. But for now, the vaccine is in very short supply, and some hospitals seem to have stumbled through the rollout.Most of the vaccinations in the New York region to date have involved hospitals giving shots to their own employees, a relatively easy process compared with what is to come as part of the largest vaccination initiative in the nation since the 1940s.The dynamics playing out at hospitals in New York City may be emblematic of what may happen across the country in the near future, when all adults will be given a place in the vaccination line by either the government or their employers.In interviews for this article, more than half a dozen doctors and nurses at New York area hospitals said they were upset at how the vaccine was being distributed at their institutions. They described what had happened to The New York Times but asked that their names not be used because hospitals have shown a willingness to fire or punish employees for speaking to the news media during the pandemic.At some major hospitals in Manhattan, doctors and nurses have recalled scrolling through social media and pausing to make a snap judgment each time they saw a selfie one of their colleagues had posted of getting vaccinated: Did that person deserve to be vaccinated before they were?"We feel disrespected and underappreciated due to our second-tier priority for vaccination," a group of anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai Hospital wrote to administrators over the weekend.Health care workers said rumors were proliferating in WhatsApp groups and amid the banter of the operating room. Stories have begun to circulate of a plastic surgeon who managed to get vaccinated early, of doses being thrown out at one Manhattan hospital because of poor planning. On group chats, doctors debate how -- and whether to -- try to get vaccinated ahead of schedule.At Mount Sinai Hospital, some doctors told others that you could talk your way into receiving a vaccine just by getting in line and repeating that you do "COVID-related procedures," one Mount Sinai doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, recalled.A doctor at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital said, "Clearly, we\'re ready to mow each other down for it."Many of the rumors have not been true. Still, they illustrate a growing distrust and "every man for himself" attitude, another Mount Sinai doctor said.Dr. Ramon Tallaj, who serves on a state task force advising the governor on the vaccine\'s rollout, said that ill-will and resentment would fade as the vaccine becomes more widely available."People are going to fight over who goes first, or who doesn\'t go first, but the important thing is that it\'s happening," Tallaj, chair of SOMOS Community Care, a network of clinics across New York City that treat many patients from Hispanic and Asian immigrant communities, said of the vaccinations.Health care workers and nursing home residents and staff members form what is called Phase 1 of New York state\'s vaccine distribution plan. About 2 million people are in this group, and the state\'s initial allocation of the vaccine most likely means that Phase 2, which includes essential workers, won\'t begin until late January. (Widespread distribution isn\'t likely to begin until the summer, officials have said.)But the state has left it mostly to each health care institution to devise a vaccination plan during the first phase. In the first week of vaccinations, many hospitals chose a wide variety of health care workers -- nurses, doctors, housekeepers -- from emergency rooms and intensive care units to be the first at their institutions to receive the vaccine. But in the days after the celebrations accompanying the first shots, the moods at hospitals have shifted.Asked about workers cutting the vaccine line at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian said in a statement, "We are proud to have vaccinated thousands of patient-facing employees in just over a week, and we will continue to do so until everyone receives a vaccine. We are following all New York State Department of Health guidelines on vaccine priority, with our initial focus on ICU and ED staff and equitable access for all."Still, The Times interviewed four health care workers at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, all of whom expressed resentment at colleagues and dismay that hospital administrators had allowed the vaccine distribution system to devolve.A nurse at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital said she had gone as far as to confront a social worker who she believed had jumped the line about why the social worker thought she deserved the vaccine ahead of others."She said, \'We have to go to ER sometime,\' but that\'s not true," the nurse said of the social worker.At some places, doctors and nurses who work in dedicated COVID-19 units were not included in the priority group. At Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, some of these nurses said they had yet to be vaccinated a week after vaccinations began."I think the sad thing is people are starting to turn against each other," one doctor who works at the hospital said. "Can you honestly say this clerk deserves it before I do? No, but nobody deserves it before anyone else."Another doctor working in an intensive care unit at the children\'s hospital recalled the scene last week: A group of staff members were striding energetically toward the elevator banks, where a vaccination station awaited. One of them even explained in passing that they were on their way to get the vaccine."It was a free-for-all," said the doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution from the hospital.Albanese, chief operating officer of the children\'s hospital, addressed the free-for-all in the email, placing some blame on the vaccination team for not limiting vaccinations to people on their list."We need to prioritize the highest risk teams," he wrote.At Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, the vaccine rollout has unfolded in plain view, in the hospital\'s atrium, which staff members crisscross throughout the work day or visit to grab a snack or coffee. Many doctors and nurses said they would glance over to see who was standing in line -- and whether that person fit the government\'s recommendations for those who should be prioritized."Despite our strict and stringent vaccination policies and procedures, we are aware of a handful of accusations of improprieties," Mount Sinai said in a statement. "Due to confidentiality, we cannot speak to any specific individual issue, however, any allegations of any missteps will be appropriately and thoroughly investigated.Last weekend, anesthesiologists -- who have played a crucial role in treating the sickest patients during the outbreak in New York -- complained that they had watched others get vaccinated before them.That led to the anonymous letter sent to hospital administrators."A boiling point was reached when we witnessed vaccines being administered, seemingly at random, to employees who were not a part of the originally-planned cohort," read the letter, which was sent anonymously in the name of "Concerned Faculty Members" of the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine. The letter was first reported by Politico.In interviews, several anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai noted that their colleagues at some other hospitals had already been vaccinated.The anesthesiologists said they expected to play a major role in the second wave if hospitalizations kept rising, and in recent days some in the department have gotten vaccinated.But just last week, an email from the head of the anesthesiology department, Dr. Andrew Leibowitz, asked for volunteers willing to work full time in a unit for critically ill COVID-19 patients if the outbreak worsened. Some in the department felt they were being told there might be an upside to volunteering."I am looking into the possibility of having persons volunteering to perform this duty possibly vaccinated earlier than they might otherwise be," Leibowitz wrote.Leibowitz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.One anesthesiologist said he recognized it was reasonable to vaccinate the volunteers first.But also, he said, it "felt that they were using the vaccine as a bargaining chip."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

And they\'ve largely been correct. On the other side: "Right now everybody thinks we’re going to get reflation — that’s real growth going forward," Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, told me on the latest Voices of Wall Street podcast.   * "If that morphs itself into inflation that could be [a problem] for financial markets throughout the second half of the year."Why it matters: Investors warn that rising inflation threatens the real economy and the stock market.  * "If we get to 2.6% or 2.7% on the core [inflation] number that’s the highest level we would have in 30 years," Bianco noted.   * "With the 10-year yield at 1.1% and with the stock market at a new high and a forward P/E ratio of 24 [times earnings] that’s going to be a problem for risk markets to see that kind of level of inflation even if the Fed says that they want that level of inflation."What to watch: Even though Fed chair Jerome Powell and other top officials have said they welcome inflation, Bianco warns they are not in charge.   * "If you look at the policy shifts from the Fed … the last two times the Fed has changed policy the market has forced it on them and forced it on them rather quickly," he added.  * The Fed "can lay out all the plans in the world that they want as long as the market is in agreement with them.

People learned about national vulnerabilities most had never considered, and about depths of resilience they never imagined needing except in wartime. Even the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, for all their horror and the two decades of war they ushered in, did not change day-to-day life in every city and town in the United States quite the way the coronavirus did. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times One president lost his job in large part for mishandling a crisis whose magnitude he first denied. His successor knows his legacy depends on bringing the catastrophe to a swift conclusion. The halting response demonstrated both the worst of American governance and then, from Operation Warp Speed’s 10-month sprint to vaccines to the frantic pace of inoculations in recent days, the very best. The economic earthquake as cities and towns shuttered so altered politics that Congress did something that would have been unimaginable a year ago this week. Lawmakers spent $5 trillion to dig the nation out of the economic hole created by the virus, and almost as a political aftershock, enacted an expansion of the social safety net larger than any seen since the creation of Medicare nearly 60 years ago. No country can go through this kind of trauma without being forever changed. There were indelible moments. In the spring came the racial reckoning brought on by the death of George Floyd after a police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. On Jan. 6 came the mob attack on the Capitol that led many to wonder whether American democracy was still capable of self-correction. But Biden’s message on Thursday centered on the theme that the country did finally come together in a common cause — vaccines as the road to normalcy — and from that could spring a glimmer of unity, as a still divided nation seeks solace in millions of tiny jabs in the arm. In his speech, Biden held out two distinct dates of hope: May 1, when all adults in the United States will be eligible to receive a vaccine, and July 4, when modest Independence Day celebrations might resemble life a little like it once was. Jill Lepore, a Harvard historian whose book “These Truths” tracks the changing dynamics of technology and society in America since its discovery, wondered if Americans were unconsciously considering the new year as starting in late March, as it did in Britain and its colonies until the calendar changed in 1752. “Or maybe it begins the day you get your vaccine,” she said. “Or the day enough of us get a vaccine.” For Biden, the question is when he will be able to pivot from what he has called the “rescue” phase of the pandemic to the “recovery” phase after the pandemic. In his speech on Thursday, the president made it clear that the rescue was still underway. His goal, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, said in an interview, is “laying up the next steps in this rescue and what, now that we’ve got this bill passed, are we really going to do in the coming months to get back toward a more normal way of life in this country.” All of Biden’s instincts tell him that declaring a move to recovery too soon carries dangers. It would signal that states could follow the example of Texas, eliminating mask mandates, opening restaurants and bars too quickly, and making themselves vulnerable to a resurgence — what Biden called “Neanderthal thinking.” He said as much in the speech, arguing, “This is not the time to let up.” “We need everyone to get vaccinated,” he said, an unspoken recognition that soon there may be more supply than willing takers. “Keep wearing a mask,” because “beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.” Though Biden made no mention of it, his top Cabinet members have emphasized that even eliminating the virus at home is not enough. As his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said last month, “Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it’s also going to be mutating.” “And if it’s mutating,” he added, “it’s also going to come back and bite people everywhere.” But the subtext of Biden’s message on Thursday evening, was that for the first time, people can begin to imagine a post-COVID world. After a year behind closed doors, the government can start to think about managing the virus to the point where it does not drive every policy decision, and families can find a way to go to dinner, or visit grandparents, without wondering whether it is a life-or-death decision. All of which raises the question of what will be permanently changed and what, when the history of this national trauma is written, will prove recoverable. And what will the country have learned? The past provides a mixed guide. There were too few lessons gleaned from the 1918 pandemic, an event that most history books overlooked, and that many Americans first heard about in any detail a century later, when it returned to afflict the nation in a different form. But in 1918, as in 2020, the president’s instinct was to play down its severity, invoking the odd logic that Americans would be dispirited by the truth even as their family and friends succumbed around them. President Donald Trump has never been a student of history (although his grandfather Frederick Trump died of the flu in 1918), and he told journalist Bob Woodward that “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down,” because “I don’t want to create a panic.” No one will know how many thousands of lives that cost as Trump ridiculed mask-wearing and did so little to promote the vaccine in the last days of his administration when it moved from laboratory to market in record time. “Denials for days, weeks, then months,” Biden said Thursday night, without ever mentioning his predecessor by name. “That led to more deaths, more infections, more stress and more loneliness." Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom Biden deliberately made his top medical adviser, also referred to those unnecessary deaths on Thursday when he said on NBC that a year ago this week, “it would have shocked me completely” to know that more than half a million Americans would die of the disease. But he noted that the country paid a horrific price for its political divisions. “Even simple common-sense health measures took on a political connotation,” he said. “It wasn’t a pure public health approach. It was very much influenced by the divisiveness we have in this country.” When Trump and his wife received the vaccine in January, they did not make it public. It was left to Biden and members of his administration to be inoculated on live television as an encouragement to those Americans fearful of the vaccine. The second big lesson may be that when properly organized, the same government that mobilized for World War II and landed men on the moon can in fact save lives on a mass scale. To the Biden administration, that meant taking the vaccines developed in record time and devising a vital distribution system. Operation Warp Speed “was very important work, and I don’t mean to minimize it,” Klain said. “But there was no plan for how we were going to get this vaccine into the arms of tens, and ultimately hundreds, of millions of Americans.” When the history of this strange moment is written, Biden will almost certainly be credited for getting a quarter of the adult population vaccinated with at least one shot, and 10% fully vaccinated, in his first 50 days. After years in which government was denigrated as more of an impediment to national greatness than a vehicle of progress, when conspiracy theories about a pernicious “deep state” still abound, he made the case on Thursday night that a simple show of government competence was itself a turning point. “What we don’t know is whether that translates into encouraging people into public service, or at least trusting that the government can get something done right,” said Richard Haass, a longtime diplomat and now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “After 9/11, we rose to the task of fighting global terrorism. After COVID-19, we rose to a different task.” “It remains to be seen,” he said, “whether we can now also use the moment to lessen the effects of domestic division.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

A retiree was fetching an online order for her side gig delivering groceries. A 25-year-old manager was at the front of the store, as always, happy to help. Then, for the second time in less than a week, another workaday American scene was shattered by a gunman’s deadly rampage — this one more than 1,000 miles from Atlanta, where families of the eight people killed in another shooting incident are still planning funerals. By the time it was over, 10 people were dead, including a Boulder police officer and at least three King Soopers employees. And people across Colorado, a state scarred by the legacy of the 1999 Columbine High School attacks and a barrage of other mass shootings, wondered in grief and fury how it had happened again, in their state, their college town of Boulder, their neighborhood supermarket. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It’s overwhelming,” said Frank DeAngelis, the former principal of Columbine High School, whose phone rings so often after new mass shootings that he has become the state’s grief-counselor-in-chief. “Colorado’s been through so much.” Law-enforcement officials said the 21-year-old suspect, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, had been armed with a handgun and military-style semi-automatic rifle and was wearing an armored vest when he carried out the attacks. In a detailed affidavit, investigators said the gunman began the rampage in the store’s parking lot, then pushed inside. Officer Eric Talley, 51, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder Police Department, was the first officer to reach the scene. Officers who swept into the store soon after found him with a bullet wound to the head and dragged his lifeless body back outside. The authorities identified the nine additional victims as Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Teri Leiker, 51; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65. Relatives and friends reached for celestial metaphors to describe the victims Tuesday, calling one woman a comet flaring across the sky and another a beam of light. Chief Maris Herold of the Boulder Police struggled to hold back her grief at a news conference in which she hailed Talley as “heroic” in his final call as a police officer. King Soopers workers said their slain colleagues had diligently worked on the front lines throughout the pandemic only to find themselves in the cross hairs of America’s relentless plague of mass shootings. Maggie Montoya, a pharmacy technician, was helping with coronavirus vaccinations when gunshots boomed through the aisles at about 2:40 p.m. Monday. A bullet cut down one of the patients who had been waiting in line. “Active shooter!” screamed a manager, and the workers and customers scrambled for their lives. As the gunshots drew closer to the room where Montoya, 25, and a colleague huddled together in hiding, she said she stopped trying to dial 911 and instead called her parents. “I wanted to hear their voice, for them to hear my voice in case it was the last time,” she said in an interview Tuesday. Alissa, who was shot and wounded in his leg, was charged with 10 counts of murder and was booked into the Boulder County Jail on Tuesday after being released from the hospital. He faces a possible penalty of life in prison without the chance of parole if he is convicted. Colorado abolished the death penalty last year. Law-enforcement officials did not offer a motive for the attacks, and said they were just beginning to sift through a sprawling crime scene and unravel Alissa’s past and his actions in the days leading up to the attack. Court records show he was born in Syria in 1999, his birth date happening to land just three days before the Columbine attacks in Littleton, Colorado. Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney, said Alissa had lived “most of his life in the United States.” Two classmates from Arvada West High School, where he had been on the wrestling team and graduated in 2018, said he had a short temper and anger problems. They recalled an incident in which Alissa punched another student during school. The Arvada Police Department said that Alissa had been convicted of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, in 2018 for a November 2017 incident in which Alissa “cold cocked” another student during class, then punched him in the head several more times. Alissa said the classmate had called him “racial names” weeks earlier, Arvada records show. He was also arrested on a criminal mischief charge in 2018. Brooke Campbell, 20, who managed the high school wrestling team while Alissa was on it, said he would get angry after losing wrestling matches or at seemingly unimportant things. “It’s scary, you know, looking back — that you knew someone that was capable of those things, or is now,” she said. “It kind of makes me sick.” Posts on the suspect’s now-deactivated Facebook page referenced wrestling, his martial arts achievements and Islam. In 2019, he shared a post that referred to passages from the Quran about the importance of being humble, kind and restraining anger, saying that the lessons were “What Islam is really about.” Another post from 2019 said simply, “#NeedAGirlfriend.” His brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, 34, told CNN that the suspect had grown increasingly paranoid starting around 2014 and believed he was being followed, chased or investigated. He once covered his computer’s camera with duct tape to keep from being spied on, his brother said. Family members did not respond to several messages seeking comment. According to an arrest affidavit from the Boulder police, Ahmad Alissa bought a Ruger AR-556 pistol on March 16 — the same day as the mass shootings at three massage parlors around Atlanta and just six days before the police say Alissa stormed into the supermarket. The gun is a short-barreled variant of an AR-15 carbine that is marketed as a pistol. A woman married to one of Ahmad Alissa’s brothers told investigators that she had seen the suspect playing with what she described as “a machine gun” two days before the attack at King Soopers, according to the affidavit. It was unclear whether she was describing any of the weapons used in the attack. The shooting touched off anguished new cries for tougher gun laws that reverberated Tuesday from Colorado, where Democratic lawmakers are pushing for a five-day waiting period on gun purchases, to the White House. President Joe Biden, saying he and the first lady were “devastated” by the attacks, made a new call to impose laws banning assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines. “This is not and should not be a partisan issue — it is an American issue,” Biden said. “We have to act.” The shootings in Boulder, which appear to be the deadliest in Boulder County’s history, cut a deep gash across Colorado communities that have been jolted again and again by sickeningly familiar active-shooter alerts. Since Columbine, there have been deadly public shootings at multiple high schools, a movie theater in Aurora, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. And on and on. Colorado politicians talked Tuesday about how they had shopped at the market that was now a bloody crime scene, or personally known a victim. They struggled to describe the grief and outrage of confronting a mass shooting in their backyard just six days after the shootings in Atlanta. “Flags had barely been raised back to full mast after the tragic shooting in Atlanta that claimed eight lives, and now a tragedy here, close to home, at a grocery store that could be any of our neighborhood grocery stores,” Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, said at a news conference. State Rep. Tom Sullivan, whose son, Alex, was among the 12 people killed in the Aurora theater attack in 2012, said the Boulder shooting demonstrated the urgency of passing new gun-control measures. The state Legislature is considering bills that would require guns to be locked or secured in houses with children, and to require gun owners to report any lost or stolen guns to the police. Sullivan is also pushing for Colorado to pass a five-day waiting period on gun purchases. “I know what last night was like,” he said, referring to the long wait before some families learn they will never be reunited with their loved ones. Across Boulder, the shoppers and workers who barely escaped the gunfire said they were still raw and numb and could barely begin to grieve. Kimberly Moore, 35, a pharmacy technician, said the gunman’s rampage ended not far from the room where she and her co-workers were hiding. For a half-hour, she said, they stayed as quiet as they could, hoping that their face masks muffled the sound of their breathing. Moore said she could hear the gunman firing what sounded like two deliberate shots into people: Bang bang. Bang bang. “You’re sitting there, completely exposed, listening to him kill everyone you know,” she said. Deb Grojean, a victims’ advocate with the Boulder Police Department who spent hours with witnesses Monday night, said one woman who survived the attack had recently moved from Dallas to Colorado in hopes of finding a safer place to live. The woman told Grojean that she and two other employees hid upstairs in a storage closet. “We think it’s inconceivable that this could happen in Boulder, but it’s proof it could happen anywhere,” Grojean said, and then asked a question swirling like the snow that crept over the mountains late Tuesday. “When is enough, enough?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a month-long lockdown from November 2, which will include the closure of restaurants, gyms and theaters.               Restrictions were also imposed to limit indoor gatherings to two households, as concerns that hospitals will be overwhelmed mount.

CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said individuals fully inoculated against COVID-19 can meet in small groups with other vaccinated people, in private settings such as homes, without wearing masks. “So what does this mean? If you and a friend or you and a family member are both vaccinated, you can have dinner together. You can visit your grandparents, if they have been vaccinated and you have been too.” She defined “fully vaccinated” as those who are two weeks past their second Pfizer or Moderna shot or Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine. Walensky also said fully vaccinated people can visit a single household of unvaccinated people without wearing masks if those not vaccinated are considered low-risk. Those fully vaccinated, however, should still wear masks when visiting unvaccinated people from multiple households. And they should continue with other precautions, such as avoiding medium- and large-sized in-person gatherings. "I think l important to realize as we\'re working through this that still over 90 percent of the population is not yet vaccinated, and that is our responsibility to make sure, in the context of 60,000 new cases a day, that we protect those who remain unvaccinated and remain vulnerable.” The recommendations come as about 30 million people, or 9.2% of the U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated. Millions more have had their first shot. As vaccinations accelerate to a record 2.2 million shots per day, cases and death continued to decline last week. Despite the positive trends, health officials have warned that the country could see a resurgence in cases as more infectious variants of the virus have been found in nearly every state. Over 525,000 people in the U.S. have died of the virus - or one in every 621 residents.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'e1751f0211a51b518aca270d5f465093', 'title': 'Surge of Student Suicides Pushes Las Vegas Schools to Reopen', 'description': 'The reminders of pandemic-driven suffering among students in Clark County, Nevada, have come in droves. Since schools shut their doors in March, an early warning system that monitors students’ mental health episodes has sent more than 3,100 alerts to district officials, raising alarms about suicidal thoughts, possible self-harm or cries for care. By December, 18 students had taken their own lives. The spate of student suicides in and around Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County district, the nation’s fifth largest, toward bringing students back as quickly as possible. This month, the school board gave the green light to phase in the return of some elementary school grades and groups of struggling students even as greater Las Vegas continues to post huge numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Superintendents across the nation are weighing the benefit of in-person education against the cost of public health, watching teachers and staff become sick and, in some cases, die, but also seeing the psychological and academic toll that school closings are having on children nearly a year in. The risk of student suicides has quietly stirred many district leaders, leading some, like the state superintendent in Arizona, to cite that fear in public pleas to help mitigate the virus’s spread. In Clark County, it forced the superintendent’s hand. “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the COVID numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, Clark County superintendent. “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope.” Adolescent suicide during the pandemic cannot conclusively be linked to school closures; national data on suicides in 2020 have yet to be compiled. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed an increase in the percentage of youth emergency room visits for mental health reasons during the pandemic. The actual number of those visits fell, although researchers noted that many people were avoiding hospitals that were dealing with the crush of coronavirus patients. And a compilation of emergency calls in more than 40 states among all age groups showed increased numbers related to mental health. Even in normal circumstances, suicides are impulsive, unpredictable and difficult to ascribe to specific causes. The pandemic has created conditions unlike anything mental health professionals have seen before, making causation more difficult to determine. But Greta Massetti, who studies the effects of violence and trauma on children at the CDC, said there was “definitely reason to be concerned because it makes conceptual sense.” Millions of children had relied on schools for mental health services that have now been restricted, she noted. In Clark County, 18 suicides over nine months of closure is double the nine the district had the entire previous year, Jara said. One student left a note saying he had nothing to look forward to. The youngest student he has lost to suicide was 9. “I feel responsible,” Jara said. “They’re all my kids.” Over the summer, as former President Donald Trump was trying to strong-arm schools into reopening, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, then the CDC director, warned that a rise in adolescent suicides would be one of the “substantial public health negative consequences” of school closings. Mental health groups and researchers released reports and resources to help schools, which provide counseling and other intervention services, reach students virtually. Mental health advocacy groups warned that the student demographics at the most risk for mental health declines before the pandemic — such as Black and LGBTQ students — were among those most marginalized by the school closures. But given the politically charged atmosphere this past summer, many of those warnings were dismissed as scare tactics. Parents of students who have taken their lives say connecting suicide to school closings became almost taboo. A video that Brad Hunstable made in April, two days after he buried his 12-year-old son, Hayden, in their hometown, Aledo, Texas, went viral after he proclaimed, “My son died from the coronavirus.” But, he added, “not in the way you think.” In a recent interview, Hunstable spoke of the challenges his son faced during the lockdown — he missed friends and football, and had become consumed by the video game Fortnite. He hanged himself four days before his 13th birthday. Hayden’s story is the subject of a short documentary, “Almost 13,” Hunstable’s video has more than 86,000 views on YouTube, and an organization created in his son’s name has drawn attention from parents across the country, clearly striking a chord. “I wasn’t trying to make a political statement,” Hunstable said. “I was trying to help save lives.” This fall, when most school districts decided not to reopen, more parents began to speak out. The parents of a 14-year-old boy in Maryland who killed himself in October described how their son “gave up” after his district decided not to return in the fall. In December, an 11-year-old boy in Sacramento shot himself during his Zoom class. Weeks later, the father of a teenager in Maine attributed his son’s suicide to the isolation of the pandemic. “We knew he was upset because he was no longer able to participate in his school activities, football,” Jay Smith told a local television station. “We never guessed it was this bad.” President Joe Biden has laid out a robust plan to speed vaccinations, expand coronavirus testing and spend billions of dollars to help districts reopen most of their schools in his first 100 days in office. By then, children in districts like Clark County, with more than 300,000 students, will have been out of school for more than a year. “Every day, it feels like we have run out time,” Jara said. Heading into the pandemic, youth suicide rates had been on the rise for a decade; by 2018, suicide had become the second-leading cause of death for youth and young adults, behind accidents. And the most recent behavioral risk survey, which was released last year by the CDC and tracks health trends of high school students, showed a steady rise over the last decade in the percentage of students who said they felt persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, as well as in those who planned and tried suicide. Since the lockdowns, districts are reporting suicide clusters, Massetti of the CDC said, and many said they were struggling to connect students with services. “Without in-person instruction, there is a gap that is right now being unfilled,” she said. Suzie Button, senior clinical director for high school programming at the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit based in New York that works on suicide prevention, said hundreds of schools and colleges — including Clark County’s — are teaming up with the organization to create services to offer students during the pandemic. “There’s a lot we don’t know, but what we do know about schools is they are the nexus of adolescent life,” Button said. “And in times like this, young people are sometimes the canaries in the coal mine.” Like many school districts, the Clark County school system marshaled its resources to plug gaps in services to its students. Truancy officers started doing wellness checks, school psychologists were working overtime, teachers were trained to look for trauma cues on screens, and school resource officers became the chief liaisons between the district and the coroner’s office. By July, after the sixth suicide since March, the district invested in a program, the GoGuardian Beacon alert system, to send reports of mild to severe suicide risk. The system, which scans student writings on district-issued iPads, generated more than 3,100 alerts from June to October, indicating behavior such as suicide research, self-harm, written comments, or just the need for help or support. By November, the deluge forced the district to upgrade its contract to include 24-hour monitoring and a service that would sort out the most severe cases, like students who were in “active planning,” meaning they had identified a methodology and were ready to act. “I couldn’t sleep with my phone nearby anymore,” Jara said. “It was like a 24-hour reminder that we need to get our schools open.” Recent graduates have also been affected. Anthony Orr, 18, drove his car to a parking lot in August and shot himself with an AR-15 he had bought two weeks before. In the months since, his parents, Marc and Pamela, have looked for signs they may have missed. His father did not know anything was wrong until he found his son’s body in the car, grabbed his arm and asked, “Son, what have you done?” The teenager, whose brother is a teacher in the district, seemed happy — he had graduated a couple of months before, decided that he wanted to take up a trade instead of going to college, and was settling in at his new job, where he had made friends. The only disappointment he had expressed was that his senior year was disrupted and that prom and his sports seasons were canceled. But he had met his goal to graduate with advanced honors, and he wore a white gown to a socially distanced, scaled-back ceremony that noted the achievement. “That was a letdown for him, too. There wasn’t the pomp and circumstance,” his father said. “They did it nice, they got to run across the stage and get the paper, but it definitely took away from the party.” His mother, Pamela, did not know whether quarantine pushed him over the edge, but she said: “Our kids are feeling hopeless. They’re feeling like there’s no future for them. I can’t see how there’s any other explanation.” In November, school officials intervened when a 12-year-old student searched his district-issued iPad for “how to make a noose.” The boy’s grandfather, whom The New York Times is identifying by his first name, Larry, to protect the boy’s identity, said the episode was a shock. The boy’s father had retired to bed around 7 p.m. to rest for his 2 a.m. work shift. He did not hear the phone ringing until around 10 p.m., when the school district finally reached him. His father made it to his son’s room to find a noose from multiple shoestrings around his neck. “If there wasn’t a security device that triggers that kind of alert, we would not be having this discussion,” his grandfather said. “It absolutely consumes you.” His grandson, whose dog died during the pandemic, was doing well academically in virtual school but was “Zoomed out,” Larry said. The only indication the boy has given for what pushed him over the edge is saying repeatedly, “I miss my friends.” “He is having a hard time functioning in this isolation,” his grandfather said. “It goes against everything that he is. There has to be an option of letting these kids go to school.” A dozen schools in the district began a pilot program to allow for face-to-face counseling. Recently, the number of schools swelled to 68. The program has led to interventions in 30 cases where students were considering suicide. The pilot has “grown into a monster,” said John Anzalone, principal at one of the initial 12 schools, Sierra Vista High School. He knew that his diverse, largely working-class student population, whose families have suffered from Las Vegas’ tourism crash, would be hit hard by the virus. But he was still stunned by the effect. “These young people are having to grow up really, really fast,” he said. “Some were alone even before the pandemic because their parents were working, and some are the breadwinners now.” Adrienne, mother of a 14-year-old high school freshman, had just finished a 12-hour shift last month when she received a call from her son’s principal, alerting her that her son had expressed suicidal thoughts. The teenager had told a friend that if they called the police, he would “do it.” “He felt disconnected,” his mother said. “He felt left behind.” His father had lost his small business. Two family members had died, one to the coronavirus. His mother was working 70 hours a week. Even when she was at home, she was not entirely present, as she tended to work and home life. “He just felt like he had no control over his world anymore and felt like a burden,” Adrienne said. “He loves to help people, to make people laugh, and he feels like he’s failing.” Indeed, its student failure rate, ranging from 60% to 70%, is another crisis at the school. That, in turn, is depressing the teachers and staff. The district is conducting a survey to see what supports it needs to provide its employees. Colleen Neely, a counselor at Shadow Ridge High School, recalled how a young man she had advised since ninth grade used to stand outside her office every day after fourth period. He had overcome so much by the 2019-20 school year in his determination to graduate: When he was junior, he was homeless, and the school connected him to a shelter; for a week, he lived in a park near the school, and staff gave him food and other resources; his schedule was shortened so he could work at McDonald’s. In the spring of 2020, Neely sent the young man an email telling him how proud she was of him, that he was so close to getting what he wanted. Two weeks before graduation, she got the call that he had shot himself. “Part of me will always wonder if he’d had access to his teachers, and his peers, and me, if it would’ve changed the outcome,” Neely said through tears. “I will never know. These suicides, they don’t impact one person and one family. They impact me to this day.” Jara understood. “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” he confessed. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 3}

At least one dose has been administered to over 25 per cent of Israel’s 9.25 million population, with just over 10.5 per cent having received a second dose. Working its way down its priority list, the vaccine in Israel is now available to anyone over 40 or, with parental permission, those aged between 16 and 18. The winter matriculation certificate is a large part of university and military admissions. Israel struck a deal with Pfizer at the beginning of January that allowed them to expedite delivery of the vaccine so that all over 16s would be inoculated by the end of March, in return for extensive data on their vaccination campaign to share with the world. Israeli health minister, Yuli Edelstein, told The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the data from their vaccination programme suggests a first dose gave just 30 per cent protection from coronavirus. “We are just at the beginning of the (vaccination) campaign, we do see cases of people that after getting the first dose still get sick with the coronavirus,” he said.', 'num_of_covid': 3}

On Lindell’s “Vocl” social media platform, users will be free to claim that a supercomputer stole the election from Donald Trump, or that vaccines are a tool of the devil.Any new social media network faces serious challenges. But Vocl must grapple with a daunting problem before it even launches: a website called “Vocal,” spelled with an “A,” already exists.On Thursday, lawyers for Vocal’s publicly traded parent company, Creatd, Inc., warned Lindell, in a letter reviewed by The Daily Beast, to change his social media network’s name and surrender ownership of the Vocl.com domain name. If Lindell refuses to change the name, he could face a lawsuit.While Lindell has promised to turn Vocl into a “cross between Twitter and YouTube,” Vocal is a publishing platform similar to Medium where writers can post and monetize articles.“It is clear that you are acting with bad faith and with intent to profit from Creatd’s mark,” the letter reads, claiming Lindell’s Vocl would “tarnish” the Vocal brand.“It’s not like anything you’ve ever seen,” Lindell previously told Insider, describing his similarly named social network. “It’s all about being able to be vocal again and not to be walking on eggshells.”Creatd owns the trademark for using “Vocal” in a number of ways related to social networking, including creating “virtual communities” and “online networking services.” Along with surrendering ownership of the Vocl.com domain name, Creatd wants Lindell to destroy any products with Vocl branding and never use the name again.“Creatd is prepared to take all steps necessary to protect Creatd’s valuable intellectual property rights, without further notice to you,” the letter reads.When asked on Friday morning about the new legal warning, the embattled MyPillow CEO and Trump friend replied, “It has nothing to do with their trademark. I haven't even launched yet. But it has nothing to do with us.”Lindell claims Vocl is also an acronym.“Ours stands for the ‘Victory of Christ's Love,’” Lindell added.Dominion Says It Will Sue MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell Over Election Fraud Claims Early Friday afternoon, he called back to say, “We looked into it, and we believe it would be confusing, so we are going to announce a different name and URL by Monday.”Lindell is already facing one major lawsuit. In February, voting-tech company Voting Systems sued Lindell and MyPillow over his baseless allegations that Dominion was involved in a scandalous election theft. Concurrently, Lindell, with the help of Trump attorney and Gawker-slayer Charles Harder, has also recently sued the Daily Mail tabloid, over the publication’s January article that the Trump pal had a “secret romance” with 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star Jane Krakowski, a story that both parties have flatly denied.For years, the pillow mogul has been a personal friend of former President Donald Trump, and a diehard MAGA supporter and campaigner. During the 2020 presidential election, Lindell served as Trump 2020’s Minnesota co-chair, and following Trump’s loss in the Electoral-College and popular vote to Democrat Joe Biden, the MyPillow CEO became one of the loudest voices in the country supporting the broader Trump effort to nullify the outcome of the presidential race. (Trump’s anti-democratic crusade on this, of course, climaxed with his instigation of the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, an event that led to the ex-president’s second impeachment in the House.)During the tumultuous presidential transition period, Lindell was a major behind-the-scenes funder of several efforts to challenge the 2020 results, and near the very end of Trump’s term even visited the then-president at the White House to brief him on discredited documents alleging that China and other foreign nations helped hack the election and throw it to Biden. Ever since the start of the Biden era, Lindell has not given up aggressively promoting the fiction that Trump actually won, even as it has resulted in his banishment from certain social media platforms, his business getting shunned by other companies, and ballooning legal risk.Alternative social media networks aimed at conservatives have been challenged by hacks and other technical issues, but Lindell claims Vocl won’t face those problems. Hackers recently hit far-right social network Gab, while social media platform Parler went offline for a month after the U.S. Capitol riot when Amazon Web Services pulled support for its hosting. In contrast, Lindell told Insider that Vocl will have its own servers, with “space-age stuff” to prevent hacking.Lindell told Insider that Vocl has a staff of roughly 10 people, but declined to describe them or where they’re working “for their safety.”Vocl users will be free to promote conspiracy theories about election fraud and vaccines, according to a speech Lindell gave Wednesday at a rally in Arizona.“Every word out of their mouths is going to say Dominion, Smartmatic fraud, vaccine fraud,” Lindell told the cheering crowd, describing the content on Vocl.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Porsa, the CEO of Harris Health System, which treats thousands of mostly uninsured patients, warned Friday that its entire vaccine supply could be depleted by midday Saturday. The problem is not one of capability — the vaccination centers he oversees have easily been administering as many as 2,000 vaccines a day — but of availability. “All of a sudden the distribution of vaccines stopped,” Porsa said. “It’s perplexing and frustrating because I keep hearing that there are high percentages of vaccines that have been distributed but not administered.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times In the midst of one of the deadliest phases of the pandemic in the United States, health officials in Texas and around the country are growing desperate, unable to get clear answers as to why the long-anticipated vaccines are suddenly in short supply. Inoculation sites are canceling thousands of appointments in one state after another as the nation’s vaccines roll out through a bewildering patchwork of distribution networks, with local officials uncertain about what supplies they will have in hand. In South Carolina, one hospital in the city of Beaufort had to cancel 6,000 vaccine appointments after it received only 450 of the doses it expected. In Hawaii, a Maui hospital canceled 5,000 first-dose appointments and put 15,000 additional requests for appointments on hold. In San Francisco, the public health department had at one point expected to run out of vaccines this past week because the city’s allocation dropped sharply from a week ago and California officials temporarily had to put thousands of doses on hold after a higher than usual number of possible allergic reactions were reported. In New York state, officials in Erie County have canceled thousands of vaccine appointments in recent days after a sharp decline in allocations from the state. The situation is especially dire in Texas, which is averaging about 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day, fueling concerns over whether officials will be able to curb the spread when they cannot get their hands on the vaccines they desperately need to do so. Health officials trying to piece together why this is happening are puzzled by reports that millions of available doses are going unused. As of Friday morning, nearly 39.9 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had been distributed to state and local governments, but only about 19.1 million doses had been administered to patients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pfizer and Moderna have each agreed to provide the United States with 100 million vaccine doses, and the companies are racing to manufacture the vaccines, together releasing between 12 million and 18 million doses a week. At that rate, it is feasible for the new administration to meet President Joe Biden’s pledge to inject 100 million vaccines by his 100th day in office. Public health officials could even potentially ramp up the pace of vaccinations with existing supply. It appears that problems with distributing the already available doses are responsible for many of the acute vaccine shortages now being seen in parts of the country. Factor in the ever-increasing demand as more states make the vaccine widely available to those 65 and older, and officials warn that distribution headaches could persist in the weeks ahead. The Biden administration has pledged to overhaul distribution to the states and even use the Defense Production Act to increase supply, but vaccine experts warn that shortages of the doses will persist in the short term with manufacturing sites already facing capacity constraints. State and local governments, as well as hospital administrators, are fending for themselves. In Houston, Porsa said his staff was scrambling as the supply of vaccines dwindled this past week, squeezing six doses out of vials intended to provide five. In one sign of the confusion around vaccine distribution in Texas, officials in Dallas County scrapped a plan that would have prioritized shots for people living in heavily Black and Latino communities hit hardest by the virus. Texas state officials threatened to slash allocations of the vaccine if the county went ahead with the plan even though data showed that most of the shots administered in Dallas County had been in wealthier neighborhoods. Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, is now struggling with a similar problem as the hospitals serving some of its poorest residents run out of the vaccine, prompting some public health experts to question why doses are not being made more available to vulnerable communities. “These are our front-line workers who are at the greatest risk of contracting the virus and at the greatest risk of spreading it to others,” said Vivian Ho, a health economist at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine. “We would be able to resolve the pandemic in Harris County quicker if we could get a sufficient number of vaccines,” she added, referring to the county encompassing much of Houston. Adding to the turmoil, just days after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, praised the state’s vaccine rollout at a meeting in Houston where Democratic city and county officials were excluded from participating, the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, also a Republican, sent a letter Thursday to the state’s Expert Vaccination Allocation Panel urging its members to fix the problems. “Right now, in many cities and counties when an announcement of available vaccinations is made, website sign-up pages crash and phone calls go unanswered,” Patrick said in the letter. “Texans need to have a better understanding of the time it will take for everyone to be vaccinated in order to reduce lines, confusion and frustration.” The sense of chaos afflicting the distribution efforts, not just in Texas but in an array of states, is laying bare how local officials are struggling to fill the void left by the lack, until this week, of a comprehensive response at the federal level. Dr. George Rutherford, a public health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, said the most obvious problem with vaccine administration in the San Francisco area was clear. “There’s not enough doses, period,” he said. “That’s it. Everything would work fine if you had enough doses.” The public health department in San Francisco and hospitals in the city were “caught by surprise” by the lack of doses, Rutherford said, and by the eligibility expansion to those 65 and older, which likely strained the system. Varying vaccine distribution channels — such as Kaiser Permanente and UC San Francisco — receive the doses on their own, he said, further complicating an already convoluted distribution system. “So it’s a little hard for the city to understand exactly what’s left over, what they need to do, where the holes are to fill,” Rutherford said. Still, new vaccination sites are opening in San Francisco, which Rutherford said would help speed the process along once more doses become available. “There’s this tension between efficiency and equity,” he said. “It’s never easy.” Dr. Grant Colfax, head of the San Francisco Department of Health, said the city was “very close to doses running out” and said a lack of overall coordination has led to distribution problems. “I think what this really is, is a continuation of the fallout of the lack of a coordinated federal response,” he said. “Basically cities and counties were left on our own to deal with this pandemic.” He said local jurisdictions “simply did not have the resources and the capacity” to handle the complicated effort without help. “It has manifested in a very tragic way.” In Austin, Texas, Curt Fisher, a 76-year-old who has served on the boards of several high-tech startups, experienced firsthand the confounding roadblocks to securing a vaccine. He was playing golf with friends several weeks ago when they learned that Austin Public Health had vaccines available. They quickly registered with their cellphones from the golf course and landed appointments in a matter of minutes. The system was deluged, and Fisher, who had waited about 30 minutes to call, missed out. He doggedly checked the website from his home about four or five times a day for more than three weeks. Each attempt bore the same result: no vaccines available within the maximum 100-mile search radius. Then after days of pinning his hopes on his hometown health service, good fortune finally came from more than 150 miles away. He received a text from a Memorial Hermann hospital in Houston, where he was automatically registered because he had seen a doctor about three months earlier, inviting him to come to the hospital for his first dose of the vaccine. He made the roughly three-hour drive Monday, spending about an hour at the hospital with little waiting for his first shot of the vaccine. He is supposed to go back Feb. 8 for the second and final injection. Looking back, Fisher said the success he found in Houston and the hassles he went through in Austin illustrated that some vaccine distribution centers “really have their act together” and others do not. “I don’t think the system that Austin Health had could handle the stress of the high volume, obviously,” he said. But some people have struggled to get vaccine appointments, only to see them canceled because of supply problems. Jeanelle Fernandes, 33, who has sickle cell anemia and lives in Miami, initially felt relieved after setting up a vaccine appointment for Jan. 28. Having it confirmed “was kind of like a light at the end of the tunnel,” she said. “This has been a really hard journey for me.” But then Baptist Health South Florida tweeted this week that all first-dose vaccine appointments scheduled for Jan. 20 or later would be canceled. “I’m definitely frustrated,” she said. It was not the hospital’s fault, she said; she blamed a government that seemed unprepared to roll out millions of vaccine doses when people urgently needed them. “Now I have to wait,” Fernandes said. “I’m up in the air. I don’t know what’s going to happen.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The legislation, spearheaded by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), will likely be added to President Biden\'s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package. Biden wants his American Rescue Plan to use an expanded child tax credit to cut the the child poverty rate in half. The White House and Senate Democrats have reviewed Neal\'s proposal and support it, the Post reports, though it may have to be modified to meet the strict, peculiar rules of the Senate budget reconciliation process. Under the plan, the IRS would send $250-300 monthly payments to households for a year, though some Democrats have said they would push to make the allowances permanent later this year. Unlike more generous payments proposed last week by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Neal\'s legislation starts phasing out the checks for families earning $150,000 a year, or $75,000 for individual parents. Romney\'s plan would also have the Social Security Administration handle the payments and offset the cost by eliminating or trimming other welfare programs. Neal\'s proposal is estimated to cost $120 billion a year, and a Columbia University analysis found it would cut the number of children in poverty by as much as 54 percent, or 5 million children. "America has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in part because it spends less on child benefits than almost any other," the Post reports. "The pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it\'s devastating," Neal said in a statement. "This money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone\'s head or food on their table. This is how the tax code is supposed to work for those who need it most." Many Republicans and conservative groups responded negatively to Romney\'s plan and they are even less likely to support Neal\'s.

{'_id': 'c6596d432ab54e94725ff4b2f6893e18', 'title': 'The looming stimulus deal is a dispiriting harbinger of the endless gridlock to come', 'description': 'Seven months after the House passed the $3 trillion HEROES Act that died in the Senate, and days after the U.S. COVID-19 death toll eclipsed 300,000, congressional leaders are on the verge of finalizing, at long last, a second round of stimulus spending for the beleaguered U.S. economy.The rescue package is likely to include direct payments to all Americans, funding for vaccine rollout and delivery, and an extension of unemployment benefits as well as much-needed aid to small businesses. The total price tag looks to come in at around $900 billion. Left out, as far as we know, will be funding for cash-strapped state and local governments, a worrying sign that Republicans are bent on returning to their pre-Trump commitment to pointless austerity now that Democrat Joe Biden is headed to the White House.Something is certainly better than nothing. But long, contentious negotiations resulting in de facto austerity for millions of Americans, looming bankruptcies and service cuts for states and cities, and impunity for companies willfully endangering their employees are a dispiriting harbinger of the endless gridlock to come should Republicans hold the Senate. Instead of Democrats setting the agenda in Washington, the key player will remain Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who will have no conceivable reason to compromise or play fair. Why should he? He\'s been playing the same ruthless game for more than a decade now, and voters keep giving the gavel back to him.While it will help some weather the months of misery to come, the deal represents a catastrophic strategic failure for Democrats. Throughout the fall, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) refused to take up a similar but larger $1.8 trillion package on offer from the White House. While there were legitimate doubts about whether it had any chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate (or if President Trump\'s White House would honor an agreement), the real holdup was Pelosi\'s not unreasonable belief that Democrats were about to sweep into power in the Senate and increase their House advantage. That obviously didn\'t happen, although the upper chamber is still in play. Holding out for more money and for McConnell to fold on his insistence on shielding companies from liability if they endanger the lives of their workers, Pelosi in the end looks like she might get neither.Pelosi, of course, was hardly the only person in D.C. who thought Republicans were going to get dismissed with prejudice from government on November 3rd. More than anything, these rancorous stimulus negotiations are a terrifying preview of post-pandemic life under divided government if Democrats fail to sweep the Georgia Senate runoffs on January 5th. If you thought the last six years of the Obama administration were fun — non-stop budget standoffs, fiscal cliff brinksmanship, government shutdowns, and the deliberate muzzling of the post-Great Recession recovery — you\'ll love the coming showdowns between the Biden administration and an emboldened Republican Senate.After years of feeding paper into the money printer, letting it go whirr, and reaping the political benefits of what the outgoing president constantly called "the greatest economy in history," Senate Republicans will now do everything in their power to bring it all crashing down around them. Their relentless obsession with deficits, which they had conveniently left back in the Obama era along with their concern about dead Americans and the "McConnell Rule" about Supreme Court appointments in an election year, will return with a vengeance. They will use the opportunity of the economic recession to put pressure on states and municipalities to slash spending and services, and to continue hollowing out the capacity of the public sector. Like Obama, Biden will suffer politically from the slow recovery inflicted on him by Republican obstruction.Amazingly, Biden is still running around telling reporters he thinks he can change this. Just this week he predicted that "...as Donald Trump\'s shadow fades away, you\'re going to see an awful lot of change." After six to eight months, Biden claimed, the Republicans who keep telling him in private that they will work with him will come around.Six to eight months? What exactly will be happening in the interim, especially if Biden also believes there are strict limits on his executive power? Why is he still talking about winning Republicans over, instead of defeating them? He\'s the one who carried Georgia, and he should stay camped out there for the next month trying to bring a Democratic Senate across the line. Retire the happy talk and give it to the voters straight: It\'s either us, or it\'s two years of unbearable paralysis.Maybe Biden felt like he needed to indulge these delusions to get elected president. But the belief that his Republican counterparts are basically decent people whose fevers will break once the pathogen of Donald Trump exits the body politic was part of the problem all along. It convinced too many people that the only problem was Trump and not the political party that spent four years covering up his crimes and abuses and then actively joining his assault on American democracy and decency. It failed to tie the administration\'s catastrophic COVID mismanagement to the congressional GOP\'s sycophantic obeisance to Trump\'s laziness, ineptitude, and indifference to widespread misery.The reward for that blind trust in the goodness of Republicans, cultivated by Biden and other Democrats who chose to turn the Democratic National Convention into an advertisement for Republican defectors, was for the GOP to turn right around and endorse the president\'s sordid plot against the republic. Last week, 126 Republican members of the House endorsed the preposterous plan to have GOP state legislators appoint their own slate of electors, and to hand the election to the man who lost it. Even if the lot of them knew that this attempted coup was doomed to fail in court, it will go down as one of the most shameful episodes in modern American history.It wasn\'t just the famously reactionary House GOP either. A number of Senate Republicans were in on the conspiracy, including Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah). The runner-up in the 2016 Republican primary, Ted Cruz (R-Texas) offered to argue these ridiculous cases before the Supreme Court. Does Biden think that a few months after trying to literally overthrow the duly elected government of the United States, these same senators are going to have such a huge change of heart that they will agree to work with him for the good of the people? I hope Biden keeps a large supply of hot sauce and some Himalayan sea salt on hand, because when he eats those words he\'ll need help getting them down.Given the dire circumstances facing millions of Americans, though, and the long-shot nature of winning both Georgia runoffs, Democrats are making the right call to compromise on a stimulus package. If McConnell retains his Senate majority, there will likely be no help at all for anyone, and that\'s too big a risk to take.For restaurateurs and other business owners whose bottom lines are dependent on the long-lost face-to-face contact of the Before Times, this could be the difference between a long winter of slowly going broke, and surviving until the vaccine makes in-person gatherings safe again sometime in the spring. And while $600 per person (the rumored number for direct payments) is woefully inadequate to the task of repairing the vast economic damage wrought by the pandemic and the federal government\'s embarrassing failure to address it, putting cash directly into people\'s pockets helped avert the worst when COVID-19 first washed up on these shores.It\'s worth trying again, even if it\'s not enough. Of course, with negotiations ongoing, we could still end up with no deal at all, or perhaps an agreement in which Democrats get more. But if they don\'t like this already tiresome dynamic, Biden and his allies need to make the Georgia runoffs the focus of their political lives, or else resign themselves to another term for McConnell\'s informal presidency.More stories from theweek.com  The plan to disinfect the White House before Biden moves in is a \'huge waste of time and effort,\' experts say  Report: Of the hundreds of people invited to Mike Pompeo\'s indoor holiday party, a few dozen showed up  Joe Biden still doesn\'t get it', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Twenty-six of the people received pardons, and three got commuted sentences. Manafort and Stone, a longtime Trump political confidant, were convicted as part of the federal investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort was sentenced to seven years for bank and tax fraud, and other crimes. He was released to home confinement in May due to coronavirus concerns. Stone was charged with lying to Congress, but Trump commuted his 40-month sentence in July. Charles Kushner, Jared Kushner\'s father, served two years for tax fraud and witness tampering. [NPR, The New York Times] 2.President Trump on Wednesday followed through on his vow to veto the annual defense bill, saying it "would put the interests of Washington, D.C., establishment over those of the American people." Trump also criticized a provision in the bill that would let the military remove the names of Confederate leaders from military bases. The Senate and the House approved the legislation with veto-proof bipartisan majorities, signaling that Congress could respond by overriding Trump for the first time in his presidency. In anticipation of the veto, lawmakers are scheduled to return from holiday break and meet next week to vote and potentially override Trump. "I would hope we would be able to override the veto," Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said last weekend. [The Washington Post, The New York Times] 3.Pfizer on Wednesday agreed to provide the United States with another 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech. The deal, reached after negotiations with the Trump administration, will double the U.S. order, providing enough of the two-dose vaccine for 100 million people. The federal government will pay $1.95 billion for the extra supply. The doses will be delivered by July. The deal won\'t increase the number of people who will get the Pfizer vaccine in the next few months, but it will help prevent a shortage come summer. Pfizer and Moderna, which also has started shipping its vaccine, will supply the government with a combined 400 million doses, enough for 200 million Americans. So far, 18.3 million people in the U.S. have been infected with the virus, and nearly 324,000 have died. [The Washington Post] 4.Republicans scrambled on Wednesday to salvage the $900 billion coronavirus relief package after President Trump slammed it as a "disgrace" filled with spending unrelated to the pandemic and demanded that lawmakers increase stimulus checks to individuals from $600 to $2,000. Trump\'s suggestion that he would not sign the legislation without revisions threw its future in doubt as many Americans stand to lose extra pandemic-related unemployment benefits this week. The relief package also is tied to a $1.4 trillion spending deal needed to avert a government shutdown. Congressional Democrats, who tried for months to push through a multi-trillion dollar relief package, are calling Trump\'s bluff and moving Thursday, Christmas Eve, to propose a stand-alone bill to provide $2,000 stimulus checks. [The New York Times] 5.Attorney General William Barr ended his final day on the job with a farewell note saying "it has been a great honor to serve once again in this role." Barr first held the job under President George H.W. Bush. Barr thanked the "dedicated" staff of the department and said they "have risen to meet historic challenges and uphold our vital mission to enforce the rule of law." Barr was long considered one of President Trump\'s closest allies, but a rift seemingly grew between the two in recent weeks after Barr didn\'t buy into Trump\'s efforts to overturn the presidential election. Trump announced this month that Barr would be leaving. His departure comes as Trump continues to push Republicans to somehow reverse his election defeat weeks ahead of President-elect Joe Biden\'s inauguration. [CBS News, New York Post] 6.The federal government released a flurry of fresh economic data on Wednesday that boosted fears that the economic recovery was faltering as coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths surged. Consumers cut spending last month by 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported. The drop, the first in seven months, came after a burst of shopping over the summer. Spending dropped on services, including restaurant meals, and on goods, including cars, appliances, and other big-ticket items. Household incomes also fell, losing 1.1 percent in their third decline in four months. New applications for unemployment benefits retreated from a three-month high but remained elevated. The Labor Department reported that 803,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, down from a revised 892,000 the prior week. [The Wall Street Journal] 7.A provincial court in Pakistan on Thursday ordered the release of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the man convicted in 2002 as the mastermind of the kidnapping and murder of The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The Sindh High Court in Karachi set aside Sheikh\'s death sentence in April, and downgraded his conviction from terrorism, kidnapping, and murder to the lesser crime of kidnapping. That carries a maximum sentence of seven years, so Sheikh, who had served 18 years, was eligible for release. The same court overturned the convictions of three accomplices who had been sentenced to life in prison. Pearl\'s family is appealing Sheikh\'s acquittal on the murder charge. Pakistani authorities had used emergency detention powers to keep Sheikh and the three others in prison. [The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal] 8.Gunmen attacked a village in the western Benishangul-Gumuz region of Ethiopia on Wednesday, killing more than 100 people, the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said. The area has been plagued with ethnic violence. Several ethnic groups live in the region, including the Gumuz people. In recent years, some Gomuz have complained that farmers and businessmen who have moved in from the neighboring Amhara region have taken fertile land. Some Amhara leaders claim the land rightfully belongs to them. Ethiopia, Africa\'s second most populous country, has been plagued by violence in other areas since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was appointed in 2018 and intensified a push for democratic reforms. [Reuters] 9.Columbus, Ohio, Mayor Andrew Ginther on Wednesday called for the firing of police officer Adam Coy, who fatally shot an unarmed Black man, Andre Hill, on Tuesday. City Council President Shannon Hardin called for Coy to be arrested, calling Hill\'s death an "unjustified killing." Coy, who is white, responded to a non-emergency call about a man sitting inside a car, repeatedly turning it on and off. Body-camera footage showed that Coy shot Hill, 47, less than 10 seconds into the encounter, and that several minutes elapsed before an officer and the female officer with him rendered aid. Coy failed to activate his body camera before the shooting, but a "look back" feature recorded video with no audio of the 60 seconds before it was activated. Coy already is facing disciplinary charges that could lead to his firing. [Columbus Dispatch, NPR] 10.The NBA postponed the Houston Rockets\' Wednesday season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder because the Rockets lacked the eight available players required by the basketball league. The team was left shorthanded after three players returned positive or inconclusive coronavirus tests, and four others were quarantined under the NBA\'s contact tracing protocol. Another player, Chris Clemons, was not available due to injury, and Rockets star James Harden was "unavailable due to a violation of the Health and Safety Protocol" based on a video, published by Black Sports Online, showing him maskless at a Houston club, the league said. Harden also was fined $50,000. Houston\'s next scheduled game is Saturday against the Portland Trail Blazers.

Nora Carol Photography/Getty ImagesThe Internal Revenue Service has postponed the April 15 tax filing deadline to May 17. If taxpayers need even more time to file federal returns, the agency added, they can request an extension until Oct. 15. “This continues to be a tough time for many people, and the IRS wants to continue to do everything possible to help taxpayers navigate the unusual circumstances related to the pandemic, while also working on important tax administration responsibilities,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. The announcement may come as welcome news for many Americans, but it also raises an important question: Why should taxpayers have to navigate the tedious, costly tax filing system at all? The case for a ‘simple return’ In 1985, President Ronald Reagan promised a “return-free” tax system in which half of all Americans would never fill out a tax return again. Under the framework, taxpayers with simple returns would automatically receive a refund or a letter detailing any tax owed. Taxpayers with more complicated returns would use the system in place today. In 2006, President Barack Obama’s chief economist, Austan Goolsbee, premiered the “simple return,” where taxpayers would receive already completed tax forms for their review or correction. Goolsbee estimated his system would save taxpayers more than US$2 billion a year in tax preparation fees. Though never implemented, the two proposals illustrate what we all know: No one enjoys filling out tax forms. So why do we have to? A costly and time-consuming system Return-free filing is not difficult. At least 30 countries permit return-free filing, including Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, 95% of American taxpayers receive more than 30 types of information returns that let the government know their exact income. These information returns give the government everything it needs in order to fill out most taxpayers’ returns. The U.S. system is 10 times more expensive than tax systems in 36 other countries with robust economies. But those costs vanish in a return-free system, as would the 2.6 billion hours Americans spend on tax preparation each year. Maybe you’re wondering whether Congress is just behind the times, unaware that it can release us from tax preparation? Not true. As an expert on the U.S. tax system, I see America’s costly and time-consuming tax reporting system as a consequence of its relationship with the commercial tax preparation industry, which lobbies Congress to maintain the status quo. The United Kingdom is among dozens of countries that permit return-free filing for some taxpayers. Loop Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Commercial tax preparation Almost 20 years ago, Congress directed the IRS to provide low-income taxpayers with free tax preparation. The agency responded in 2002 with “Free File,” a public-private partnership between the government and the tax preparation industry. As part of the deal, the IRS agreed to not compete with the private sector in the free tax preparation market. In 2007, the House of Representatives rejected legislation to provide free, government tax preparation. And in 2019, Congress tried to legally bar the IRS from ever providing free online tax preparation services. Only a public outcry turned the tide. The public part of Free File consists of the IRS herding taxpayers to commercial tax preparation websites. The private part consists of those commercial entities diverting taxpayers toward costly alternatives. According to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which oversees IRS activities, private partners use computer code to hide the free websites and take unsuspecting taxpayers to paid sites. Should a taxpayer discover a free preparation alternative, the private preparers impose various restrictions such as income or the use of various forms as an excuse to kick taxpayers back to paid preparation. Consequently, of the more than 100 million taxpayers eligible for free help, 35% end up paying for tax preparation and 60% never even visit the free websites. Instead of 70% of Americans receiving free tax preparation, commercial companies whittle that percentage down to 3%. Tax savings and evasion Perhaps you are guessing that there are valid policy justifications for avoiding government and empowering the private sector. Judge those arguments yourself. One argument from commercial tax preparers is that taxpayers will miss out on valuable tax savings if they rely on free government preparation. In fact, the government software would reflect the same laws used by the paid preparers with the same access to tax saving deductions or credits. Further, tax preparers like H & R Block promise to pay all taxes and interest resulting from a failed audit. As a result, these services have every incentive to take conservative, pro-government tax positions. A second argument is that government-prepared tax returns encourage tax evasion. In a no-return system, the government reveals its knowledge of the taxpayer’s income before the taxpayer files. Thus, the argument goes, the taxpayer knows if the government has missed something and has reason to let the mistake stand. But taxpayers already know what information forms the government has because they receive duplicates of those forms. The incentive to lie does not increase because the taxpayer avoids weeks of tax preparation. [You’re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation’s authors and editors. You can get our highlights each weekend.] Bolstering the anti-taxers Finally, there is the anti-tax argument for onerous tax preparation: Keep tax preparation unpleasant to fuel anti-tax sentiment. In the past, Republicans argued against high taxes. But after decades of tax cuts, Americans are no longer swayed by that argument. Exasperating tax preparation, according to this argument, helps keep the anti-tax fever high. And that fuels public hate for government and the tax system. Unfortunately, the anti-tax contingent’s desire to force Americans to spend time and money on tax preparation dovetails with the tax preparation industry’s desire to collect billions of dollars in fees. Tax preparation companies lobby Congress to keep tax preparation costly and complicated. Indeed, Intuit, maker of TurboTax, the tax preparation software, lists government tax preparation as a threat to its business model. One example is the earned income tax credit, a government program for low-income people. The credit is so complicated that 20% of the people who are eligible never file. If the government prepared people’s tax returns, that 20% would receive government support. Nonetheless, Intuit has lobbied lawmakers to make the credit more complicated, thereby driving more taxpayers to paid preparation services. To date, the tax preparation industry has kept the system complicated because the potential cost to it in terms of lost revenue is vast. Only public outcry can change the system.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

The new round of stimulus checks will cost about $140 billion, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) told MSNBC, meaning the cost is roughly on par with the $160 billion in aid to state and local governments that had been proposed as part of a $908 billion compromise framework put forth by a bipartisan group of lawmakers.Republicans have pressed to keep the cost of any additional Covid aid below $1 trillion. Democrats said that that while the package leaves out funding for state and local governments, it would still deliver aid to states in other ways.Timing still in question: The progress comes after congressional leaders met in person Tuesday and continued their talks Wednesday as they race to finalize the coronavirus package and a $1.4 trillion federal spending bill before current government funding expires on Friday.“We made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief package that would be able to pass both chambers with bipartisan majorities,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday morning in a speech on the Senate floor. “We committed to continuing these urgent discussions until there’s an agreement. And we agreed we should not leave town until we’ve made law.”But negotiators were still haggling over various details of the plan. One reported sticking point is a Democratic push to increase the Federal Emergency Management Agency matching rate for Covid-19 disasters from 90% to 100%, according to Bloomberg News. Democrats say the change would cost $1 billion, but Republicans say it would cost $90 billion, based on the proposed legislative language, and object to what they see as an attempt to funnel more money to state and local governments.While the House could still vote on a deal as soon as Thursday, the timeline could slip, requiring a Senate vote over the weekend — and, potentially, another short-term extension of federal funding to avoid a partial government shutdown after midnight on Friday. "If we don’t get done by Friday night, I don’t want to shut down government," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said, according to Politico. "If we need three or four more days, we’ll take the time that’s necessary."The politics at play: Both sides have plenty of incentive to finalize a deal before they head home — and election politics are still part of the equation. McConnell reportedly told Republican senators on a call Wednesday that passing a relief deal will help GOP Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia as they head for January 5 runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. In campaigning for Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock on Tuesday, President-elect Joe Biden said he needs “two senators from this state who want to get something done, not two senators who are just going to get in the way.”More signs the economy needs help: U.S. retail sales fell 1.1% in November, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, marking the first drop since the spring. “Economists said the decline was a ‘warning sign’ that the economy was entering a rough patch and in need of a jolt from another round of government stimulus,” The New York Times reports.Nearly 8 million Americans have fallen into poverty since June, according to data released Wednesday by researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame, driving the poverty rate up 2.4 percentage points to 11.7%. And newly released Census Bureau survey data from late November and early December show that 85.4 million American adults, or 35.6%, report having trouble paying for basics such as food, medicine and rent, up from 76.5 million, or 31.9%, in early September.What it all means: A deal now appears all but certain. The price tag being discussed amounts to nearly double what Republicans had proposed but far less that the $2 trillion or more that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had sought for months. Still, while the cost of the package has come down, it would still be the second largest emergency spending package in U.S. history, behind only the CARES Act passed in March. And lawmakers are expected to renew their debates on state and aid a liability shield in the new year.Biden reiterated Wednesday that more aid will be needed. “The stimulus package is encouraging. Looks like they’re very, very close and it looks like there are going to be direct cash payments,” he told reporters. “But it’s a down payment, an important down payment on what’s going to have to be done at the end of January, the beginning of February.”Like what you\'re reading?

So when her health department announced it was expanding appointments, she armed herself with two phones — cellphone in one hand, landline in the other — and held her breath. Within 20 minutes, she secured a slot for the next day. She arrived for her 2 p.m. appointment and was resting in a chair, a fresh shot in her arm, by 2:21 p.m. “It went wonderfully,” said Zain, 79, who, after a year spent mostly home alone, wore a sequined face mask that shimmered like confetti for her appointment at a Charleston clinic last week. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Since the nation began distributing vaccines more than a month ago, it has moved far more slowly than officials hoped and has been stymied by widespread logistical problems. But West Virginia has stood out for its success in getting people vaccinated. About 9% of all West Virginians have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, a larger segment than in every state but Alaska and double the rate of some. No state has given a larger share of its residents second doses, a crucial step to securing the best chance at immunity. While many states are struggling to hand out the shots that the federal government has provided to them, West Virginia has given out 83% of its doses, by far among the highest. The patchwork system of distribution in the country is in its early weeks, and experts say operations may change significantly as vaccinations gear up further, but many states have struggled to give even half of their allotted vaccines. California and Rhode Island have used just 45% of their shots. “West Virginia is about at the top of the charts,” said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We need to get more states to the point that they have the vaccination capacity of West Virginia.” As many states struggle with logistical and bureaucratic challenges, leaving vaccines unused, West Virginia offers a remarkable example of a state that has successfully given out almost all of its shots. Yet it provides perhaps the clearest picture of a more fundamental problem that looms ahead for the country: Even the most efficient state vaccine operations do not have enough shots for all who want them. “It’s not like it’s a cakewalk, but we have efficiency,” said Dr. Clay Marsh, the state coronavirus czar. He estimated that West Virginia has the capacity to handle 125,000 doses a week, but is getting just 23,600. At the current pace, officials said, it could take up to five months to finish vaccinating people 65 and older, let alone younger people in the general population. “We can push a lot more,” Marsh said. “We just don’t have anything to push.” The race to vaccinate millions of Americans comes as the country confronts worrying new variants of the virus. The stakes are particularly high in West Virginia, where residents are among the oldest and least healthy in the nation. Two in 10 West Virginians are 65 or older, and nearly half of adults have a higher risk of developing a serious case of COVID-19. “People are dying every day,” said Albert L. Wright Jr., CEO of WVU Medicine, the state’s largest health care provider, which opened a mega-clinic in Morgantown last week. “We just realized, the only way out of this is to vaccinate our way out.” While the rollout in West Virginia has not been without its frustrations for the many residents who are desperate to receive the vaccine, the state’s approach offers insight into what has worked. Early on, the state got a significant head start because it initially opted out of a federal program to vaccinate people in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. While other states chose the federal plan, which partnered with Walgreens and CVS to inoculate people in nursing homes around the country, officials decided the idea made little sense in West Virginia, where many communities are tucked into the hills, miles from the nearest big box store, and about half of pharmacies are independently owned. West Virginia created a network of pharmacies in the state, pairing them with about 200 long-term care facilities. As a result, West Virginia finished its first round of vaccinations at nursing homes last month, while many states were just getting started. By the end of this week, officials expect to have delivered a second round of shots to all nursing homes. A growing number of governors and state health officials have voiced frustration with the speed of the federal program, which has been slow in part because of the sheer number of long-term care facilities nationwide. Some states, like Maine, have also begun looking to local pharmacies as a resource. “Using your local partners and really having more control over where the vaccine is going, that’s what has been successful for West Virginia,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. The approach in some ways reflects the scrappy outlook that has become embedded in West Virginia, a state that is used to being labeled in broad strokes by outsiders. After years of coming in at the bottom of various national rankings — highest rate of cigarette smokers, largest share of adults with multiple chronic conditions, among the highest prevalence of diabetes and obesity — there is a sense of proud defiance around the state’s vaccine plan. “Our state motto is montani semper liberi — mountaineers are always free,” said Stephen New, a lawyer in Beckley, whose father, a former coal miner, is scheduled to get vaccinated at a local clinic this week. “There is a fierce sense of independence here that we don’t need to follow others.” Central to West Virginia’s strategy, too, is putting the National Guard at the helm of vaccine operations. “They are logistical experts,” said Jim Kranz, a vice president at the West Virginia Hospital Association, who described a military approach far different than typical government bureaucracies jammed up by memos and lengthy meetings. “The Guard just says, ‘I don’t need a written plan, this is what we’re doing.’ ” In recent weeks, other states have increasingly been turning to the National Guard for assistance. Inside a former drill hall on the National Guard’s gated campus in Charleston, a core state team of representatives from various agencies meets at a command center, working amid a labyrinth of computer screens, whiteboards and plexiglass dividers, in the shadow of an enormous American flag. Officials in West Virginia say the in-person command center, which runs counter to pandemic-era Zoom meetings and may come with health risks, has also helped quickly resolve problems. For instance, a recent brainstorming meeting led to a swift change: To avoid a mix-up between Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, officials changed the colors of cards showing that a resident had been vaccinated — red for Moderna, blue for Pfizer. “It’s a person at a table,” said Joe Peal, a retired colonel and the chief of staff for the vaccine task force. “We absolutely could not do it virtually.” Officials say they have also learned what not to do — including not promising shots that they don’t yet have. After a crowd of people in their 80s unexpectedly showed up outside the health department in Charleston one shivering winter night, officials there decided clinics could not be first-come, first-served. They required appointments, and to avoid later rescinding those appointments, as has happened in states like New York and Florida, appointments are not made until the county officials have that week’s allotment of vaccines on hand, sitting in their own freezer. Some of West Virginia’s success also may partly be explained by characteristics of the state. Its population, 1.8 million people, is tiny compared to states like Texas, which are handling far more vaccines. West Virginia is also among only a handful of states that do not allow philosophical exemptions for vaccines for school, according to the Immunization Action Coalition, suggesting a culture where acceptance of vaccines may be more prevalent. West Virginia’s rollout has by no means been without hiccups. And some of the problems have been similar to those in states with far worse records in distributing shots: Phone lines have been mobbed and many West Virginians have spent hours calling to get appointments without success. The health department in Kanawha County, which includes Charleston, was so overloaded with phone calls last week, its phone system crashed and its Facebook page was flooded with complaints. “I’ve called 250+ times but still unable to get through,” one person wrote. The distribution of vaccines — mainly to health care workers and older residents — also has been concentrated in urban centers, raising concerns about equal access in rural and more impoverished areas. Of the state’s 10 poorest counties, just one had a vaccine clinic in recent weeks, according to an analysis by the nonprofit newsroom Mountain State Spotlight. But the main problem, officials say, is not logistical but a matter of supply: They need more vaccine. Dr. Sherri Young, the health officer in Kanawha County, said one big reason phone lines are overrun is because the county cannot reliably schedule clinics weeks in advance. If there were more vaccine, she said, “people wouldn’t be as panicked.” Pfizer and Moderna have pledged to deliver a combined 200 million doses for use in the United States by the end of March, with an additional 200 million doses to be delivered by the end of July. A third vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, could put millions more doses on the market if approved. West Virginia had hoped to make the case that because it is moving through its vaccines, it deserved to get more, but so far states have been allocated doses based on population. Jim Doria, 69, a retired public health researcher, had gone months without seeing his grandchildren who live in Philadelphia and was eager to be among the first to get vaccinated after the state opened the system to people in his age group last week. He estimated that he called as many as 700 times. “I won the lottery,” he said, after getting off a waitlist. But for every person like Doria, countless others were left disappointed. Statewide, West Virginia has given shots to around 70,000 of its senior citizens, with more than 250,000 left to go.

In a letter co-signed by his counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Professor Chris Whitty told medics "the public will understand and thank us" for administering as many first doses as possible rather than giving people a second jab within the recommended three or four weeks. It came as GPs across the country vowed to defy the Government\'s new strategy, describing it as a "huge gamble". Doctors\' leaders said the decision to cancel appointments for elderly patients due to have their second Pfizer coronavirus vaccination next week was "grossly unfair", encouraging GPs to press ahead with the planned jabs in defiance of the strategy. In a letter to ministers, the Doctors\' Association said there was no evidence that delaying the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine would be effective, suggesting the move "undermined the vaccine programme as a whole". In a joint letter sent to medics, all four of the UK\'s chief medical officers said: "We recognise that the request to reschedule second appointments is operationally very difficult, especially at short notice, and will distress patients who were looking forward to being fully immunised. "Halving the number vaccinated over the next two to three months because of giving two vaccines in quick succession rather than with a delay of 12 weeks does not provide optimal public health impact. We have to follow public health principles and act at speed if we are to beat this pandemic, which is running rampant in our communities, and we believe the public will understand and thank us for this decisive action."

The results of the study by the Clalit Research Institute and experts from Harvard University and Boston Children’s Hospital were published and peer-reviewed in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, which included more than a million people of whom nearly 600,000 were vaccinated, also showed the vaccine to be effective against the British strain of the coronavirus. Why It Matters: The results are the first from a real-world study and showed the vaccine to be as efficient as in clinical trials, where the vaccine has shown a 95 percent efficacy rate. It also mirrors the results of earlier studies from Israel, which has one of the most efficient inoculation campaigns in the world.

Fearful of party stalwarts growing comfortable crossing him, the president has pushed to keep up the pressure and plot possible revenge scenarios against potential turncoats, according to three people who spoke to him as he unwound at Mar-a-Lago and elsewhere over the holiday weekend.“Why aren’t they just listening [to me]?” one of the sources recalled Trump asking during a diatribe against prominent GOPers who the president felt weren’t fighting for him on his current battle lines: from nullifying the 2020 election outcome, to torpedoing liability law for Big Tech, to sending out $2,000 checks for COVID-19 relief.The comments came during Trump’s Christmas getaway in Florida this past weekend and for those who heard them they were some of the clearest indications to date that the president has reached an inflection point. Outwardly insistent that he was robbed of a re-election victory, he has privately groused that too many in his party are acknowledging the reality of his actual loss and showing signs of tiptoeing away from him.At other points during the long Christmas weekend, the president continued bemoaning the perceived lack of fealty from various elected Republicans, the sources recounted. He rattled off names such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (for being, in Trump’s estimation, a “wise guy”), and even his own VP, Mike Pence.“He is keeping a running [mental] list of Republicans who he believes have wronged him since the election,” a source close to Trump said. “The president certainly wants it out there that he’s capable of holding a grudge, and that he has campaigned against [some] Republicans before and could do it again.”Trump Grows Increasingly Angry With FDA, Wonders if COVID Vaccine Makers Are ‘Democrats’Trump’s musings evoke a president at once eager to portray himself as mighty and tacitly fearful that his aura of political power may be breaking.The president keeps insisting to his supporters that he could somehow still cling to that power—with President-elect Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington, D.C., fast approaching—through increasingly anti-democratic efforts to nullify the election results. But privately, the president has begun losing faith in the work of even some of his most diehard surrogates and allied attorneys. Last week, Trump had informed the conspiracy theory-spouting lawyer (and former member of his legal team) Sidney Powell that he did not intend to appoint her “special counsel” to investigate election “fraud,” as the two of them had once discussed. And in recent days, he’s acknowledged to some confidants, with apparent disappointment, that Powell keeps “striking out” in court and overpromising but underdelivering in her crusade of wild allegations of a massive conspiracy, two people familiar with his admissions said.As Trump and many of his MAGA devotees look to the Jan. 6 session in Congress for certifying the Electoral College vote as a potential last stand, the outgoing president’s already limited attention to the responsibilities of the office he holds has dwindled even further. Limited resources and attention are now being paid to even his primary objectives.After weeks of trumpeting his administration’s coronavirus vaccine rollout as one of the crowning jewels of his time in office, Trump has tried this week to shovel as much guilt as possible onto the states for the slower-than-projected rollout. He has pushed publicly for Congress to pass $2,000 checks to Americans for COVID relief. But he’s done little to work Republicans on Capitol Hill to support the measure, save the occasional Twitter excoriation for potentially bucking him. Although his White House has gone to great lengths to pretend as if it is readying for a second term, members of his staff have quietly begun leaving.Derek Kan, formerly a senior official at Trump’s Transportation Department and White House budget office, became one the latest to do so when he filed ethics exit paperwork this week noting that he’d left the administration on Dec. 5. A source familiar with his post-administration plans told The Daily Beast that Kan will be advising the investment firm Oaktree Capital. The ethics paperwork also indicates he’s lined up a gig with Deliverr, a San Francisco-based eCommerce fulfillment startup.“Actions speak louder than words, and from what we’re seeing of staff leaving the White House and preparations others are making to leave, it’s sinking in what will happen on Jan. 20,” said Steven Groves, who served as a lawyer, and then spokesman, in the Trump White House. “Even though it appears President Trump knows this, he still knows how to command the press’ attention. But to me, as a conservative, any energy spent by the Republican Party at this time that is not directed at the Senate races in Georgia is misdirected.”Trump Tweets Conspiracy About Georgia Secretary of State’s ‘Brother’ Who ‘Works for China’Individuals close to Trump and several of his senior aides say that in recent weeks, the president has struggled behind closed doors to hide his feelings of loss, frustration, and disappointment. Often, he has reverted to his old habits of sheltering himself from voices of mild dissent in his own ranks, ones who would tell him to let it go with even a modicum of grace.Trump is determined to keep up appearances, attending various social functions and parties, where he is feted by the Trump faithful. And many of his friends insist that he is, whatever the contradictory evidence may be, not mad or losing heart.On Sunday evening, Trump took a brief moment during a buffet feast at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach to reunite with his former political adviser Roger Stone, whom he had just pardoned the week prior. Stone said he was at the club that night as a guest of Christopher Ruddy, the Newsmax CEO and another Trump pal.When asked about what Stone and the president discussed, Ruddy told The Daily Beast, “I don’t comment on any of the private dinners,” adding that the “president has seemed upbeat about things lately.”In the midst of his building despondency, Trump is seizing on little, unexpected joys where he can find and get them. This week, Gallup announced that its public polling shows that Trump now ranks as the “Most Admired” man in the United States, ending his predecessor Barack Obama’s 12-year stretch as the most admired man. According to Gallup, that would make Obama “tied with Dwight Eisenhower for the most ever.”The “Most Admired” man and woman surveys that Gallup conducts annually lean heavily on name recognition and national fame, and it is incredibly common that the sitting president, no matter who it is, emerges as a winner. Given that metric, it actually took Trump an unusually long time to topple Obama from the top spot, as the former Democratic president bested Trump for most of the years of the latter’s term.To some presidents, that might come off as embarrassing. But not to Trump. According to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, soon after the president was informed of how he, in Trump’s own words, “beat Obama” this year, Trump specifically instructed aides to publicly promote it far and wide.—With additional reporting by Lloyd GroveRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Andriy Onufriyenko/Moment via Getty ImagesTens of millions of people across the U.S. have received a coronavirus vaccine. So far, the majority of doses have been either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, both of which use mRNA to generate an immune response. These gene-based vaccines have been in the works for decades, but this is the first time they have been used widely in people. MRNA vaccines are proving to be more effective than anyone had hoped, but as with any new medical advancement, people have a lot of questions. How do they work? Are they safe? Do I really need two shots? Why do they need to be kept so cold? And will this be the vaccine technology of the future? Below, we highlight five articles from The Conversation that will help answer your questions about mRNA vaccines. 1. A vaccine revolution “DNA and mRNA vaccines offer huge advantages over traditional types of vaccines, since they use only genetic code from a pathogen – rather than the entire virus or bacteria,” writes Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist at the University of Washington who has been working on gene-based vaccines for decades. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are proof that mRNA vaccines are ready for prime time – and far surpass their predecessors. “The hopes that gene-based vaccines could one day provide a vaccine for malaria or HIV, cure cancer, replace less effective traditional vaccines or be ready to stop the next pandemic before it gets started are no longer far-fetched,” explains Fuller. 2. How does an mRNA vaccine work? These vaccines are not only effective, they work in a fundamentally different way from traditional vaccines, explains Sanjay Mishra, a staff scientist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Traditional vaccines use an entire dead virus – or just a piece of one – to generate immunity. “But an mRNA vaccine is different,” writes Mishra, “because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material – mRNA – that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body.” Just as the pandemic hit, mRNA vaccine research had reached a tipping point. CDC/Alissa Eckert, MSMI; Dan Higgins, MAMS 3. Quick to market, but still safe “Safety is the first and foremost goal for a vaccine,” says William Petri, a Professor of Medicine at the University of Virginia. A lot of people have expressed safety concerns based on how fast these vaccines were developed, approved and distributed. According to Petri, the vaccines still went through every normal step – they just did them simultaneously. “In my opinion, safety is not compromised by the speed of vaccine development and emergency use authorization. The reason that vaccines may be approved so quickly is that the large clinical trials to assess vaccine efficacy and safety are happening at the same time as the large-scale manufacturing preparation, funded by the federal government’s Operation Warp Speed program.” 4. Why it’s important to get your second shot You got your first vaccine shot. But with shortages and supply problems, getting the second dose might be becoming a hassle. Does it really matter? Yes, explains William Petri in another article. “The first dose primes the immune system and introduces the body to the germ of interest. This allows the immune system to prepare its defense. The second dose, or booster, provides the opportunity for the immune system to ramp up the quality and quantity of the antibodies used to fight the virus.” Immunity is a complex process, and “if the booster isn’t given within the appropriate window, lower quantities of antibodies will be produced that may not provide as powerful protection from the virus,” writes Petri. So go get your second shot if you can, even if you have to get it a bit later than expected. Both doses are important for full immunity. AP Photo/Paul Sancya 5. Subzero storage makes distribution a challenge For all of their amazing attributes, mRNA vaccines do have at least one weakness: “If they get too warm or too cold they spoil. And, just like fish, a spoiled vaccine must be thrown away,” explains Anna Nagurney, Professor of Operations Management at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studies medical supply chains. The mRNA molecule is very fragile, so vaccines need to be kept at extremely cold, very specific temperatures – a challenge for distribution. “The answer is something called the vaccine cold chain – a supply chain that can keep vaccines in tightly controlled temperatures from the moment they are made to the moment that they are administered to a person,” explains Nagurney. This cold supply chain is critical to getting vaccines where they need to go, and without it, no matter how good the vaccines are, they can’t make much of a difference.

{'_id': '9b242761e2fbb323ab12280e9c951535', 'title': 'In Oregon, Scientists Find a Virus Variant With a Worrying Mutation', 'description': "Scientists in Oregon have spotted a homegrown version of a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that first surfaced in Britain — but now it's combined with a mutation that may make the variant less susceptible to vaccines. The researchers have so far found just a single case of this formidable combination, but genetic analysis suggested that the variant had been acquired in the community and did not arise in the patient. “We didn’t import this from elsewhere in the world — it occurred spontaneously,” said Brian O’Roak, a geneticist at Oregon Health and Science University who led the work. He and his colleagues participate in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s effort to track variants, and they have deposited their results in databases shared by scientists. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The variant originally identified in Britain, called B.1.1.7, has been spreading rapidly across the United States, and accounts for at least 2,500 cases in 46 states. This form of the virus is both more contagious and more deadly than the original version, and it is expected to account for most U.S. infections in a few weeks. The new version that surfaced in Oregon has the same backbone, but also a mutation — E484K, or “Eek” — seen in variants of the virus circulating in South Africa, Brazil and New York City. Lab studies and clinical trials in South Africa indicate that the Eek mutation renders the current vaccines less effective by blunting the body’s immune response. (The vaccines still work, but the findings are worrying enough that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have begun testing new versions of their vaccines designed to defeat the variant found in South Africa.) The B.1.1.7 variant with Eek also has emerged in Britain, designated as a “variant of concern” by scientists. But the virus identified in Oregon seems to have evolved independently, O’Roak said. O’Roak and his colleagues found the variant among coronavirus samples collected by the Oregon State Public Health Lab across the state, including some from an outbreak in a health care setting. Of the 13 test results they analyzed, 10 turned out to be B.1.1.7 alone, and one the combination. Other experts said the discovery was not surprising, because the Eek mutation has arisen in forms of the virus all over the world. But the mutation’s occurrence in B.1.1.7 is worth watching, they said. In Britain, this version of the variant accounts for a small number of cases. But by the time the combination evolved there, B.1.1.7 had already spread through the country. “We’re at the point where B.1.1.7 is just being introduced” into the United States, said Stacia Wyman, an expert in computational genomics at the University of California, Berkeley. “As it evolves, and as it slowly becomes the dominant thing, it could accumulate more mutations.” Viral mutations may enhance or weaken one another. For example, the variants identified in South Africa and Brazil contain many of the same mutations, including Eek. But the Brazilian version has a mutation, K417N, that is not present in the version from South Africa. In a study published Thursday in Nature, researchers compared antibody responses to all three variants of concern — the ones identified in Britain, South Africa and Brazil. Consistent with other studies, they found that the variant that pummeled South Africa is most resistant to antibodies produced by the immune system. But the variant circulating in Brazil was not as resistant, even though it carried the Eek mutation. “If you have the second mutation, you don’t see as bad an effect,” said Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis, who led the study. It’s too early to say whether the variant in Oregon will behave like the ones in South Africa or Brazil. But the idea that other mutations could weaken Eek’s effect is “excellent news,” Wyman said. Overall, she said, the Oregon finding reinforces the need for people to continue to take precautions, including wearing a mask, until a substantial portion of the population is immunized. “People need to not freak out but to continue to be vigilant,” she said. “We can’t let down our guard yet while there’s still these more transmissible variants circulating.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company", 'num_of_covid': 3}

Figures publihsed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) today show that overall goods exports from the UK fell by £5.3 billion - 19.3 per cent. That was driven by a £5.6 billion, or 40.7 per cent, plunge in exports of goods to the EU. But while Brexit played a factor, Lord Frost insisted that stockpiling and lockdown were also behind the drop in cross-border trade. The newly-promoted Cabinet Office minister said that January\'s "unique combination of factors made it inevitable that we would see some unusual figures", but insisted that "caution should be applied". He added: "These effects are starting to unwind.

TRUMP: &quot;Ideally, we won&#39;t go to a lockdown. I will not go. This administration will not be going to a lockdown. Hopefully, the... the, uh, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration will be? I guess time will tell. But I can tell you, this administration will not go to a lockdown.&quot;               Trump made the comments at an Operation Warp Speed news conference, during which he said he expects a coronavirus vaccine to be available to the general population as soon as April. He left the podium without taking questions despite loud clamoring from reporters.               Friday&#39;s briefing came just hours after Edison Research projected that Biden won the state of Georgia, while Trump won North Carolina. Those two states were the last to be called in the U.S. presidential race, lifting Biden&#39;s Electoral College vote total to 306 - the same number Trump reached in 2016, which he called a landslide victory.               Biden&#39;s team has been pressing ahead with a transition despite the Trump administration&#39;s refusal to provide intelligence briefings, access to federal office space and other resources.               In an exclusive interview with Politico, Trump&#39;s former Chief of Staff John Kelly said Trump doesn&#39;t have to concede but said the wait over Biden receiving intelligence briefings &quot;hurts our national security.&quot;               Meanwhile, Trump is forging ahead with a long-shot litigation effort to try to overturn the results of the presidential election.               In the most recent blow to that strategy, a Michigan state court on Friday rejected a request by Trump supporters to block the certification of votes in Detroit, which went heavily in favor of Biden.                In another setback on Friday, the Trump campaign dropped a lawsuit in Arizona seeking an audit of all ballots, after it was clear the margin of victory could not be overcome. Biden was projected as the winner in Arizona late Thursday night, according to Edison Research.               Biden&#39;s legal advisers have dismissed the Trump lawsuits as political theater and legal experts say they&#39;re very unlikely to change the outcome of the election and are likely mostly about fundraising.               In recent days, Trump&#39;s supporters have been bombarded with fundraising emails asking for money to help pay for what the campaign says are legal challenges to the election results. But a Reuters review of the legal language in the solicitations found that any small-dollar donations won&#39;t be going to legal expenses at all. And the fine print makes clear that most of the money will go to other priorities.               Trump&#39;s campaign has been working on retiring its debt and contributions to his legal fund can also be used for that purpose.', 'num_of_covid': 6}

In a serious blow less than a week ahead of key regional elections, the MPs were accused of accepting backhand payments to broker government contracts for facemasks. Nikolas Löbel resigned as an MP and as a member of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrat party (CDU) on Monday after admitting he accepted a commission of €250,000 (£215,000) for arranging a local government contract. “To be a member of the German Bundestag and represent my hometown Mannheim there is a great honor and a special moral obligation,” Mr Löbel said in a statement. “I violated this obligation with my actions. I would like to apologise to all the citizens of the country.” A second MP, Georg Nüsslein, denies allegations he accepted backhanders of more than €600,000 (£515,000) to broker facemask contracts for the Bavarian regional government. Mr Nüsslein resigned from Mrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), on Monday but has so far resisted calls to give up his seat in parliament. The scandal comes with Mrs Merkel’s government already facing public anger over Germany's slow and chaotic vaccine roll-out. The allegations have hit the CDU hard in the run-up to elections in two states that are expected to serve as a bellwether for September’s general election. In polling in Baden-Württemberg, traditionally a CDU stronghold, the party is 11 points behind the rival Greens, while in Rhineland-Palatinate it is 4 points behind the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD). Party grandees reacted furiously to the allegations. Mr Löbel initially tried to cling on in parliament but resigned after Armin Laschet, the CDU leader, called on him to go. “Such behaviour is indecent and we are ashamed,” Paul Ziemiak, the CDU secretary-general, said. “If you've held up your hand to something like that, you've got to resign.” Markus Söder, the CSU leader, called on Mr Nusslein to stand down as an MP but admitted the party could not force him to resign his seat. “It is intolerable when representatives of the people try to turn a crisis into a business opportunity,” Mr Söder said.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

The source did not provide the exact efficacy of the vaccine against the Brazilian variant, but said the full results of the study should be released soon, possibly in March.The promising information comes as a small-sample study suggested that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac may not work effectively against the Brazilian variant.Brazil is currently confronting a brutal and long-lasting second wave of the coronavirus, hitting a daily record of more than 1900 deaths on Wednesday.The P1 variant is among the factors that epidemiologists believe is contributing to a rise in cases and deaths there, with concern in the scientific community about the variant's resistance to vaccines.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

Associated PressThe new year has brought the deadliest weeks of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic thus far, with thousands of deaths every day. It’s been several weeks since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first of two emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, but getting one isn’t easy. There are no available appointments to get a vaccine in many communities. Wait times at California’s Dodger Stadium, the nation’s largest distribution site, reached five hours earlier this month. At the current rate, it could take until 2022 for all adult Americans to be vaccinated, according to some estimates. The Biden administration is trying to change that. The national strategy President Biden rolled out in his first week in office includes a target of injecting 100 million vaccines during his first 100 days as president and strengthening distribution to high-risk communities. A key component of the president’s five-step vaccine plan, he said, is to “fully activate the pharmacies across the country.” This will greatly expand the number of providers to administer vaccines – and expand the role of pharmacists in the pandemic in the weeks and months ahead. As pharmacists who work in both rural and urban settings, we are among those who are preparing to meet this challenge. Challenges with handling and distribution With the slow rollout, community pharmacies are being brought on board much sooner than anticipated. They’ve been an underutilized resource: U.S. pharmacies have experience storing and administering many types of vaccines. In 2018, they gave about one-third of all flu shots, up from 18% in 2012. They are now preparing to handle the new Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have a new, but not unknown, mechanism. The Moderna vaccine can be kept in a traditional freezer, but the Pfizer vaccine requires ultra-cold storage at -112 to -76 F before being thawed and administered. Health systems and federal partner pharmacies equipped with these specialized freezers are key hubs for distribution. It’s not just the vaccine that needs to be protected. Pharmacies are stockpiling personal protective equipment to keep staff safe. They have also established safety protocols for patients – social distancing, disinfection and observation for 15 to 30 minutes after vaccination. There are also administrative requirements, issuing immunization cards to those who have been immunized and reporting the number of administered doses to state and federal officials. Pharmacies are registering with the searchable Vaccine Finder website – where people will be able to search for participating pharmacies. The vaccine is free: Insurance companies will be billed an administration fee, though a national relief fund covers that cost for the uninsured. Under a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate, pharmacists and pharmacist interns who have completed a minimum of 20 hours of accredited training are authorized to administer COVID-19 vaccines. The U.S. is amidst the deadliest wave of the pandemic. COVID Tracking Project Sharing information While health departments and local officials are working to share information, many people are calling their local pharmacies with questions. Because the vaccine was produced, tested and approved in record time, some are questioning its safety. It was produced quickly because government funding fast-tracked various phases of development, allowing them to be conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially. Thousands of volunteers signed up for clinical trials, speeding the process, and emergency FDA approval allowed for rollout while some phase 3 studies are completed. People are also concerned about contracting coronavirus from the vaccine, which is impossible. Neither mRNA vaccine contains live virus; they simply teach the body to recognize the unique spike protein on the outside of the COVID-19 virus to create a faster immune response to the invader if exposed. Two doses must be spaced 21 to 28 days apart, and it takes another few weeks after the second dose to reach full immunity. Pharmacists can administer vaccinations and also answer questions about vaccines. C.C. Chapman/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND Some who have called us are worried about possible side effects. The most commonly reported aftereffect is pain and swelling at the injection site; some individuals have also reported chills, fever, headache or fatigue. While this may be uncomfortable, it’s not alarming: These are all signs that the immune system is doing its job. We have also helped explain to people why all are monitored after their shot. A few people have had serious allergic reactions – anaphylactic shock, which is why there is an established observation period after the vaccine that is longer for anyone with a history of allergies. Pharmacists are trained to respond to these rare reactions should they occur. There have also been reports of individuals who have died within days or weeks of receiving the vaccine. Researchers are investigating these rare events, but so far, there is no evidence that the vaccine is responsible. Unrelated or “incidental” illness seems to be the culprit, which is unsurprising given the demographics – many of those vaccinated in the early rollout are elderly people who are in frail health. Vaccines have the power to bring this pandemic under control. They could possibly even end it, but only after some 70% of humanity is inoculated. Almost 90% of Americans live within five miles of a local pharmacy where, starting in February, many will be able to get vaccinated against this virus.

The size of the check drops for those who earned between $75,000 and $99,000, and goes away completely for those who made more than $99,000.The legislature extends unemployment benefits of up to $300 per week and a program for contract and gig workers. It also includes more than $284 billion to cover first and second forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans and expands PPP eligibility to news organizations and nonprofits. Independent movie theaters and cultural institutions will also receive $15 billion and a tax break for corporate meal expenses pushed by the White House was approved, despite objections from Democrats.The package extends the moratorium on evictions until Jan. 31 and provides $25 billion in emergency assistance to renters, but the Post notes it\'s unclear at this time how the funding will be distributed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the bill sets aside billions of dollars "specifically for combating the disparities facing communities of color, and to support our heroic health-care workers and providers."The agreement also includes $13 billion in increased food stamps and nutrition benefits, $16 billion for airline employee and contractor payroll support, $20 billion to purchase vaccines, and $82 billion for schools to replace and repair heating and air conditioning units in order to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. It does not call for any new money for state and local governments or hazard pay for essential workers.

The short answer to both questions is yes – the details are below – though any discomfort pales in comparison with contracting Covid-19. We used clinical trial data gathered by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to explore the kinds of side-effects most commonly associated with the three vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the US. Those vaccines were developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (Niaid) and most recently by Johnson & Johnson. What are the common side-effects? The Covid vaccine is injected deep into your body tissue, which can leave you feeling sore. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA For all the vaccines, the most common side-effects include: Soreness where the vaccine is injected. Fatigue. Headache and muscle soreness. Less common side-effects can also include nausea, chills and fever. The vast majority of symptoms cause discomfort, but not a total disruption of your daily habits. Are Covid-19 vaccines safe? Yes. Their safety is tested in large trials of tens of thousands of people, then the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to monitor vaccine safety data, including side-effects, after the vaccines are authorized. These are sometimes referred to as phase IV trials. That monitoring goes hand-in-hand with reporting through several vaccine safety registries. These ongoing studies can help identify the rarest of side-effects, and pinpoint people who may have special sensitivities to the vaccine, such as a potential for an allergic reaction. One of the key numbers included in the graphs below is the rate of people who experienced side-effects after receiving a “placebo”, or an injection of saline instead of the vaccine. People involved in the trials did not know whether or not they received the vaccine. This helps researchers understand the background rate of these side-effects in the population. Moderna vaccine side-effects Formally called mRNA-1273, this vaccine was developed by Moderna in partnership with the Niaid, but most people simply know it as the Moderna vaccine, which is a two-dose regimen spaced 28 days apart. A clinical trial involving more than 30,000 participants across 99 sites in the US found the vaccine was safe and effective, and protected people against Covid 94.1% of the time. Among those trial participants, 15,168 people received the vaccine and the rest received a placebo. Moderna dose 1 side-effects We used results from the vaccine’s trials to describe how likely it is for people aged 18 to 64 to experience a given side-effect within one week of a dose of the vaccine. On average, these symptoms cleared up within three days, and often less. default Moderna dose 2 side-effects A key feature of the two-dose regimen is that people are more likely to experience side-effects after the second dose. default Pfizer vaccine side-effects A vaccine developed by Pfizer with the pharmaceutical name BNT162B2 uses mRNA technology, much like Moderna’s vaccine. Their trial used 152 sites around the world. While the majority (130) were in the US, trial sites were also located in Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. More than 43,000 people were involved in the trial. The vaccine was found to be 95% effective at preventing Covid-19. Pfizer’s vaccine uses a two-dose regiment spaced 21 days apart. Pfizer dose one side-effects Unlike Moderna, Pfizer studied side-effects in two separate age groups: people between aged 16 and 55, and people older than 55. Because people older than 55 are slightly less likely to experience side-effects, the younger group is presented here. default Pfizer dose two side-effects Like the Moderna vaccine, some side-effects were more common after the second dose. default Johnson & Johnson side-effects The most recent vaccine authorized in the US is from the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen. Johnson & Johnson’s trial included more than 40,000 people across 19 geographic regions. Importantly, this included South Africa, where the vaccine was found to be slightly less effective against the B1351 variant. The FDA found this vaccine is more than 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19. While this efficacy rate is lower than the two previously discussed vaccines, it still gives near perfect protection against hospitalization and death, and provides advantages in fighting the pandemic. Johnson & Johnson side-effects The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose, has a generally lower rate of side-effects. default What causes the side-effects? Side-effects are a sign the vaccine is prompting your body to mount an immune response. They may be uncomfortable, but can also be a sign the vaccine is working as intended. Side-effects are caused by the release of chemicals in the body which signal to the immune system it is time to mount a response. These naturally occurring chemicals are called cytokines and chemokines. Though there is not a one-to-one correlation between side-effects and an immune response, side-effects are an expected part of the process. “What we look for as vaccinologists is the Goldilocks response,” said Dr Greg Poland, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Vaccine and head of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic. Poland also consults for major vaccine manufacturers. “We don’t want too little” immune response, “we don’t want too much, we want just enough,” said Poland. The balance Poland is describing is sometimes referred to as between “immunogenicity” and “reactogenicity”, or the propensity to prompt an immune response versus the tolerability of side-effects. Why should I trust this data? In vaccine science, these often mild side-effects are described as “adverse events”. In Covid-19 vaccine studies, researchers collected information on everything from hip fractures to heart attacks to monitor the safety of these vaccines. “We have a very, very robust system in the US,” to track adverse vaccine events, said Poland. “It’s how we were able to pinpoint a risk of anaphylaxis in specific kinds of people occurring at the rate of 2.4-4.5 per million, something you could never have done in this kind of timely manner in the past.” Importantly, the vast majority these side-effects are not related to vaccines, but are nevertheless documented to ensure there is not a pattern, and to verify the safety of one of the only medical interventions given to healthy people. The FDA then produces its own analysis of vaccine trials, and the data is presented to an independent panel of experts, who review it and make a recommendation on whether to authorize the vaccines based on the results. The FDA analyses presented to the committee are public, and can be viewed here, as can meetings of this expert panel.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '67169343662297d2facd95071e0f8bd7', 'title': 'Why scientists think this year will be the ‘summer of STIs’', 'description': 'After 12 months of dreary restrictions, it is little wonder that many of us could be cautiously looking forward to a 1960s-style ‘summer of love’ with outdoor parties, live music… and lots of sex. But one of the unfortunate side effects of post-lockdown hedonism is a greater chance of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Experts are particularly worried that a more potent strain of gonorrhoea will take hold this summer. According to the Sexual Health Hub, it is already the second most common STI in the UK, after chlamydia. Although it is most common among the 20-24 age group, with a rate of 269.5 per 100,000 of the population, it can strike at any time in life. And according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the antibiotic azithromycin – which is commonly used to treat chest and sinus infections and has been used over the past year to prevent “confection of hospitalised patients” – has built up a resistance to the bacteria that causes gonorrhoea. The WHO warns that this “super gonorrhoea” could be untreatable, as the use of antibiotics during the pandemic continues to fuel its mutation. Claudia Estcourt from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), says that although the organisation hasn’t seen azithromycin causing cases of super gonorrhoea yet, she acknowledges that antimicrobial resistance has been “a concern within STI medicine” for many years, “particularly for the bacteria which cause gonorrhoea and for Mycoplasma genitalium (M gen).” She adds that because of reduced numbers of people coming for STI testing in lockdown, the figures for 2020 will show that reported infections have fallen, but they are predicted to rise again in 2021. “This is largely due to the fact we have been unable to test as much as we would have liked, as well as people’s changed (reduced) sexual behaviour. As we get back to normal, we will probably return to what we were seeing in 2019 with rises in chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis in some groups,” she says. Indeed, this crisis was brewing long before the pandemic. Data from the State of the Nation report from the Terrence Higgins Trust and BASHH revealed that in February last year, cases of gonorrhoea had risen by 249 per cent in the last decade, with cases of syphilis also up 165 per cent. In the past year, experts say the number of people visiting sexual health clinics dropped by 85 per cent, meaning many STI cases could be going undiagnosed. Since last year, single people have had significant limitations on their sexual freedom. Early on in March 2020, the Government imposed strict rules that couples who didn’t live together, and singletons, couldn’t visit each other’s houses for sex. This was later echoed by the deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries, who said that couples living separately should either stay apart or “test the strength of their relationship” and move in together. In September, the rules eased slightly to allow people in ‘established relationships’ to meet up for sex. But even now that restriction was lifted, caution is still advised for singletons. “We know from surveys that over the last year the number of people having sex with new sexual partners has greatly reduced compared to what we would expect in normal times. I’m sure many people will be keen to resume dating and sex with new partners once restrictions ease, whether or not they have been vaccinated,” says Estcourt. This increased sense of sexual freedom might be heightened by the development of the vaccine, or people believing they have immunity because they have already contracted the virus. But while your chances of catching coronavirus will (hopefully) diminish as time goes on, your chances of catching an STI won’t. So how can we stay safe? Condoms are the answer: they are 98 per cent effective at protecting against most STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhoea. “It is really important to think about protecting yourself from STIs including HIV, as well as Covid, and to remember that using condoms will greatly reduce your risk of sexually transmitted infection,” says Estcourt. “Always get yourself checked if you develop any symptoms which may suggest an STI, such as genital or anal discharge, rash or spots, and contact your local sexual health service for advice on how to get a check-up.” STI testing is available during lockdown but as with many medical services in the pandemic, the format has slightly changed. Many services are offering a phone call or online consultation first, to discuss symptoms and appropriate options before arranging an in-person clinic visit if needed. Alternatively, you can order postal STI tests that check for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, although companies are warning that they may be late arriving due to delays with the postal service.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': '8a6731b495920f81baf0303acf74cd11', 'title': 'What You Need to Know About Your Vaccine Card', 'description': 'As vaccinations become more widely available for people in the United States and travel starts picking up, many people have started sharing their simple white vaccination cards on social media as prized new possessions. With some destinations, cruise lines and venues already requiring travelers to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19, keeping that record is key. In New York, for example, proof of vaccination or a recent negative test will be required for entry into large venues or catered events when they are allowed to reopen at reduced capacity Friday. Proof will be required at events with more than 100 people, so anyone having a wedding or Sweet 16 with more attendees will have to ask guests for evidence that they are complying with the rules. There are already a number of vaccination “passport” initiatives underway that would make vaccination status easy to share digitally. Clear, a biometric screening program used in airports across the country, and the technology company IBM have created their own passes, for instance. And last week, New York became the first state to introduce a digital tool to allow people to easily show that they have either tested negative or been inoculated against the virus in order to gain entry to some events and venues. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times But until such measures are taken more widely across the country, you’ll want to hang onto that little white card. Here’s everything you need to know about your vaccine record, why it’s important and how to keep it safe. What’s on your vaccine card? The vaccine card, given after your first shot and then updated if your vaccine requires a second one, includes the vaccine manufacturer, the dose numbers and the date and location each was administered, according to Alex Brown, a spokeswoman for Walgreens, which is administering vaccinations at more than 5,000 stores nationwide. Walgreens, like other providers, is looking to make its records digital, Brown said, but for now it is still handing out cards. Walmart and Sam’s Club are already offering their patrons digital access to their vaccine records through both the Health Pass by Clear and the CommonHealth and CommonPass apps from the Geneva-based nonprofit the Commons Project Foundation. “Our goal is to give customers vaccinated at Walmart free and secure digital access to their vaccine record and enable them to share that information with third parties seeking to confirm their vaccination status,” John Furner, the chief executive officer and president of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. What happens if I lose my card? Getting a new card is easy enough if you got vaccinated at a pharmacy like Walgreens. Brown said that people who lose their cards should return to where they were vaccinated and pharmacy employees can print out new cards from the patients’ electronic records. Vaccinations are also tracked by state health departments, so you can reach out to your state’s agency to get a replacement card, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency lists contact information for the Immunization Information System in each state, which tracks vaccinations, on its website. How should I safeguard my card? Start by taking a picture of it with your phone, so you’ll have the information in your photo library, and emailing it to yourself as backup, said Dr. Uchenna Ikediobi, an assistant professor of general internal medicine and infectious diseases at Yale University. Laminating your card will make it more durable if you’re planning to carry it around in your wallet, although there has been some concern about lamination because it would prevent information from future booster shots from being added. But Ikediobi said that this “may be a moot point if new cards are issued after a booster shot, as would seem likely.” A number of companies have jumped in to offer free lamination. Staples is offering free lamination of vaccine cards for those who have gotten their doses, according to Jocelyn Moruzzi, a spokeswoman for the office goods retailer. The offer is valid at all of the company’s U.S. locations with the offer code 81450 and does not yet have an end date. “Customers began seeking out ways to protect their COVID-19 vaccine record cards, knowing they will likely be important to have on hand in the future,” Craig Grayson, vice president of print and marketing services for Staples, said in an email Wednesday. “Leveraging our existing capabilities in store felt like a natural way to provide a free solution.” People can also get their completed vaccine cards laminated for free at Office Depot and OfficeMax stores nationwide using the code 52516714 through July 25. Ikediobi also recommends keeping the card in a safe place, as you would your passport, rather than carrying it around. “It does not necessarily need to be on your person at all times,” she said. Do I need my card to travel? In some cases, yes. Some destinations and cruise lines have started requiring that travelers be fully vaccinated before they travel. As of March 26, fully vaccinated Americans who can present proof of vaccination can visit Iceland, for example, and avoid border measures such as testing and quarantining, the country’s government said. The cruise line Royal Caribbean is requiring passengers and crew members 18 or older to be vaccinated in order to board its ships, as are Virgin Voyages, Crystal Cruises and others. These companies will restart cruise operations this spring and summer. The companies are not yet operating cruises out of U.S. ports because the CDC has yet to give them the guidelines they’ll need to follow. For the moment, airlines are not requiring vaccinations for travel. But the idea has been much talked about in the industry. In an interview with NBC Nightly News recently, Ed Bastian, the chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines, said that proof of vaccination will likely eventually be required on international flights, but whether that is paper proof or a digital vaccine passport, is unclear. Will New York require a vaccine passport? Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week announced the launch of Excelsior Pass, a free app that will allow businesses to scan a code to confirm whether someone has been vaccinated or tested negative for the coronavirus. To sign up, New York residents should visit the Excelsior Pass website, where they will be asked to enter their name, date of birth and ZIP code. A pass — a QR code that can be scanned by businesses — will automatically be generated using data from state vaccination records or testing lab data. No one is required to download Excelsior Pass, according to a spokesman for the governor’s office. The pass generated on the website can be printed out, or you can show your vaccine card or evidence of a negative test result instead. Will the Biden administration require a vaccine passport? Among the Biden administration’s executive orders aimed at curbing the pandemic is one that asked government agencies to “assess the feasibility” of producing digital versions of vaccination documents. But while the government is involved in these efforts, the administration has said that it would not be passing a federal mandate or distributing its own vaccine passport. In a White House COVID-19 news conference Monday, Andy Slavitt, the acting director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that “unlike other parts of the world, the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of citizens.” “We view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do,” he said. “What’s important to us — and we’re leading an interagency process right now to go through these details — are that some important criteria be met with these credentials,” including equitable access and privacy and security concerns. Are there other benefits? Yes. Businesses across the country, from bars to marijuana dispensaries, have been offering perks to those with a COVID-19 vaccination card. Krispy Kreme, for instance, said last week that for the rest of the year, it would give one free glazed doughnut per day to anyone who presents proof of a COVID-19 vaccination. Michael Tattersfield, the company’s chief executive, told Fox News that as vaccinations have accelerated across the country, “We made the decision that, ‘Hey, we can support the next act of joy,’ which is, if you come by, show us a vaccine card, get a doughnut any time, any day, every day if you choose to.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

When reporters asked Biden how and whether Trump should be held accountable for his role in the Jan. 6 violent siege of the U.S. Capitol, he replied, "We\'ll let the Senate work that out." Politico summed up Biden\'s Trump impeachment strategy as: "Sit back and STFU." Biden allies explained to Politico and The Washington Post that the White House sees no upside, political or practical, in weighing in on Trump\'s impeachment. Biden is focused — and wants to be seen focusing — on taming the COVID-19 pandemic, notably pushing through his $1.9 billion coronavirus stimulus bill. Ignoring the Senate trial also echoes how Biden\'s team dealt with what Politico calls "Trumpian distractions" on the campaign trail, and, the Post notes, it "creates contrast with Trump, who at times appeared to weigh in on every controversy facing the country" and frequently watched TV during work hours. Besides, it\'s unlikely anything Biden says would tip the scales toward conviction, which requires 17 Senate Republicans to break with the former president. More broadly, Biden has indicated he wants to move past the Trump era. Still, "it is unclear if the White House will, or even can, be as removed from this political drama, as Biden and his aides suggest," the Post reports. "No sitting president has ever had to contend with the impeachment trial of his predecessor unfolding during his own presidency, let alone in the crucial opening weeks that often present the best opening for getting things done." The closest any president has come to that quandary is Gerald Ford, who replaced President Richard Nixon after he resigned rather than face impeachment and likely removal from office, Timothy Naftali, a historian who has written about impeachment and served as director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Museum and Library, told the Post. "Ford needed to find a way to turn the page." "I understand why Gerald Ford did what he did. But I think there was a cost to turning the corner as quickly as he did," Naftali added. "And I worry that, through an understandable concern about the pandemic, Joe Biden may be turning the corner too quickly."

Jeff Bezos, 56, the Amazon founder whose fortune is estimated at $182 billion, is still many tens of billions ahead of Musk at $127.9 billion. Fourth is luxury-goods magnate Bernard Arnault, 71; licking his wounds in lowly fifth place is Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, 36; while the sixth richest human is Warren Buffett, 90, with a pile of some $86 billion.Musk narrowly leapfrogged Gates, whose fortune is said to be $127.7 billion, on the Bloomberg chart following a further massive surge in Tesla’s share price, occasioned by news of the company being selected to join the S&P 500 index of leading U.S. companies a week ago. This saw the 49-year-old’s net worth rise by $7.2 billion.Incredibly, Musk’s wealth, which is intimately linked to the Tesla share price, has soared by more than $100 billion this year, making him by far the biggest gainer on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which lists the world’s 500 richest people. In January, Musk was in 35th place.Tesla’s shares have surged nearly 500 percent in 2020, driving its market value close to $500 billion. Three-quarters of Musk’s net worth comes from Tesla shares—he owns 21 percent of them.If Tesla can become a $650 billion company by 2028, Musk could net a bonus deal worth a record $55.8 billion, potentially eclipsing Bezos in the No. 1 spot. However whether Tesla can sustain its huge market value is the object of much debate; the company is expected to deliver around 320,000 electric vehicles this year, compared with Japanese carmaker Toyota’s annual production of about 10 million. Toyota has a market capitalization of around $236 billion.However, bulls argue that with sales of electric vehicles expected to triple over the next few years, Tesla is well-positioned for further exponential growth.The mercurial Musk is also a major player in the space industry; his company SpaceX last week sent four astronauts to the International Space Station on its Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule under a commercial contract with NASA. SpaceX is about to launch 60 broadband internet satellites into orbit.Gates, 65, who co-founded Microsoft, was the world’s richest person for years before being knocked off the top slot by Bezos in 2017. Gates has given more than $50 billion to help fight disease and poverty, mainly through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has also backed the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Bezos has seen his fortune drop back slightly since the height of the pandemic as Amazon’s share price has fallen on news of vaccines being successfully produced.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

People Face Increased Risks From Covid, but Many Don't Want the Vaccine", 'description': 'EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT SOME SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES — ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR — ARE HESITANT TO GET VACCINATED DUE TO MISTRUST OF THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT. At her last doctor’s appointment, Erica Tyler, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., joked that she didn’t want to get vaccinated for Covid-19 “because another foot might grow out of my forehead. And I’m not ready for that.” Ms. Tyler, 68, a cancer survivor who has diabetes and high blood pressure, lost her wife to a heart attack nearly a year ago and has been staying home throughout the pandemic to avoid becoming infected with the coronavirus. But when the vaccine became available, she did not rejoice. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “I was resistant,” Ms. Tyler said. She described feeling unsettled by the push to vaccinate minorities, especially given how Black people have been underserved or mistreated by the medical establishment in the past. “I felt that they were trying to storm people who they wanted to eliminate out of society,” she said, namely “the elderly and the Black people.” Research has shown that sexual and gender minorities, and especially people of color, are more vulnerable to becoming infected with the coronavirus and also more likely to have underlying conditions that could make them severely ill if they were to contract Covid-19. But many of the very people who are most at risk within these communities are also hesitant to take the vaccine, according to a recent study and interviews with health care workers as well as people of color who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer. “There’s an overarching mistrust around vaccination,” said Anthony Fortenberry, the chief nursing officer of the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, which provides medical care to L.G.B.T.Q. people in New York City. “They’re not sure if they want to get it.” Each of the three Covid vaccines currently available in the United States has been shown to be remarkably good at preventing serious illness and death. At Callen-Lorde, Mr. Fortenberry said he has counseled patients about the efficacy of the vaccine, eventually easing their fears. “They are not quick conversations,” he said. “They are addressing someone’s personal experiences and their history of discrimination.” But not everyone has a health care provider with whom they feel comfortable sharing their concerns. “I worry that without those conversations happening, people will continue to not get vaccinated,” he said. So far about 54 million people in the United States have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and of those nearly 28 million have been fully vaccinated. At Callen-Lorde and other medical centers that treat many L.G.B.T.Q. patients, health care workers say they have seen a higher demand for the vaccine among white patients compared to patients of color. L.G.B.T. people of color were twice as likely as white non-L.G.B.T. people to test positive for Covid-19, according to a Williams Institute study published in February. Even though Black people are more at risk for contracting the disease, concerns about the vaccine are especially prevalent among this population, experts say. In a study published this month in the journal Vaccines, 1,350 men and transgender women who predominantly identified as gay or bisexual reported how likely they would be to get a Covid‐19 vaccine. The Black participants expressed significantly more vaccine hesitancy than their white peers, the study found. Health care workers are encountering the same resistance in their patients. “Some people just literally said, ‘Well, no — Trump was involved in getting this vaccine going so I’m not going to get the vaccine,’” said Jill Crank, a nurse practitioner at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians in Baltimore. Studies show that hesitancy about the Covid vaccine occurs across all demographic groups, including those in the medical profession. About three in 10 health care workers are hesitant about getting the vaccine, according to a survey published in December by K.F.F. (previously the Kaiser Family Foundation) compared to about a quarter of the general population. Dezjorn Gauthier, 29, a Black transgender man who lives about 20 minutes from Milwaukee, said that although he is currently eligible to get the vaccine, he doesn’t want it. “Right now it’s a no-go,” said Mr. Gauthier, a model and business owner who has Covid-19 antibodies because he contracted the coronavirus last year. The vaccine’s development moved “so rapidly and so quickly, it just has me a little bit hesitant,” he said, adding that he’s also unsure about the vaccine’s ingredients. “There’s a fear in the community.” For members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and especially people of color, the hesitancy stems, in part, from pre-existing mistrust in the medical establishment, the experts said. The infamous Tuskegee study, which took place from 1932 to 1972, is one of the most egregious examples of racial discrimination in health care. The researchers recruited African-American men, some of whom were infected with syphilis, to observe the course of the disease. But the researchers did not disclose what they were studying or give the participants proper treatment, even as the men suffered and experienced severe health problems. The racial bias still found in medical care as well as the modern-day discrimination faced by sexual and gender minorities adds an additional burden. “The fear of being rejected is already there,” Ms. Crank said. “They may have already been rejected by their families, friends, co-workers — so it can cause a deep depression and lack of trust in anyone, including health care workers.” There are additional, different concerns about the vaccine among transgender people, advocates say, especially those who have received silicone injections or hormone replacement therapy. “How does that affect somebody who has been on estrogen for the last 20 years?” asked Maria Roman-Taylorson, a transgender person and the vice president and chief operations officer of the TransLatin@ Coalition, a nonprofit agency that provides social services to transgender, gender nonconforming and intersex people in Los Angeles. “There’s no data at all.” Dr. Kenneth Mayer, the medical research director at Fenway Health, a community health center in Boston where half of the patients identify as L.G.B.T.Q., said there’s no reason to believe that hormones or silicone would interact with the vaccine. “There’s not something intrinsic about being transgender that would make somebody more likely to respond poorly to the vaccine or have more side effects,” said Dr. Mayer, whose institution has enrolled over 200 participants in the largest, most recent AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine trial. Ms. Roman-Taylorson said she was initially hesitant to get vaccinated, but eventually decided to do it because she knew she needed to stay healthy to lead her agency. “I felt the benefit outweighed the risk,” she said. But, she added, “there’s some folks even within our organization who are not willing to take it because they don’t trust the process. They don’t trust how it’s been developed.” Although the vaccine was developed and manufactured quickly, “the safety steps were definitely not cut,” Dr. Mayer said, citing the independent data safety monitoring board that examines the data and the Food and Drug Administration’s stringent vetting process. “I really think this is an example of science going right,” he added. However, Dr. Mayer and others say there is a dearth of data about the L.G.B.T.Q. population. Representatives from both Pfizer and AstraZeneca said that they have not asked vaccine study participants to report their sexual orientation or gender identity. (Johnson & Johnson and Moderna did not immediately respond to emails asking about the demographic information they collect.) In addition, these categories are not included on the C.D.C.’s Covid-19 case report form, and only a handful of states and the District of Columbia have been working to collect such data when testing for Covid-19. Public health experts say vaccination is safe and that there are a number of reasons to believe that if sexual and gender minorities don’t get vaccinated, they are more at risk of contracting Covid and becoming severely ill than the general population. Last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report concluding that gay, lesbian and bisexual people in the United States had higher rates of self-reported underlying conditions like cancer, heart disease and obesity than heterosexual people and are also more likely to be smokers. These conditions put adults at increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19, the report said. The C.D.C. says that people with these types of conditions should receive the vaccine earlier than the general population. In addition, a recent study from New York State found that Covid patients with H.I.V. had higher rates of severe disease requiring hospitalization than those without an H.I.V. diagnosis. Men who have sex with men have the most new H.I.V. diagnoses in the United States, federal data shows. Socioeconomic status and geographic location can create additional health vulnerabilities, said Sean Cahill, director of health policy research at the Fenway Institute, a branch of Fenway Health that does policy analysis, conducts research and offers educational training around the world. According to a Human Rights Campaign Foundation analysis, L.G.B.T.Q. people are twice as likely to work in frontline professions like food service and retail as non-L.G.B.T.Q. people, which can raise the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Many sexual and gender minorities live in urban areas, where physical distancing measures are harder to maintain, Dr. Cahill said. Even those who can socially distance harbor skepticism about the need to vaccinate. “My girlfriend and I live a very secluded life but wear masks and protection everywhere we go,” said Rayshawn Stallings, 30, a transgender Black man who lives in Pensacola, Fla. “No one enters our home and we have no contact with anyone other than each other. So why would we need to get the vaccine?” As for Ms. Tyler, in Brooklyn, after speaking with seven of her friends who had taken the vaccine, none of whom had troubling side effects, she changed her mind and decided to get vaccinated. She received her first dose in February and is scheduled to get the second in mid-March. “I did not want to cut short my living by having to hide in my house,” she said. “So I took a leap of faith.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

However, in a new interview with NBC News, Pfizer’s CEO is now saying that a third shot may be necessary to achieve full protection. Read on to discover why you might need to get a third shot, and for more vaccination news, check out This Other Vaccine Could Already Be Protecting You From COVID, Study Says. You may need a third booster shot to address emerging mutations. During an interview with NBC News\'s Lester Holt, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla explained that by adding an additional third booster shot to the recommended two-dose vaccine, individuals will have greater protection against the highly infectious COVID variants that have recently been identified. “We believe that the third dose will raise the antibody response 10- to 20- fold,” said Bourla.Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten, MD, told Reuters recently, "The rate of mutations in the current virus is higher than expected. It’s a reasonable probability that we would end up with regular boosts."A preprint of a January study by BioNTech, which worked with Pfizer to create the vaccine, found that the doses are effective against the B.1.1.7. variant from the U.K., which is projected to become the dominant strain in the U.S. in March. But that may not be true with all mutations of the virus. For example, a February report from Pfizer and BioNTech, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the South African variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by approximately two-thirds.To prevent future widespread coronavirus infections, Pfizer plans to test the efficacy of modified versions of the company’s existing vaccine against mutations, starting with the South African variant. And if you want to know more about the latest vaccine, These Are the Side Effects of the New Johnson&Johnson Vaccine, FDA Says. These booster shots will likely become available quicker than the initial vaccine. Though it may have taken the better part of a year for the COVID vaccine to become available in the U.S., developing future boosters to address coronavirus mutants shouldn’t take quite as long. On Feb. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that vaccine companies could potentially file for Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for future coronavirus vaccines instead of conducting additional large-scale clinical trials. “In the case of investigational vaccines being developed for the prevention of COVID-19, any assessment regarding an EUA will be made on a case by case basis,” the FDA statement read. And for more vaccine advice from the nation\'s top agencies, check out The CDC Says Don’t Do This Within 2 Weeks of Your COVID Vaccine. The third shot will likely be the same brand as the first one or two you get. Pfizer is currently studying the efficacy of administering a third shot, and in a statement this week, Moderna said the company is also "evaluating booster doses of vaccine to increase neutralizing immunity against the variants of concern," including the South African variant. (Additionally, the single-dose vaccine from Johnson&Johnson, which should be approved for emergency use by the FDA this week, has proven to be quite effective in clinical trials in South Africa itself, where it was 82 percent against severe disease.) As is the case with your first and second doses, your booster will likely be from the same company as your initial vaccinations.While the precise timeframe for the most effective administration of the third shot has not yet been definitively determined, the time elapsed between participants\' first shot and their booster in the latest Pfizer trials is six months to a year, NBC News reports. And for the latest COVID news delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter. You may need to get a new COVID vaccine every year.

{'_id': '1562971dc4327e5378c32089368d5059', 'title': 'Team of retreads', 'description': "The shape of a future Biden administration is slowly coming into view along with a few of the president-elect's Cabinet picks. Thus far, the selections are exactly what one might have expected from a D.C. lifer like Biden — namely, other D.C. lifers. We have former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen at the Treasury Department, former Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to be the nation's top diplomat, Biden's previous chief of staff Ron Klain returning to the same job (only for the president this time), and former deputy secretary at Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas now up to run that department. All are longtime Democratic Party insiders, most close associates of Biden himself — and just like him, fresh off a turn of the revolving door.Already the conflict between the left and moderate wings of the Democratic coalition, which had slowed down for obvious reasons during the general election, has broken out again. Lefties and centrists are sniping at each other over several picks — on the left over the appalling policy records and Wall Street connections of various selections, and on the moderate side over the left not being team players.Because Biden will be president, at the end of the day he will have the Cabinet he wants. But so far there is little sign that his administration will satisfy a more elemental requirement — namely, the kind of ferocious determination and energetic vision that is a necessary precondition to repairing this shattered country.Take a look around: America is in dire shape. The economy is turning south thanks to the resurgent coronavirus pandemic and the long-expired CARES Act rescue being spent down. Mass foreclosures and evictions at a scale unseen since the 1930s are looming on the horizon if another rescue is not passed. We will apparently have a coronavirus vaccine soon, but Congress isn't even spending the relative pittance to make sure it can be distributed as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, Republicans are poised to gerrymander themselves an even bigger advantage in the House of Representatives and in multiple state legislatures. To even have a prayer of passing anything through the Senate, Democrats will need to sweep both runoff elections in Georgia in January. If they don't, then the Biden administration will have to lean on every legal authority in the U.S. Code to be able to do anything — and even then face the possibility that those actions will still be struck down by partisan hacks on the Supreme Court.Does Team Biden look up to this challenge? Yellen is reasonably progressive, but as Fed chair during the Obama administration, she voted for a number of interest rate hikes that — as I and many others pointed out at the time — were very obviously premature, conservatively guarding against inflation instead of aggressively pursuing full employment and higher wages, and indeed may have slowed the economy enough to hand the 2016 election to Trump. What's more, there are disturbing numbers of Wall Street insiders being handed deputy spots at Treasury, which may hem in even Yellen's mild progressivism. (A rare straightforward bright spot is Jared Bernstein, a smart and gregarious lefty economist selected for the Council of Economic Advisers, who has been on the right side of nearly all the important economic questions for the last decade.)Meanwhile, as Jonathan Guyer writes at The American Prospect, most of Biden's foreign policy team got rich openly peddling its connections to government over the last four years. Since the Trump administration was not much in favor of handing contracting gigs to firms full of professional Democrats, it's likely a safe bet that much of the money came from interested parties looking to essentially bribe future administration insiders. More broadly, people who have profited handsomely from status quo forces sending this country to the devil — endless pointless imperialism, legalized corruption, extreme policy timidity unless Wall Street is threatened — are not likely to countenance the sweeping action necessary to fix that status quo.Perhaps most telling is the selection of the President and CEO of the Center for American Progress, Neera Tanden, to run the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This is a sort of regulatory clearinghouse for the executive branch, and develops the administration's budget each year (which has no legal force but signals priorities and ideas). It's an ideal position for a quiet, competent, loyal manager — someone who will get the administration's business done efficiently without any fuss. But that description hardly fits Tanden's record.Tanden's politics, despite previous endorsements of austerity and stealing Libya's oil to pay for imperialist wars of aggression, are probably still to the left of Bruce Reed, who was reportedly previously under consideration for the OMB job and is best known for decreasing the income of the poorest single mothers with welfare reform in 1996. However, Tanden is also infamously quarrelsome. Articles which mention her routinely result in her complaining to editors in the middle of the night (full disclosure: myself included), and she is regularly found fighting with complete nobodies on Twitter (full disclosure: myself included). Nor is she well known for running a tight ship organizationally — according to The New York Times, she once literally punched a subordinate for asking Hillary Clinton about the Iraq War (though she says she only pushed him). She also clumsily outed the identity of a sexual harassment victim in an all-staff meeting, and under her leadership CAP disbanded its unionized journalism project ThinkProgress, then attempted to replace the staff with scabs, only to back down after a huge backlash. Whatever Biden wants to achieve, be it progressive, moderate, or otherwise, Tanden is a mystifying choice to put in arguably the most important administrative position.At any rate, this suggests a coalescing administration that is not exactly champing at the bit to clean up this smoking ruin of a country. It seems more like a collection of mostly bog-standard moderate liberals, some fairly earnest, some plainly just looking to pad out their resume for a few years before they go back to their buckraking private sector careers, and some in between — people who, on average, will not want to rock the boat too much, much less take the kind of extreme, norm-bending action that might upset future offerers of consulting contracts.Now, nobody would be happier than myself if Yellen turns out to be the second coming of FDR adviser Rexford Tugwell, or if Tanden turns OMB into a well-oiled machine. At least Biden has not hired any actual Republicans as Obama did, and so far his team thankfully does not appear to be worried about the national debt. But it is hard indeed to imagine this administration rising to the challenge of a country in worse shape than at any year since 1932.More stories from theweek.com  Our parents warned us the internet would break our brains.

Speaking at a Senate hearing on U.S. response to the virus, Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said this:               “These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have. These actually – we have clear scientific evidence they work, and they are our best defense. I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine. Because the immunogenicity may be 70%. And if I don’t get an immune response, the vaccine is not going to protect me. This face mask will.”               His comments came one day after President Trump, appearing on a televised town hall on ABC, was asked by an audience member why he did not support a national mask mandate and why he was rarely seen wearing a mask himself. Trump gave a lengthy response, which included references to restaurant staff touching their masks and ended with him saying: &quot;There are people that don’t think masks are good.&quot;               His presidential rival, Democrat and former Vice President Joe Biden, in a speech on Wednesday said that despite nearly 200,000 deaths from the virus in the U.S., Trump “still doesn’t have a plan to bring us out of this crisis” and added:               “He even said, and I quote, ‘A lot of people said that masks are not good’ – undercutting the easiest, most effective means we have for reducing the spread of this disease.”               Trump has also repeatedly stressed the speed with which a vaccine is being developed, telling Fox News on Tuesday, “We’re going to have a vaccine in a number of weeks, it could be 4 weeks.”                When asked point blank at the hearing Wednesday when a vaccine would be ready, the CDC’s Dr. Redfield gave a more sober timeline.                “If you’re asking me, ‘When is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of the vaccine to get back to our regular life,&#39; I think we’re probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter, 2021.”               Later at a press conference at the White House, Trump pushed back, saying Redfield had made a mistake and insisted that 100 million doses of the vaccine will be ready before the end of the year.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

But "scientists do not yet know whether COVID-19 vaccinations will reduce transmission because this was not tested in the trials."A new study from Israel\'s Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer suggested that the Pfizer vaccine does, in fact, reduce transmission. The small study of 102 medical workers found that after the second dose of the vaccine, 100 of the subjects had significantly higher levels of antibodies than even people who recovered from severe COVID-19 infections, The Jerusalem Post reports."The results of the survey are in line with Pfizer\'s experiment and even better than expected," said Prof. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of Sheba\'s Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit. "I expect that the survey results of the other employees participating will be similar. There is certainly reason for optimism." It isn\'t clear how long immunity will last, and the results are preliminary, but Regev-Yochay said it appears to her that fully vaccinate people won\'t shed the virus, meaning they won\'t pass it on to others."People who have received both doses of the vaccine have levels of antibodies ranging from six to 59," Regev-Yochay said. "These are high values, and it\'s encouraging and reasonable to assume that these people will not be carriers or contagious, although that is still not a direct conclusion."

And no one working on the federal response to the coronavirus is quite sure why.Members of President Joe Biden’s coronavirus task force have spent their first days in office working overtime to find an answer to this puzzle. So far, one hasn’t emerged.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 41.4 million doses have been handed out to the states. Only 21.8 million have been administered. Officials say they think there is a vaccine surplus, although how large of one is unclear. Bottom line: Doses should be flowing, they said But instead, states are complaining of vaccine shortages.Task force members rechecked the numbers—local and federal data— this week to try to discover the cause. They looked at whether there was enough being manufactured to fill demand; where that vaccine had been shipped and who had received it; how much was still sitting waiting to be administered; and how many doses were still sitting in warehouses. They’ve still come up short, officials tell The Daily Beast, in part because the data sets they are working with are incomplete.“What we are seeing now is incredible inefficiencies. You have cities canceling vaccination appointments while the data says they still haven’t administered a large portion of the vaccine that’s been shipped to them. That is the biggest problem,” said Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency doctor at New York Presbyterian Hospital.In the weeks leading up to the inauguration, officials working with Biden’s coronavirus transition task force assumed that the low vaccination rates were due in part to a lag in states reporting to the CDC. The actual vaccination rates were far higher than those reflected on the federal government’s dashboard, the officials believed. They also calculated that some states were struggling to administer the vaccine efficiently because of staff shortages and, in some regions, because of a hesitancy among residents to sign up for the shot. The idea was that as states began to work out the kinks in reporting and distribution, rates would rise and supply would eventually meet demand.Officials say they still believe all of that to be true. But the picture is even more muddled, and more complex, than they thought.According to two officials working on the administration’s vaccine effort, some state officials, including in those states reporting vaccine shortages, have determined there might be additional doses in their jurisdiction—outside of their second-dose reserves— that are unaccounted for. But those state officials do not know whether those doses are sitting in warehouses, freezers or in other distribution hubs, or whether they have been used but unreported. In other words, there could be perhaps millions of doses across the country missing in the distribution system, officials said. There could be a number of explanations to explain the discrepancies; some doses could have expired or been contaminated or otherwise destroyed, though those scenarios are rare.In response to a question about the discrepancy between states reporting shortages and the CDC alluding to the fact that there is a glut in vaccine doses across the country, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, said in a press conference that it would be “disturbing” if doses were found “laying around.”The underlying issue seems even more daunting and perhaps more difficult to remedy, according to those same two Biden officials and two other individuals who worked with the Biden transition. There are massive inefficiencies on the city, county, state, and federal levels. There isn’t just one—or two or three or four—problems with the vaccine distribution process, officials said; there are dozens. And finding solutions to those problems will require a level of communication and coordination between the federal government and states that hasn’t existed since the pandemic hit.Some cities lack comprehensive reporting systems to track where vaccines are located, whether there is adequate freezer storage, and whether doses are expiring on the shelf. And some states are having difficulty ensuring each distribution hub has enough vaccine supply for the appointments scheduled, in part because major cities in that state have their own separate distribution plan and tracking processes. Finally, some doses are getting held up as shipping companies are confused about which packages go where.Streamlining the distribution will take time, officials said. But the clock is ticking. Not only is there a political imperative—President Biden repeatedly laid out a goal of 100 million shots in the first 100 days—but the CDC has said that it expects a more contagious variant of COVID-19 to spread throughout the U.S. in the next several months. While health experts say the vaccine should work against that variant, the Biden administration wants to get as many Americans vaccinated as possible as a way to prevent another spike in COVID-related deaths this spring.‘Worse Than We Imagined’: Team Trump Left Biden a COVID NightmareCDC Officials Urge Biden Team to Dump Palantir’s COVID Tracker “There are real implications of this delay which is why we need to do this as quickly as possible. What I want to hear is that you’re willing to get every dose out and in someone’s arms. We can’t increase Pfizer or Moderna supply right now,” Spencer told The Daily Beast. “It’s going to take months.”After more than a week of calling on the federal government to send additional vaccine doses, hospitals, doctors’ offices, and pharmacies across the country late last week sent out notifications alerting thousands of Americans that they would have to cancel first-dose COVID-19 vaccinations due to a lack of supply.The U.S. vaccine rate is beginning to improve, but the mass cancellations prompted state leaders in states such as New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and California to speak out publicly about their shortages and the need for the federal government to do more to help. It was a familiar tone—one put to the Trump administration by governors who said they lacked testing and medical supplies and personal protective equipment needed to contain the spread of the virus. “The supply that we’re going to get next week is already 30,000 doses underneath our ability of what we can put in someone’s arm in just a seven-day span,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a press conference Jan. 20. Kentucky has begun canceling some vaccine appointments due to the shortage. According to the CDC’s vaccine tracker, the state has received 471,000 vaccine doses but has only administered 299,493. According to data gathered by The Washington Post, the doses that Kentucky has administered has covered just 24.8 percent of the prioritized population.Although governors across the country are dealing with increasingly frustrated and disheartened constituents, some of whom have had their vaccine appointments canceled over the last two weeks because of shortages, officials with the Biden COVID-19 task force say they’re not too concerned about the supply issue. At least not yet.“It’s better to have the demand… to have vaccine sitting on shelves even if there are lines and queues, than to have people not wanting to sign up and take it,” one individual working on the administration’s vaccine effort said, adding that the Biden team expects supply and demand to swing back and forth over the coming months as the country recalibrates the distribution process.Officials point to the decision made earlier this month to widen the pool of those who could receive the vaccine as a reason for the increase in demand for the shot. The Biden team and the outgoing Trump administration made the decision that they would recommend states allow individuals 65 and older and outside of the first wave of vaccine eligibility—people other than health-care, frontline workers and nursing home residents—receive the shot if they wanted. But officials say there was never a reserve of doses, even those the Trump administration said it had set aside as second-dose shots, to help states handle the increasing number of people signing up for vaccine appointments. In an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt Jan. 15 that the U.S. did not have a reserve stockpile.States weren’t made aware of the reserve issue until it was too late—until they had scheduled hundreds of thousands of additional vaccine appointments.Meanwhile, distribution hubs across the country were creating rules about who should and could get the vaccination and when on the fly. According to an individual who worked in one of New York City’s distribution hubs, volunteers did not ask for identification and sometimes forgot to ask for appointment confirmation. Volunteers at this particular hub rotated on a daily basis, this person said, and often received little instruction about how to run the distribution process. “We were just reinventing the wheel every day.”Two individuals who spoke to The Daily Beast said they found a primary care health-care office in Jersey City, New Jersey where they could receive their first dose even though they were residents of New York.In Fairfax, Virginia, a vaccine volunteer said his staff last week made the decision to hand out the shot to not only those who had made appointments but also anyone who accompanied those individuals to the distribution site.It’s that lack of communication, and each state approaching the decision to vaccinate a wider pool of people differently, that has federal officials on edge. One senior health official said there was discussion in the Trump administration about the piecemeal vaccination distribution approach causing problems during the rollout. Those concerns were largely shot down, the official said, adding that states were rushed to submit their vaccination distribution reports and “barely had time to speak to the federal government about those plans before the vaccine shipped.”“We knew this was coming,” the official said. “To some extent there was always going to be problems with a distribution campaign of this size and complexity. Things are bound to improve. But I’m not sure things had to get this bad.”White House officials say they plan to hold a virtual meeting with the nation’s governors Tuesday to discuss vaccine distribution. But the federal government has no plans to increase vaccine supply at this time, officials said.Over the next several weeks the Biden team plans to work closely with states to assess how many doses are already distributed that need to be accounted for, how many appointments have already been booked for first- and second-dose shots, and how many vaccine doses have been requested by states that have yet to be allocated. “Right now there’s no holistic way of accounting for all that,” one Biden official said.Another official said there are discussions underway about the possibility of changing the way local health departments report their vaccination numbers to the federal government as a way to improve the administration’s understanding of the distribution effort.In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has established a new interagency vaccination task force in the agency’s National Response Coordination Center and is set to deploy staff to support dozens of vaccination sites across the country to help with distribution, according to a spokesperson for the agency.In the meantime, Biden will tap the Defense Production Act to compel manufacturers to produce more personal protective equipment and to continue to scale testing across the country. Officials say Biden will also use the act and to develop more raw materials and syringes needed to increase vaccine production. Biden signed an executive order last week that allows federal agencies to “to fill those shortfalls as soon as practicable by acquiring additional stockpiles, improving distribution systems, building market capacity, or expanding the industrial base.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

{'_id': '47ae421857a1c9b22dadeee6af2dcfac', 'title': 'Time for Americans to Take Back Power from Teachers’ Unions', 'description': 'Tuesday was supposed to be a big day for a lot of kids in Oakland — they were supposed to be going back to school. Some of them were to be going to school for the first time. Unfortunately, it’s not going to happen. A deal between the school district and the teachers’ union had provided for reopening all of Oakland’s elementary schools, but, in spite of the deal, more than half of teachers are declining to return to the classroom, and so most of Oakland’s schools will not reopen as scheduled. Out of 50 pre-K and elementary schools covered by the agreement, only 21 — fewer than half — will reopen. A substantial number of teachers — almost a fifth — have indicated that they do not intend to return to school as required in mid April. While acknowledging the damage this is doing to children — isolation, depression, and other mental-health issues — Oakland School Board Director Shanthi Gonzales pleaded powerlessness, telling the San Francisco Chronicle, “I wish more teachers were volunteering.” That is what you get when the school district works for the teachers and not the other way around: schools in which the interests of children and their families take a distant second place to the desires of the public-sector unions that dominate Democratic politics around the country and run the show practically unopposed in California. This isn’t bare-knuckle labor politics — it’s political child abuse. The Centers for Disease Control has said that schools can be safely reopened while maintaining social distancing of as little as three feet. And, as we all know, the pronouncements of the CDC are the gold standard for our progressive friends — right up until they run into the demands of an important Democratic constituency, at which point, they become trash. American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten says she’s “not convinced” by the CDC’s advice. Weingarten, a lawyer by education and a union goon by profession, is, to say the least, not very well prepared to critically review the CDC’s public-health findings. We have been through a great deal in the past year, with the schools and other institutions taking extraordinary measures that were generally, even when we disagreed, understandable. But 100 million Americans have now received at least one dose of one of the COVID-19 vaccines, and the research overwhelmingly finds that elementary-school education is a relatively low-risk proposition — and that every additional unnecessary delay in the return of ordinary education does real and lasting damage to children, especially to those whose families do not have the resources to adequately pick up the slack. A great many people have worked throughout this terrible episode, many at some considerable personal risk, and not only doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers but also grocery clerks, warehouse workers, and taxi drivers. They have kept the country running while unionized teachers in Oakland and elsewhere have turned up their noses at the children they are supposed to be serving and looked instead to their own two-point agenda: (1) not going to work; (2) getting paid. Randi Weingarten exercises more real practical political power than any senator or cabinet secretary, and her power is exercised exclusively in the interest of public-sector workers and the Democratic Party, which they effectively control. Perhaps it is time for Americans to take back some of that power.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'b73e5cf6522a810e028717c556c04465', 'title': 'Ivanka Trump Says She Created Jobs For Women. The Truth Is More Complicated.', 'description': 'During a Republican National Convention with a head-spinning amount of lies and potentially illegal activity, Ivanka Trump again attempted to present herself as the reasonable and rational member of her family with her speech on Thursday night. Maybe it would have worked, if you didn’t actually listen to what she said. Her speech — which covered the economy, criminal justice reform, and Republicans’ favorite subject, cancel culture —\xa0painted nearly as fictional a vision of America as her father’s, further amplifying the surreality of seeing the First Family addressing Americans from the South Lawn of the White House on the final night of the RNC. Never mind the fact that Ivanka, who said she was praying “for the families who are mourning the loss of a loved one” to the coronavirus pandemic, spoke in front of a largely maskless crowd, most of whom hadn’t been tested for COVID-19 — unless they came in close proximity to the president, of course. Or the grotesque display of tastelessness that capped off the four-day convention in the form of fireworks and an opera singer with a wedding-ceremony repertoire.But even putting all that aside, Ivanka’s central scam relies on who she claims she represents — the working mom. The mother of three, who has been trying to portray herself as the queen of “working women” and job creation since the beginning of the administration,\xa0repeatedly lied about what the administration has done for\xa0women, working parents, and caregivers in the substance of her speech.\xa0“Four years ago in Cleveland, I said President Trump would deliver for working women. Last year, over 70% of all new jobs were secured by women,” she said. Ivanka’s statement isn’t wrong: Women did account for the majority of job growth in 2019, outnumbering men in the workforce for only the second time. But, it’s also not the whole truth, and ignores important context: In the last several months, the pandemic has caused unemployment to jump from a historically low 3.6% to a record of 14.7 in April (it’s now above 10%). Despite having made job gains in 2019, women have been disproportionately affected by the crisis.More women than men lost their jobs from February to May — 11.5 million versus 9 million, according to Pew Research — with industries like leisure and hospitality, retail, and childcare disproportionately gutted. While about a third of those jobs returned in May and June, experts say many of those industries are still highly vulnerable and likely to be affected by another shutdown. The Trump administration’s mismanagement of the pandemic has hurt Black women, Latinx women, immigrants, younger women, and working-class women particularly hard. Not that you’d know it from Ivanka’s speech, but one in five childcare workers have lost their jobs. Perhaps she neglected to mention that because she hardly ever acknowledges her own childcare workers while extolling her own virtues as a working mom.Speaking of childcare, Ivanka made sure to praise her father’s childcare tax credit (which leaves out poor families and helps out high earners) and paid leave tax credit (which is extremely limited), symbolic policies that don’t do much to help the majority of working women. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s ambitious universal childcare plan and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s comprehensive, state-tested paid family leave proposal are languishing in the U.S. Senate.Ivanka acknowledged none of the harsh economic realities of the pandemic. Perhaps this is because there’s no positive way to spin the way that the coronavirus has obliterated our economy, aided, in part, with the administration’s failure to impose a mask mandate or a national lockdown — or really any policies that respect the existing science. Even now, the Republicans’ only plan seems to be a vaccine and scientifically unproven “miracle” cures like hydroxychloroquine.President Trump himself, too, pined for the economy of several months ago in his address: “Before the China virus came in, [the U.S.] produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded,” he said, once again using a racist term to describe the pandemic. Yes, we had record-low unemployment, rising wages, growing GDP, and a healthy stock market —\xa0an economic recovery Trump largely inherited from Obama. Now, we have none of those things.Since the beginning of the administration, Ivanka has tried to paint herself as a “job creation Barbie” of sorts — a diminishing term, but one she has earned, filling her Instagram with photos of herself visiting factories, wearing a hardhat, riding a forklift, and even as an astronaut. Her signature initiative, the Pledge to America’s Workers involves “committing to expand programs that educate, train, and reskill American workers from high-school age to near-retirement.” According to the White House, over 430 companies and organizations have signed the pledge, contributing to over 16 million new education and training opportunities. But the program doesn’t amount to actual jobs, only proposed training opportunities. Plus, CNN reported, many of these opportunities had already been planned by the companies themselves before Ivanka strode in. Those “millions of jobs” (14 million in fact, a number that’s more than the total amount of jobs the American economy created by that point) the president boasted last year that his daughter herself has somehow created, are a pure fantasy.Ivanka’s jobs-queen cosplay extends into other ventures, like her out-of-touch Women Who Work book, which features such gems of advice as “Honor yourself by exploring the kind of life you deserve” and her ill-fated fashion brand, also targeting “women who work.” Just like her speech, these ventures treat women — including those who work —\xa0as an abstraction, a demographic you can pacify with inspirational Pinterest quotes.\xa0Her father is not the job-creation machine she described in her speech, either. Overall, the president likes to boast that his administration is “producing jobs like you have never seen before in this country” due to his renegotiation on major trade deals like NAFTA. During Trump’s first three years in office, the U.S. economy gained 6.6 million jobs, a respectable number — but nowhere near a record one. Other presidents saw better job creation after three years: 8.5 million jobs for Bill Clinton and 10.1 million jobs for Jimmy Carter. During President Barack Obama’s last three years, the economy added 8.1 million jobs. (While Obama’s first term saw little job creation, he also took office in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.)\xa0Of course, all of these are boring facts when you’re Ivanka and your number-one concern is trying to make your father seem palatable to swing voters in the suburbs, particularly women. And those white, well-off suburban women she’s targeting haven’t been as affected by the job crisis —\xa0so they’re more likely to believe her. But who’s going to fact-check the Trumps? Certainly not their base.Like what you see?

From Tuesday, only two Scots from two households can meet outside, with the limit not including children under 12, and people are only allowed to leave their homes for a limited range of reasons such as food shopping. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, of Police Scotland, said his officers will increase their patrols and "visible presence" in Scotland\'s communities. He added: "Where officers encounter wilful breaches, they will act decisively to enforce the law." Ms Sturgeon said people who are shielding must not return to their workplace after the festive holiday, and ordered all employees to work from home if possible.

Each of them demonstrated symptoms of anaphylactoid reaction, leading U.K. authorities to advise anyone with that condition to not take the vaccine. Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued its own warning. Read on to hear it, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.\xa0Use Caution if You "Have Experienced Severe Allergic Reactions"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading infectious disease expert, was asked if he agrees with the U.K. directive. "I do. I do," he said. "We are very carefully monitoring these things. And when we see something like an allergic reaction, you modify the recommendation and you say that someone who has a history of a severe allergic reaction, that those individuals don\'t get vaccinated now with this product, or if they do get vaccinated, they do it in a location that has the capability of responding to an allergic reaction." Officially, the FDA says "you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if you:\xa0had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine\xa0had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine."The CDC weighed on December 19th, with the following posting:"CDC has learned of reports that some people have experienced severe allergic reactions—also known as anaphylaxis—after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. As an example, an allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen© or if they must go to the hospital.If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911."What the CDC RecommendsThe CDC goes on: "If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, CDC recommends that you should not get that specific vaccine. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injectable therapies, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. Your doctor will help you decide if it is safe for you to get vaccinated.RELATED: 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say DoctorsCDC recommends that people with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injectable medications—such as allergies to food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex—may still get vaccinated. People with a history of allergies to oral medications or a family history of severe allergic reactions, or who might have an milder allergy to vaccines (no anaphylaxis)—may also still get vaccinated.If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist in allergies and immunology to provide more care or advice."Safeguards Are in PlaceSays the CDC: "CDC has provided recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination providers about how to prepare for the possibility of a severe allergic reaction:All people who get a COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored on-site. People with a history of severe allergic reactions should be monitored for 30 minutes after getting the vaccine. All other people should be monitored for 15 minutes after getting the vaccine.Vaccination providers should have appropriate medications and equipment—such as epinephrine, antihistamines, stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and timing devices to check your pulse—at all COVID-19 vaccination sites.If you experience a severe allergic reaction after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, vaccination providers should provide rapid care and call for emergency medical services. You should continue to be monitored in a medical facility for at least several hours.Learn more about what to expect after getting vaccinated for COVID-19, including normal side effects and tips to reduce pain or discomfort."How to Survive the PandemicAs for yourself, the vaccine is not yet available to those who aren\'t the highest priority, so follow Dr. Fauci\'s fundamentals and help end this surge—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don\'t go indoors with people you\'re not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene and to protect your life and the lives of others, don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Here Is Why.', 'description': 'The scattered reports from around the country can play like a cruel irony: Someone tests positive for the coronavirus even though they have already received one or both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Notable Examples It has happened to at least three members of Congress recently: Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times — Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y. — Stephen Lynch, D-Mass. — Lori Trahan, D-Mass. But it has been reported in people in other walks of life, too, including Rick Pitino, a Hall of Fame basketball coach, and a nurse in California. How Can That Happen? Experts say cases like these are not surprising and do not indicate that there was something wrong with the vaccines or how they were administered. Here is why. — Vaccines don’t work instantly. It takes a few weeks for the body to build up immunity after receiving a dose. And the vaccines now in use in the United States, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, both require a second shot a few weeks after the first to reach full effectiveness. — Nor do they work retroactively. You can already be infected and not know it when you get the vaccine — even if you recently tested negative. That infection can continue to develop after you get the shot but before its protection fully takes hold, and then show up in a positive test result. — The vaccines prevent illness, but maybe not infection. COVID vaccines are being authorized based on how well they keep you from getting sick, needing hospitalization and dying. Scientists don’t know yet how effective the vaccines are at preventing the coronavirus from infecting you to begin with, or at keeping you from passing it on to others. (That is why vaccinated people should keep wearing masks and maintaining social distance.) — Even the best vaccines aren’t perfect. The efficacy rates for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are extremely high, but they are not 100%. With the virus still spreading out of control in the United States, some of the millions of recently vaccinated people were bound to get infected in any case.

{'_id': 'd2adc7efcf65df8b588400c77d796031', 'title': 'Could a Blood Test Show if a COVID-19 Vaccine Works?', 'description': 'A new study in monkeys suggests that a blood test could predict the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine -- and perhaps speed up the clinical trials needed to get a working vaccine to billions of people around the world.The study, published Friday in Nature, reveals telltale blood markers that predict whether a monkey\'s immune system is prepared to wipe out incoming coronaviruses.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe finding raises hope that researchers will be able to look for the same markers in people who get vaccines in clinical trials. If the markers are strong enough, they could reveal if the vaccines protect against COVID-19. And researchers would no longer have to wait for some trial volunteers to get the disease, as they do now."It will pave the way for a much more rapid advancement of the COVID vaccine field," said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and one of the researchers behind the new study.Last month brought the stunning news that clinical trials of two new coronavirus vaccines, one from Moderna and the other from Pfizer and BioNTech, showed efficacy rates around 95%.The strength of these two vaccines is, paradoxically, bad news for the dozens of others in earlier stages of development. Many of them will most likely have to be compared against the robust front-runners rather than a placebo shot. Because that is a high statistical bar to clear, their trials will need a lot more volunteers, time and money."You\'d have to follow millions of people for a long time," said Dr. Nelson Michael, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, where a protein-based vaccine is being prepared for clinical trials in early 2021. "It\'s just fantasy."For some smaller companies, these comparison trials may be deal-breakers. "You\'re going to see a lot of dropout," said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic.That\'s a big problem, because Pfizer and Moderna won\'t have nearly enough doses to give to everyone in the United States, let alone the world. And the next wave of vaccines may turn out to be superior to the first in one way or the other. They could cost a lot less, for example. Some might come in just one dose instead of two and won\'t need a deep freeze. Some might offer protection that lasts a lot longer."We\'d rather not have to revaccinate the world every one or two years," Michael said.The new monkey study offers a ray of hope for these next-generation vaccines, suggesting that they could be tested not against older vaccines but using a measurement known as a "correlate of protection.""That\'s the holy grail of vaccine research," Michael said.Influenza vaccines are already tested this way. Every new flu season requires the design of a new flu shot, but researchers don\'t have to run clinical trials comparing it with old versions. Instead, they just check whether the new vaccine triggers a person\'s immune system to make enough of a certain kind of antibody against the flu. If it does, then researchers know the vaccine is adequately stimulating the immune system.If scientists could discover a correlate of protection against the coronavirus, they could follow the example of the flu. "That is an entirely plausible and feasible scenario," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration said that basing clinical trials on correlates of protection -- if they turn out to exist -- "possibly could be considered in the future."In their new study, Barouch and his colleagues found a correlate of protection in monkeys. They built the experiment on their previous research showing that once monkeys recover from COVID-19, they can resist a second infection. The scientists drew blood from these exposed animals and isolated an array of protective antibodies called IgG.The researchers set out to see if there was a level of IgG that reliably protected monkeys from COVID-19. If the IgG antibodies produced by vaccines were above that level, the vaccines could be judged effective.To find that line, the researchers gave monkeys varying doses of antibodies and then exposed them all to the coronavirus and watched how well they fought off the infection. In the monkeys with the weakest dose, the viruses multiplied much as they would in an ordinary animal.But the monkeys that got a medium dose produced far fewer viruses. Some of them were able to wipe out the viruses altogether. At the highest dose, the monkeys were completely protected.Until now, scientists relied on circumstantial evidence that suggested IgG antibodies were crucial to clearing coronavirus infections. The new study puts that idea to the test -- and determines the threshold of IgG antibodies required to ward off an infection."This is the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that we\'ve actually proven that antibodies protect," Barouch said. "Everything else has been a statistical association."The experiment revealed that a modest amount of IgG antibodies turned out to be enough. That could be heartening news for vaccine developers because even so-so vaccines may be able to cross the threshold.Researchers are now starting to review the results of vaccine clinical trials to see if a correlate of protection like the one identified by Barouch and his colleagues in monkeys exists in people. "The study bodes well for the upcoming immune correlates studies," said Holly Janes, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute in Seattle who was not involved in Barouch\'s study.Although it will take some time for those studies to produce solid results, Janes said preliminary hints made her optimistic."The emerging data do suggest that we could be gleefully surprised," she said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

This whole thing is! We\'ve got all the damn cases," Trump yelled at Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, during a gathering of top aides in the Oval Office on Aug. 19. "I want to do what Mexico does. They don\'t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you\'re vomiting."Mexico\'s record in fighting the virus was hardly one for the United States to emulate. But the president had long seen testing not as a vital way to track and contain the pandemic but as a mechanism for making him look bad by driving up the number of known cases.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAnd on that day he was especially furious after being informed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, that it would be days before the government could give emergency approval to the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment, something Trump was eager to promote as a personal victory going into the Republican National Convention the following week."They\'re Democrats! They\'re against me!" he said, convinced that the government\'s top doctors and scientists were conspiring to undermine him. "They want to wait!"Throughout late summer and fall, in the heat of a reelection campaign that he would go on to lose, and in the face of mounting evidence of a surge in infections and deaths far worse than in the spring, Trump\'s management of the crisis -- unsteady, unscientific and colored by politics all year -- was in effect reduced to a single question: What would it mean for him?The result, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former administration officials and others in contact with the White House, was a lose-lose situation. Trump not only ended up soundly defeated by Joe Biden, but missed his chance to show that he could rise to the moment in the final chapter of his presidency and meet the defining challenge of his tenure.Efforts by his aides to persuade him to promote mask wearing, among the simplest and most effective ways to curb the spread of the disease, were derailed by his conviction that his political base would rebel against anything that would smack of limiting their personal freedom. Even his own campaign\'s polling data to the contrary could not sway him.His explicit demand for a vaccine by Election Day -- a push that came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting with top health aides in late September -- became a misguided substitute for warning the nation that failure to adhere to social distancing and other mitigation efforts would contribute to a slow-rolling disaster this winter.His concern? That the man he called "Sleepy Joe" Biden, who was leading him in the polls, would get credit for a vaccine, not him.The government\'s public health experts were all but silenced by the arrival in August of Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the Stanford professor of neuroradiology recruited after appearances on Fox News.With Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House virus task force, losing influence and often on the road, Atlas became the sole doctor Trump listened to. His theories, some of which scientists viewed as bordering on the crackpot, were exactly what the president wanted to hear: The virus is overblown, the number of deaths are exaggerated, testing is overrated, lockdowns do more harm than good.As the gap between politics and science grew, the infighting that Trump had allowed to plague the administration\'s response from the beginning only intensified. Threats of firings worsened the leadership vacuum as key figures undercut each other and distanced themselves from responsibility.The administration had some positive stories to tell. Trump\'s vaccine development program, Operation Warp Speed, had helped drive the pharmaceutical industry\'s remarkably fast progress in developing several promising approaches. By the end of the year, two highly effective vaccines would be approved for emergency use, providing hope for 2021.The White House rejected any suggestions that the president\'s response had fallen short, saying he had worked to provide adequate testing, protective equipment and hospital capacity and that the vaccine development program had succeeded in record time."President Trump has led the largest mobilization of the public and private sectors since WWII to defeat COVID-19 and save lives," said Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesperson.But Trump\'s unwillingness to put aside his political self-centeredness as Americans died by the thousands each day or to embrace the steps necessary to deal with the crisis remains confounding even to some administration officials. "Making masks a culture war issue was the dumbest thing imaginable," one former senior adviser said.His own bout with COVID-19 in early October left him extremely ill and dependent on care and drugs not available to most Americans, including a still-experimental monoclonal antibody treatment, and he saw firsthand how the disease coursed through the White House and some of his close allies.Yet his instinct was to treat that experience not as a learning moment or an opportunity for empathy, but as a chance to portray himself as a Superman who had vanquished the disease. His own experience to the contrary, he assured a crowd at the White House just a week after his hospitalization, "It\'s going to disappear; it is disappearing."Weeks after his own recovery, he would still complain about the nation\'s preoccupation with the pandemic."All you hear is COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID," Trump said at one campaign stop, uttering the word 11 times.In the end he could not escape it.\'The Base Will Revolt\'By late July, new cases were at record highs, defying Trump\'s predictions through the spring that the virus was under control, and deaths were spiking to alarming levels. Herman Cain, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate, died from the coronavirus. The previous month he had attended a Trump rally without a mask.With the pandemic defining the campaign despite Trump\'s efforts to make it about law and order, Tony Fabrizio, the president\'s main pollster, came to the Oval Office for a meeting in the middle of the summer prepared to make a surprising case: that mask wearing was acceptable even among Trump\'s supporters.Arrayed in front of the Resolute Desk, Trump\'s advisers listened as Fabrizio presented the numbers. According to his research, some of which was reported by The Washington Post, voters believed the pandemic was bad and getting worse, they were more concerned about getting sick than about the virus\'s effects on their personal financial situation, the president\'s approval rating on handling the pandemic had hit new lows and a little more than half the country did not think he was taking the situation seriously.But what set off debate that day was Fabrizio\'s finding that more than 70% of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans.Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a "no-brainer."Kushner had some reason for optimism. Trump had agreed to wear one not long before for a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after finding one he believed he looked good in: dark blue, with a presidential seal.But Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff -- backed up by other aides including Stephen Miller -- said the politics for Trump would be devastating."The base will revolt," Meadows said, adding that he was not sure Trump could legally make it happen in any case.That was all Trump needed to hear. "I\'m not doing a mask mandate," he concluded.Aside from when he was sick, he was rarely seen in a mask again.The president had other opportunities to show leadership rather than put his political fortunes first.After he recovered from his bout with the virus, some of his top aides, including Kushner and Jason Miller, a senior campaign strategist, thought the illness offered an opportunity to demonstrate the kind of compassion and resolve about the pandemic\'s toll that Trump had so far failed to show.When Trump returned from the hospital, his communications aides, with the help of Ivanka Trump, his daughter, urged him to deliver a national address in which he would say: "I had it. It was tough, it kicked my ass, but we\'re going to get through it."He refused, choosing instead to address a boisterous campaign rally for himself from the balcony of the White House overlooking the South Lawn.Trump never came around to the idea that he had a responsibility to be a role model, much less that his leadership role might require him to publicly acknowledge hard truths about the virus -- or even to stop insisting that the issue was not a rampaging pandemic but too much testing.Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, briefed the president this fall on a Japanese study documenting the effectiveness of face masks, telling him: "We have the proof. They work." But the president resisted, criticizing Kushner for pushing them and again blaming too much testing -- an area Kushner had been helping to oversee -- for his problems."I\'m going to lose," Trump told Kushner during debate preparations. "And it\'s going to be your fault, because of the testing."Morgenstern, the White House spokesperson, said that exchange between the president and Kushner "never happened."Azar, who was sometimes one of the few people wearing a mask at White House events, privately bemoaned what he called a political, anti-mask culture set by Trump. At White House Christmas parties, Azar asked maskless guests to back away from him.Divisions and DisagreementsThe decision to run the government\'s response out of the West Wing was made in the early days of the pandemic. The idea was to break down barriers between disparate agencies, assemble public health expertise and encourage quick and coordinated decision-making.It did not work out like that, and by fall the consequences were clear.Trump had always tolerated if not encouraged clashes among subordinates, a tendency that in this case led only to policy paralysis, confusion about who was in charge and a lack of a clear, consistent message about how to reduce the risks from the pandemic.Keeping decision-making power close to him was another Trump trait, but in this case it also elevated the myriad choices facing the administration to the presidential level, bogging the process down in infighting, raising the political stakes and encouraging aides to jockey for favor with Trump.The result at times was a systemwide failure that extended well beyond the president."What we needed was a coordinated response that involved contributions from multiple agencies," said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the Trump administration."Someone needed to pull that all together early," he said. "It wasn\'t the job of the White House, either. This needed to happen closer to the agencies. That didn\'t happen on testing, or on a whole lot of other things."The relationship between Azar and Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, grew increasingly tense; by early November, they were communicating only by text and in meetings.Birx had lost the clout she enjoyed early on in the crisis and spent much of the summer and fall on the road counseling governors and state health officials.Meadows was at odds with almost everyone as he sought to impose the president\'s will on scientists and public health professionals. In conversations with top health officials, Meadows would rail against regulatory "bureaucrats" he thought were more interested in process than outcome.Some of the doctors on the task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, were reluctant to show up in person at the White House, worried that the disdain there for mask wearing and social distancing would leave them at risk of infection.Vice President Mike Pence was nominally in charge of the task force but was so cautious about getting crosswise with Trump as they battled for reelection that, in public at least, he became nearly invisible.The debates inside the White House increasingly revolved around Atlas, who had no formal training in infectious diseases but whose views -- which Trump saw him deliver on Fox News -- appealed to the president\'s belief that the crisis was overblown.His arrival at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. was itself something of a mystery. Some aides said he was discovered by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary. Others said John McEntee, the president\'s personnel chief, had been Googling for a Trump-friendly doctor who would be loyal.Marc Short, Pence\'s chief of staff, opposed hiring Atlas. But once the president and his team brought him in, Short insisted that Atlas have a seat at the task force table, hoping to avoid having him become yet another internal -- and destructive -- critic.Once inside, Atlas used the perch of a West Wing office to shape the response. During a meeting in early fall, Atlas asserted that college students were at no risk from the virus. We should let them go back to school, he said. It\'s not a problem.Birx exploded. What aspect of the fact that you can be asymptomatic and still spread it do you not understand? she demanded. You might not die, but you can give it to somebody who can die from it. She was livid."Your strategy is literally going to cost us lives," she yelled at Atlas. She attacked Atlas\' ideas in daily emails she sent to senior officials. And she was mindful of a pact she had made with Hahn, Fauci and Redfield even before Atlas came on board: They would stick together if one of them was fired for doing what they considered the right thing.Health officials often had a hard time finding an audience in the upper reaches of the West Wing. In a mid-November task force meeting, they issued a dire warning to Meadows about the looming surge in cases set to devastate the country. Meadows demanded data to back up their claim.One outcome of the meeting was a Nov. 19 news conference on the virus\'s dire threat, the first in many weeks. But while Pence, who led the briefing, often urged Americans to "do their part" to slow the spread of the virus, he never directly challenged Trump\'s hesitancy on masks and social distancing. At the briefing, he said that "decision-making at the local level" was key, continuing a long pattern of the administration seeking to push responsibility to the states.Azar had been cut out of key decision-making as early as February, when Pence took over the task force. Azar would complain to his associates that Pence\'s staff and task force members went around him to issue orders to his subordinates.On tenterhooks about his job status, Azar found an opening that offered a kind of redemption, steering his attention through the summer and fall to Operation Warp Speed, the government\'s effort to support rapid development of a vaccine, lavishing praise on Trump and crediting him for nearly every advance.Behind the scenes, Azar portrayed Hahn to the White House as a flailing manager -- a complaint he also voiced about Redfield. In late September, he told the White House he was willing to fire Hahn, according to officials familiar with the offer.For their part, Hahn, Redfield, Birx and other senior health officials saw Azar as crushing the morale of the agencies he oversaw as he sought to escape blame for a worsening crisis and to strengthen his own image publicly and with the White House.Health officials on the task force several times took their complaints about Azar to Pence\'s office, hoping for an intervention.Caitlin B. Oakley, a spokesperson for Azar, said he had "always stood up for balanced, scientific, public health information and insisted that science and data drive the decisions."Once eager to visit the White House, Hahn became disillusioned with what he saw as its efforts to politicize the work of the Food and Drug Administration, and he eventually shied away from task force meetings, fearing his statements there would leak.If there was a bureaucratic winner in this West Wing cage match, it was Atlas.He told Trump that the right way to think about the virus was how much "excess mortality" there was above what would have been expected without a pandemic.Trump seized on the idea, often telling aides that the real number of dead was no more than 10,000 people.As of Thursday, 342,577 Americans had died from the pandemic.Trump vs. Vaccine RegulatorsIn an Oval Office meeting with senior health officials on Sept. 24, the president made explicit what he had long implied: He wanted a vaccine before the election, according to three people who witnessed his demand.Pfizer\'s chief executive had been encouraging the belief that the company could deliver initial results by late October. But Trump\'s aides tried in vain to make clear that they could not completely control the timing.Fauci and Hahn reminded West Wing officials that a company\'s vaccine trial results were a "black box," impossible to see until an independent monitoring board revealed them. A vaccine that did not go through the usual, rigorous government approval process would be a "Pyrrhic victory," Azar told them. It would be a shot no one would take.Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, said the president never asked him to deliver a vaccine on a specific timetable. But he said Trump sometimes complained in meetings that "it was not going to happen before the election and it will be \'Sleepy Joe\'" who would ultimately get credit.In late October, science and regulations worked against Trump\'s waning hopes for pre-Election Day good news. At the FDA, scientists had refined the standards for authorizing a vaccine for emergency use. And at Pfizer, executives realized that the agency was unlikely to authorize its vaccine on the basis of so few COVID-19 cases among its clinical trial volunteers.They decided to wait for more data, a delay of up to a week.When Pfizer announced on Nov. 9 -- two days after Biden clinched his victory -- that its vaccine was a stunning success, Trump was furious. He lashed out at the company, Hahn and the FDA, accusing "deep state regulators" of conspiring with Pfizer to slow approval until after the election.The president\'s frustration with the pace of regulatory action would continue into December, as the FDA went through a time-consuming process of evaluating Pfizer\'s data and then that of a second vaccine maker, Moderna.On Dec. 11, Meadows exploded during a morning call with Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, the agency\'s top vaccine regulator. He accused Hahn of mismanagement and suggested he resign, then slammed down the phone. That night, the FDA authorized the Pfizer vaccine.In the weeks that followed, Pence, Azar, Fauci and other health officials rolled up their sleeves to be vaccinated for the cameras.Trump, who after contracting COVID-19 had declared himself immune, has not announced plans to be vaccinated.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

But according to four Democratic Hill sources, Joe Biden’s abrupt announcement of Lloyd Austin as defense secretary-designate was the sort of surprise that made Austin’s odds longer.Few on Capitol Hill this week – with the likely exception of Democratic kingmaker Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina – were expecting Austin’s nomination. As The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday, Biden didn’t tell the Senate Armed Services Committee that he needed it to move forward with a legal waiver for Austin, who is three years short of the seven years that the law requires officers to have retired from military service before serving as defense secretary.Now Biden’s Democratic allies on the Hill, many of whom rejected such a waiver in 2017 for former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to serve, are in the uncomfortable position of eroding an institutional safeguard ensuring civilian control of the military on behalf of a figure few know and fewer saw coming. One staffer for a member of the House Armed Services Committee, who did not want to be named, called the announcement a “clusterfuck.” Another Democratic aide called the situation a “hot mess.” And it is jeopardizing what should be a historic moment: the nomination of the first Black secretary of defense.A great deal of the confusion stemmed from a widespread expectation, shared by many on the Hill, that former Undersecretary of Defense Michele Flournoy was the likelier choice to run the Pentagon. In fact, Flournoy was still personally courting skeptical Democrats on the Hill just days before the Austin news broke, according to a Democratic aide. Not to mention, many of the Democratic Party’s bench of defense experts, from whom Austin is likely to staff his Pentagon should he get that far, are Flournoy’s proteges and loyalists.And if all that wasn’t enough, Austin has taken criticism this week in national-security circles for his roles, as commanding general in Iraq and then U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), in both the U.S. withdrawal in 2011 and the subsequent collapse of the Iraqi army in 2014 to ISIS. That likely foreshadows a confirmation hearing that portrays Austin, rather than the politicians who pushed a disastrous war, as the architect of failure in Iraq. That prospect is starting to prompt pushback from Austin’s former colleagues in uniform, who worry that Austin is being set up to take the fall for efforts that were doomed by factors larger than him.Pentagon: Russia Bounty Intelligence Didn’t Come From Us“There’s a lot of U.S. fingerprints on what went wrong with the ISF,” said retired Army Lt. Gen. Dan Bolger, who led the 1st Cavalry Division in Iraq during Austin’s command, using an acronym for the Iraqi military.“To point the finger at Lloyd Austin, look, David Petraeus set up [the training command for the Iraqi army], followed by Marty Dempsey, followed by Jim Dubik – a lot of us had our fingers in that pie,” Bolger continued, ticking off the succession of generals, including himself, with responsibility for building a durable Iraqi military. “Proximity does not equal responsibility. The screw-up of the Iraq campaign, we all had a hand in that.”Rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers working on military issues had an inkling that Austin was in the mix for the job, but it appears the Biden team gave little in the way of a heads-up once the decision was made. Several lawmakers only found out about the move when Politico reported that Biden had selected Austin.House Armed Services Committee member Rep. Andy Kim (D-NJ), a former counter-ISIS adviser in the Obama White House who worked closely with Austin, supports Austin’s nomination and intends to vote for the waiver. The first-term congressman told The Daily Beast on Wednesday he got no advance indication that Austin was chosen, though made clear that he didn’t expect any specific kind of warning from the transition on the nominee or the circumstances of the nod.But Kim added that the president-elect’s team needs to be aggressive in reaching out to lawmakers to make the case that a waiver for the retired general is necessary to achieve Biden’s vision. “That engagement was happening. It needs to continue,” said Kim. “I know a lot of my colleagues might not have had the personal experience and time working alongside Gen. Austin that I have, and they may want to get to know him better.”In 2017, 17 Democrats in the Senate and 150 Democrats in the House voted against the waiver for Mattis. Some in that group, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), are signaling now they’ll approve one for Austin. But other prominent voices within the party on military matters have made clear that they cannot.In a Wednesday interview on MSNBC, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) praised Austin as an “excellent choice.” But, she added, "I will not vote for the waiver. I believe very strongly there needs to be civilian control, civilian oversight of the military."One of the country’s foremost experts on civilian control of the military, Richard Kohn of the University of North Carolina, expressed concern over nominating Austin – with whom Kohn was not particularly familiar – on principle.“You can’t have civilian control unless you have a civilian in charge. Someone who spent a career in the military, rising in the ranks, is not a civilian, no matter what kind of clothing he or she wears,” Kohn said. “And it’s ironic: there’s a strong paragraph about civil-military relations and civilian control in the Democratic party platform this past year, and the president-elect spoke about it passionately this afternoon.”The general’s allies on Capitol Hill believe that he may be able to convince lawmakers to take such a step by proactively engaging with them. Austin is expected to appear for questions before the Senate and House Armed Services panels prior to any waiver vote—a step that Mattis notably did not take.Asked if Austin has an uphill climb to the Pentagon, Kim said, “I hope not.”“From what I’ve seen so far, I don\'t see that being the case yet,” he said. “But like I said, it\'s still early, and I hope that he does get the support I think he deserves right now.”A transition official, speaking with The Daily Beast on background, was adamant that Biden’s team has been “engaging widely” with individual House and Senate members and with House and Senate committees regarding Austin’s nomination—and the waiver needed to make his confirmation a reality—adding that the transition had already engaged with more than 100 congressional offices as of Tuesday evening.“Secretary-designate Austin is looking forward to speaking with Congressional leadership early on,” the official said. “He appreciates Congress’ role in considering this waiver, and looks forward to sharing more about his long history of service and his leadership vision for this new assignment as part of a diverse Cabinet executing the Biden-Harris administration’s security agenda.”The official brushed off past Democratic criticism—and the Democratic Party platform adopted during this year’s convention, in which the party called for a reaffirmation of civilian oversight of the military—by emphasizing the importance of Austin’s “deep experience with every level of the U.S. military” to setting the Pentagon “back on track.”But Biden, clearly sensing that the waiver was not a fait accompli, urged Congress to grant it in remarks announcing Austin’s nomination on Wednesday afternoon, deeming the waiver critical to address “the urgent threats and challenges our nation faces.”“Just as they did for Secretary Jim Mattis, I ask that Congress grant a waiver to Secretary-designate Austin,” Biden said, speaking in Wilmington, brandishing Austin’s résumé as proof that “we need” his experience in the military in order to, among other things, distribute the coronavirus vaccine, diversify the armed forces, strengthen America’s alliances abroad and “deter threats wherever they arise.”Bolger, who has known Austin since Austin was a captain, described him as a subdued figure, a contrast with the “outsized personalities” of many recently retired generals, who has “a very level head” in the midst of chaos.“General Austin was never about Lloyd Austin. He was about the mission and the soldiers that worked for him,” Bolger said. “He has a strong character and that’ll get him through in this secretary of defense role, because that’s a tough role.”But that only underscores that Austin held command during both a highly controversial terminal phase of the Iraq war, in 2011, and the disasters in 2014 that fatefully prompted Barack Obama to return, by degree, U.S. forces to a country they have yet to leave.At that time, many in the military did not want to pull out of Iraq despite the horrors of the occupation and the landslide election of a president who campaigned on withdrawal. Austin was one of them. As commander in 2011, he argued for a substantial residual force – something opposite the desires of the White House. The Iraqi parliament’s opposition to Austin’s desired residual force settled the issue.But what happened three years later reopened it. While Austin ran CENTCOM, the so-called Islamic State conquered Mosul, Iraq’s second city, while the U.S. backed Iraqi army there fled instead of fighting. A significant driver of a spectacular failure was the Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, who purged Sunni officers from the army in a campaign of sectarian retribution. Biden, who was Obama’s Iraq troubleshooter, saw little alternative to working with Maliki. (Tony Blinken, now Biden’s pick for secretary of state, told The Daily Beast last year that Maliki’s sectarianism occurred “not for want of us trying, and berating, and arguing, pushing, and pulling and prodding.”) With ISIS marching south, Obama resumed the Iraq war, leaving Austin to cobble together a response that could revive the Iraqi military and push ISIS back without a major U.S. military commitment.He and Dempsey, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, opted for a strategy known as “By With And Through.” It emphasized American airpower and mostly non-American ground forces. At times, that meant choosing not to fight ISIS. In October 2014, with ISIS assaulting Syrian Kurdish forces in Kobane, Austin portrayed eastern Syria as a peripheral battlefield. “Iraq is our main effort, and it has to be, and the things that we’re doing right now in Syria are being done primarily to shape the conditions in Iraq,” he told reporters.Whatever successes By With And Through yielded for the fall of the Caliphate occurred after Austin retired in 2016. The tail end of Austin’s time at CENTCOM had more embarrassments, like the February 2016 fall of Ramadi to ISIS, than victories. Most publicly, Austin confessed to Congress that a plan to cobble together a Sunni Arab army had failed after a year and half a billion dollars. Former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, in a 2017 monograph, described Austin and his colleagues as lacking a “comprehensive, achievable plan for success” that necessitated a “massive reorganization in the planning, execution, and communication about the counter-ISIS campaign.”Blaming Austin for all that, according to Bolger, fits into an American tendency to see Iraqis as bystanders to their own politics and to overattribute outcomes to generals instead of the structures in which they operate. Austin “reacted as quickly as anyone could. It took six to eight months to get a grip on how dangerous ISIS was. Even President Obama first said [ISIS] was a jay-vee squad,” said Bolger, who compared Austin to the post-William Westmoreland commander in Vietnam, an earlier doomed war.“We didn’t understand the Sunni anger in Iraq at being cut out of the post-American settlement,” Bolger said. “Gen. Austin, in my mind, he’s right up there with Gen. [Creighton] Abrams. He held together a bad situation and did the best he could with a bad war.”Kim, the ISIS specialist-turned-congressman, said he spent “countless hours in the situation room” with Austin and then-Vice President Biden. Asked about Bolger’s take, Kim said that “Gen. Austin knew the importance of pairing our military support with a political strategy to get the Iraqi government to engage with Sunni populations as well as an effort to reconstitute the Iraqi military to be the main force to counter ISIS. He spearheaded a military effort that brought together a global coalition to deliver results.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'bc0c69e6ef6c325a5f34ca3088665e51', 'title': 'The Constitution has an answer for seditious members of Congress', 'description': 'Let\'s review two pieces of news from the last week. First, the American coronavirus pandemic is entering its worst stage yet, with cases and deaths skyrocketing across the country. Last Thursday saw over 3,000 deaths — more than 9/11 or Pearl Harbor — and with ICU beds at or near capacity in most of the country, absent serious change it is possible there will be double or even triple that number per day in a matter of weeks. We may yet top the deadliest day in American history, the Galveston hurricane of 1900 that killed an estimated 8,000 people, very soon. President Trump is doing precisely nothing about this.Second, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is under investigation for bribery and abuse of office, filed a baldly seditious lawsuit calling for the Supreme Court to overturn the election results in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and hand their electoral votes to Trump. It was flatly an attempt to overturn the 2020 election, end constitutional government, and install Trump in power. Before the Supreme Court threw the suit out Friday night, 17 other Republican state attorneys general had joined him, along with 126 members of the Republican caucus in the House, while Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has agreed to represent Trump. And this is just one of dozens of attempts that Republicans at all levels of government have concocted to overturn Trump\'s loss.In short, material conditions in this country have not been this bad since 1932 at least, and the political situation has not been this bad since 1860. The logical endgame of the rapidly-accelerating Republican attempt to destroy democracy while the country burns would be civil war — if it weren\'t for the high probability that Democratic leaders would be too cowardly to fight.But it\'s worth thinking about what a party seriously committed to preserving democracy would do when faced with a seditious opposition party — namely, cut them out of power and force them to behave. Democrats could declare all traitors ineligible to serve in national office, convene a Patriot Congress composed solely of people who have not committed insurrection against the American government, and use that power to re-entrench democracy.The reasoning here is very simple. All members of Congress swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, which establishes a republican form of government. The whole point of a republic is that contests for power are conducted through a framework of rules and democratic elections, where all parties agree to respect the result whether they lose or win. Moreover, the premise of this lawsuit was completely preposterous — arguing in effect that states should not be allowed to set their own election rules if that means more Democrats can vote — and provides no evidence whatsoever for false allegations of tens of thousands of instances of voter fraud. Indeed, several of the representatives who support the lawsuit were themselves just elected by the very votes they now say are fraudulent. The proposed remedy — having Republican-dominated legislatures in only the four states that gave Biden his margin of victory select Trump electors — would be straight-up election theft.In other words, this lawsuit, even though it didn\'t succeed, is a flagrant attempt to overturn the constitutional system and impose through authoritarian means the rule of a corrupt criminal whose doltish incompetence has gotten hundreds of thousands of Americans killed. It is a "seditious abuse of the judicial process," as the states of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin jointly wrote in their response to Texas trying to steal their elections.The Constitution, as goofy and jerry-rigged as it is, stipulates that insurrectionists who violate their oath are not allowed to serve in Congress. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, written to exclude Confederate Civil War traitors, says that "No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress … who … having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same[.]" How the Supreme Court ruled, or whether Republicans actually believe their lunatic claims, is irrelevant. It\'s still insurrection even if it doesn\'t work out.Democrats would have every right, both under the Constitution and under the principle of popular sovereignty outlined in the Declaration of Independence, to convene a traitor-free Congress (also including similar acts committed by Republican senators like Lindsey Graham, David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler, and others), and pass such laws as would be necessary to preserve the American republic. That might include a national popular vote to decide the presidency, ironclad voting rights protections, a ban on gerrymandering either national or state district boundaries, full representation for the citizens of D.C. and Puerto Rico, regulations on internet platforms that are inflaming violent political extremism, a clear legal framework for the transfer of power that ends the lame duck period, and so on. States would be forced to agree to these measures before they can replace their traitorous representatives and senators. If the Supreme Court objects, more pro-democracy justices can be added.This wouldn\'t be the first time such a thing has happened, either. Immediately after the Civil War, the Radical Republican Congress refused to seat delegations from the former rebellious states until they were satisfied with the progress of Reconstruction. Southern states were forced to ratify the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments — which guaranteed due process and universal male suffrage — before their congressional delegations would be seated. (As a consequence, those delegations included numerous Black representatives, until Reconstruction was overthrown.)It is virtually impossible to imagine the ancient, timid fossils that run the Democratic Party even considering this kind of thing (though remarkably, Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey has) because it would require courage, vision, and honestly reckoning with the parlous state of the nation. It would not be illegal, but it would be a step beyond narrow legal proceduralism and into the uncharted waters of aggressive political innovation and raw will-to-power. It could conceivably touch off armed unrest in several states.But it\'s not hard to see where the current conservative trajectory is headed. While elected Republicans have tried to overturn the election using increasingly blatant methods, top conservative pundits are mulling the idea of secession, as their treasonous fire-eater forebears did 160 years ago. The lie that Biden stole the election is now official GOP dogma. By the same token, it is not a coincidence that the Republican Party is ignoring the deadly pandemic (if not actively spreading the virus) while they try to overturn the Constitution. They feel they can safely ignore the welfare of the American people, because they are not accountable to them.Unless this escalating conservative extremism halts from the inside somehow — which is not remotely in sight anywhere — this can only end eventually in a violent confrontation, or (much more likely) Democrats will simply give up and let themselves be defeated. Still, this country was founded by people who thought it was worth putting their lives at hazard to throw off tyrannical rule. Perhaps some of that spirit can once again be found.More stories from theweek.com  Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms reportedly went from Biden\'s VP list to being offered a Bahamas ambassadorship  Joe Biden\'s agriculture appointment is a slap in the face to Black voters  FDA authorizes emergency use for Pfizer vaccine', 'num_of_covid': 1}

More than three-quarters of his wealth is comprised of Tesla shares, which have grown a massive 523.7% year-to-date.Bloomberg also noted that Gates' ranking would have been higher had he not donated more than $27 billion to his foundation since 2006. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos is still the world's richest with a fortune of $182 billion.Why It Matters: Though this year has been good for Tesla's stock, it can get even better in 2021. Tesla stands to gain from its inclusion in the S&P 500 index. On one side, the EV maker has been a target for short sellers, but on the other, it has also received 8 and $1,000 price targets by analysts.Price Action: TSLA shares are trading higher by 2.92% to $537.11 in the pre-market session on the last check Tuesday.Image Courtesy: WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Tesla Rolls Out Firmware Update After Hacker Discovers Model X Security Flaw  * Positive Vaccine News, Economic Recovery Lift Global Markets(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

According to Maccabi, an Israeli healthcare provider, only 31 out of 163,000 Israelis developed coronavirus once the Pfizer vaccine had fully taken effect. “This is very, very good news,” Anat Ekka Zohar, Maccabi’s lead vaccines analyst, told the Times of Israel. “It is the first study in the world that looks at such a large number of fully vaccinated patients.” A control sample of the same size, with unvaccinated Israelis, found that more than 6,437 people caught the disease during the same timeframe. A similar study by Maccabi released earlier this week also reported a substantially high rate of protection after the second jab. “It’s a very high level of efficiency and we are seeing a very low percentage of coronavirus among the patients who have taken both shots,” Ms Ekka Zohar said, referring to the latest data. Israel, the world’s fastest vaccinator against Covid, has already given the first of two jabs to nearly a third of its population. Patients with underlying health conditions and the over-35s are taking priority, but this week 16 to 18-year-olds have also been included so they can sit important winter exams.

Zervos accused Trump of sexually assaulting her on two occasions, forcibly kissing and groping her. In 2017, Zervos filed the defamation lawsuit after Trump accused her of lying. His lawyers argued that because he was president, he had immunity, and the case was put on hold in January 2020. In a statement, Zervos\' lawyer, Beth Wilkinson, said that since Trump is "now a private citizen," he "has no further excuse to delay justice for Ms. Zervos, and we are eager to get back to the trial court and prove her claims." Zervos and her legal team are hoping that Trump will be compelled to testify under oath about her allegations. Trump is also facing criminal investigations and a second defamation suit, filed by writer E. Jean Carroll. Carroll accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s at a department store in Manhattan, and in 2019, she sued him for defamation after he publicly denied the claims.

{'_id': '831bf3756817f0c546a55aeadaeefd66', 'title': 'Florida Is a COVID Nightmare—Even for Vaccinated People', 'description': 'Octavio Jones/GettyMIAMI—By the end of next week, Nancy Krinick expects to get her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. But the 67-year-old legal secretary from Sunrise, Florida, plans on keeping her daily routine of avoiding virtually all human contact even after she’s fully inoculated. The same goes for her sister and her brother-in-law, both of whom are over 65 and got their first shots together with her at Marlins Park in Miami, Krinick told The Daily Beast.“With these new variants, we are still worried,” she said, adding, “It seems like this is never ending.”She will continue to get her groceries delivered to her home via Instacart, avoid dining out, and put off visiting her daughter in Knoxsville, Tennessee, until a majority of the U.S. population has been immunized, Krinick said.As extra-contagious mutations of the coronavirus gather strength like a hurricane churning off the Atlantic coast, Floridians like Krinick see no sign of respite. While they have yet to issue formal guidance on congregating by vaccinated people, state and national health experts have assured the general public that the vaccines are effective—even, if perhaps less so, against the variants surging nationwide.But in a state with a long history of pandemic recklessness and where mask mandates are nonexistent, vaccinated Floridians don’t want to risk getting infected by going out in public.Here, getting a shot offers little more than a modicum of relief.Deadly COVID Mutations Can’t Stop the Party in FloridaThanks to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ongoing approach of forcing his state to be wide-open for business and pleasure, surges in community spread seem virtually inevitable. Last weekend, despite warnings from state epidemiologists, a host of potential super-spreader events took Tampa by storm, punctuated by legions of Buccaneers fans, a majority of them maskless, celebrating the home town’s victory when the Super Bowl wrapped up.“Everytime I see super-spreader events like that, yes it does scare me,” said Mark Zeitlin, a 70-year-old from Boynton Beach, Florida, who’s gotten both his shots. “It’s not only Tampa. It’s happening everywhere.”Glenn Charnizon, a 66-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, who also got both doses, said he and his wife won’t be dining out, traveling, or going to the grocery store for a “long, long time.”“Just because we got vaccinated doesn’t mean we can’t get COVID,” Charinzon said. “We’re not taking any chances until 70 to 80 percent of the population is vaccinated.”Meanwhile, the Biden White House is reportedly considering new restrictions on domestic travel with huge implications in Florida, which accounts for more than a third of all documented U.S. cases of the B-117 variant, also known as the highly contagious U.K. variant. Researchers are also monitoring for any Florida outbreaks of other variants from Brazil and South Africa that have been found elsewhere in the United States, but not—officially—in the Sunshine State.DeSantis’ response has been to chastise reporters for allegedly downplaying the coronavirus dangers of social-justice protests and celebrations of Biden’s electoral victory over Donald Trump, striking a defiant tone regarding any travel restrictions. At a Thursday press conference, DeSantis said, “We will oppose it 100 percent. It would not be based in science. It would purely be a political attack against the people of Florida.” A spokesperson for the governor’s office did not respond to email requests for comment.Seniors who spoke to The Daily Beast said DeSantis has been deliberately obtuse in what passes here for containing the pandemic. “The governor of this state is out of control,” said Charnizon. Krinick, the legal secretary, added: “DeSantis? Not a fan. I don’t think he’s doing anything.”To be sure, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, recently said getting both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to stay ahead of the new mutant variants. And Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, a Florida International University infectious disease professor, told The Daily Beast that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly effective in preventing people from getting sick—including when it came to the U.K. variant.Still, given the basic limitations of any vaccine, and the proliferation of variant cases in a state that has stood out for pandemic absurdity, Floridians can’t let up any time soon.“It is possible people who have gotten their second dose can still catch the virus,” Trepka said. “They can be asymptomatic and become infectious. But we are very concerned about more variants popping up because we may get one that vaccines don’t work on.”‘No One Is Thinking About COVID’: Get Ready for Super Bowl SuperspreadersDue to the high degree of community spread in Florida, vaccines alone will not end the pandemic, she argued—even if the shots have amounted to DeSantis’ sole strategy of late.“Even if you are one of those who have gotten full doses, you are still around a lot of people who have not been vaccinated,” she said. “We need people wearing masks, doing physical distance, and avoiding large crowds. Many people are following it religiously and many are not.”The fear and anger at the dangers posed even after vaccination are not confined to the senior citizens DeSantis has prioritized above virtually all others. In the labor and delivery department of North Miami’s Northshore Medical Center, health-care workers who have been fully inoculated are still on guard, said one nurse who asked for anonymity because she did not have authorization from the hospital to speak to the media.“Because of the new variants and people not being safe, I am still wearing a mask when I go out and I am still not going to family functions because I know I can’t trust some family members who are out in the streets and not taking proper precautions,” she said.The terrifying reality that Florida is a living petri dish for coronavirus mutations means seniors like Carla Golembe will just keep isolating themselves even though she’s gotten both her shots.“The variants are scary,” the 67-year-old artist from Delray Beach, Florida, told The Daily Beast. “We don’t know much about them. Just when we think we are beginning to understand this virus, now there are more curveballs.”In two weeks, once her body has built up full immunity, the only major outing she has planned is a trip to her dentist, she said.“Maybe on a quiet afternoon, I will go into a grocery store, double-masked,” she said. “I hope my husband, who also got both his shots, and I can get together with other friends who have been fully vaccinated. We want to hang out again, but at a distance and outdoors, of course.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Biotech firm Moderna was the first to start human testing of an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus, in March. U.S. researchers reported that this early-stage study found the vaccine was safe and induced immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers. Top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci called the results 'good news.' His researchers developed Moderna's vaccine candidate and he says it produced quote 'reasonably high' levels of antibodies. Another positive outcome was the lack of serious side effects. However, more than half of the participants reported moderate restrictions like fevers, headaches and chills. The team says these were more likely to occur after a second, larger dose and in people who got the trial's highest dose. When injected into people, Moderna's vaccine instructs cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the coronavirus. The body recognizes this as a foreign invader, and mounts an immune response against it. The federal government is supporting Moderna's vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and has chosen it as one of the first to enter large-scale human trials. Moderna started its phase 2 trial in May and expects to begin a phase 3 trial at the end of this month. It will be conducted in some 30,000 volunteers.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

Manafort was sentenced to more than 7 years in prison in early 2019 after being charged with financial crimes, as well as witness tampering and unregistered lobbying, as a result of the Mueller probe. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance charged Manafort with pretty much the same financial crimes shortly after his second sentence in what was seemingly an insurance policy against Trump\'s likely pardon of Manafort. After all, a president cannot pardon someone charged with state crimes. But the overlap turned out to work against Vance. In December 2019, New York state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley threw out the state\'s charges, saying that "the law of double jeopardy in New York State provides a very narrow window for prosecution." Vance took the case to the New York Court of Appeals — the state\'s highest court — but it said last week that it had declined to review the case. As a result, Wiley\'s ruling will stand. Trump did end up pardoning Manafort in December, though he was already serving his sentence at home due to COVID-19 concerns. Manafort had pleaded not guilty to the New York charges, and his lawyer told The New York Times he is pleased with the result. Manafort could still be charged with other federal or state crimes.

Tim Griffin (R) has reportedly had his hopes set on the state\'s governorship for a long time, even leaving Congress to pursue that goal, and he officially declared his candidacy for the job, which is opening up in 2022, back in August. But on Monday, he announced he\'s bowing out and will instead seek to become Arkansas\' next attorney general. In a statement, Griffin said he believes "I can do more for Arkansas" in that capacity, but the early reactions from analysts are that Griffin likely came to the realization that his prospects of defeating former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who launched her campaign just two weeks ago, in a GOP primary were slim. The race, for the moment, is down to Sanders and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, another prominent Republican in the state. But the fact that Sanders\' name recognition — she\'s both an ally of former President Donald Trump and the daughter of former Arkansas Gov.

{'_id': 'd090addbcefe7182d30a255f7b6db5aa', 'title': 'What Donald Trump Liked About Being President', 'description': 'In November 2018, after a vote that did not matter enough to him to push conspiracy theories about the outcome, President Donald Trump stood in the Rose Garden and delivered the hard truth."This was a fair election," he said to a bird named Carrots, sidelined at the annual White House turkey pardon after being snubbed in an online contest over which privileged poultry (Peas or Carrots) would star in the ritual. "Unfortunately, Carrots refused to concede and demanded a recount, and we\'re still fighting with Carrots."Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe crowd laughed, and Trump smirked a little. Such hammy pageantry in stately settings, aides say, has long been a part of the job he especially enjoys. He gripped his lectern for the punchline, thumbs behind the presidential seal."We\'ve come to a conclusion," Trump said grandly. "Carrots, I\'m sorry to tell you, the result did not change. It\'s too bad for Carrots."Two years later, after an election result that was too bad for Trump, he has been less willing to accept the cold math of whom the people want to see at the White House.In the weeks since Election Day, the president and his allies have set off on a groundless and dangerous effort to overturn the will of an electorate that rejected him, moving to undercut basic tenets of American democracy to cling to an office he did not expect to win four years ago and has not particularly treasured since, by most accounts.On Monday, after the administrator of the General Services Administration formally designated President-elect Joe Biden as the apparent winner of the election, Trump blessed the move on Twitter while still vowing to move ahead with legal challenges.Yet the president\'s desperate gambit until this point has been so all-consuming, his aversion to losing so well known, that little attention has been paid to a knotty question underpinning it all: What, exactly, was he holding onto? Why fight so hard, and put the country through so much, to keep a position he has often not appeared to want?In some ways, Trump had seemed to imagine his Washington life more closely resembling a rolling turkey pardon -- the pomp and splendor, yes, but also a world largely amenable to his boss-man bearing and binary whims: This bird is spared. Those birds are not. He\'d have his people call the turkey people and hammer out the fine print later. But through it all, his word would be final.This instinct has likewise fueled Trump\'s affection for people-pardoning: He has used his pardon and clemency powers with abandon to reward allies and others whose causes are backed by celebrities. He is still considering a wave of such pardons for the final weeks of his tenure.But for Trump, the more consistent reality of the presidency, laced with briefings and congressional obstacles and impeachment and criticism, has never quite measured up.He has generally relished the aspects of the job that allow him to preside over something, fowl-based or otherwise -- forums well-suited to a leader for whom attention can seem less a wish than a psychic need.The trappings and the title have plainly pleased him the most, placing him at the center of major celebrations for the mere fact of being president. He has marveled at the Bastille Day parade in Paris, taken to the "beautiful phones" at the White House and delighted in serving fast food to college football champions. In July, Trump, who has for years pressed the federal government to stage an elaborate fireworks display at Mount Rushmore, finally got his way.He has also amused himself showing off Air Force One and the Lincoln Bedroom. Then there is the study off the Oval Office, which he converted into a small dining room -- the space, he has informed guests with a twinkle, where Monica Lewinsky would visit President Bill Clinton.Jeff Flake, a Republican former senator from Arizona who spoke forcefully against Trump before leaving office, recalled Trump\'s manifest glee at posing for pictures in his workspace."He loves having people go into the Oval Office -- him sitting with a thumbs-up and for them to stand," he said. "He seemed to never tire of that, of showing people the Oval Office and getting that picture."The president\'s furious bid to keep power, Flake suggested, reflected Trump\'s realization that his future celebrity might never match the present. "No matter how much fame he had before, it didn\'t compare," he said. "Once he had it, it\'s tough to give up."Certainly Trump\'s predecessors have appreciated many perks of the post, holding court with favored entertainers or athletes at the White House and growing fond of their privileged temporary address. But this president has taken a more conspicuous shine to such advantages than most.It is little secret that the mechanics of government never much animated Trump. He has been on most sides of most major political issues throughout his adult life, depending on the day. His reelection campaign barely bothered with a detailed vision for a prospective second term, focusing far more often on cultural grievance and race-baiting rally fare.While he has effectively abdicated any leadership role in steering the nation\'s coronavirus response -- generally processing its devastation this year through the lens of how the pandemic would affect him politically -- the president plans to see to it that the turkey pardon proceeds as scheduled Tuesday.It stands to be one of his few public appearances in recent weeks amid runaway virus case numbers and his continued assault on the integrity of the election. Trump has maintained a light public schedule since Nov. 3 and has often seemed downcast at his handful of engagements, including an announcement about the push to develop coronavirus vaccines, which he had promoted aggressively during the campaign.Besides his regular golf outings on the weekends, the man who has historically seemed to need human interaction for sustenance -- the audience for his perpetual show -- is demonstrating little interest in being around others when he cannot point to something he can credibly call a win.But then, the image of Trump merrily addressing turkeys in this context might register as a fitting turn for an executive end-stage that has constantly commingled calamity and absurdity.It is also something of a culmination after three years of turkey pardons that have at times doubled as surprisingly telling snapshots of Trump\'s frame of mind at various points in his presidency, with cutting asides and easy smiles in equal measure."From what I\'ve seen," said Beth Breeding, a spokesperson for the National Turkey Federation, "the president seems to have really enjoyed them."At the event in 2017, as Trump was working to reverse as much of the Obama legacy as he could, he joked that the White House Counsel\'s Office had reminded him that the former president\'s turkey pardons could not be revoked.In 2018, with congressional investigations looming as Democrats prepared to take control of the House, the president said he had warned Peas and Carrots that "House Democrats are likely to issue them both subpoenas" despite his clemency.And in 2019, as an impeachment inquiry and the upcoming election weighed on him, Trump opened with a bit of self-congratulation ("it\'s always nice to begin by saying the stock market is up again"), allowed his mind to wander to the emotional comforts of his victory in 2016 ("very great day") and complained bitterly about Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee.By the end, though, the president was fulfilling the part of the job that always made the most sense to him: master of ceremonies. He placed his hand over a turkey named Butter, used the word "hereby" to infuse the proceedings with requisite gravitas ("I hereby grant you a full and complete pardon") and started clapping on his way back inside."That was great," Trump said, watching the crowd watch him. "Lot of fun."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

BIDEN: “We\'ve had 4000 deaths, 4000 deaths yesterday, and things continue to rise, to escalate. That\'s my number one concern, to get the virus under control. // I\'m committed. To get 100 million shots in people\'s arms in the first 100 days.” The U.S. vaccine rollout has begun slowly as hospitals have not been able to administer the shots as quickly as they received them. The monumental effort has fallen far short of the goal of getting 20 million people vaccinated that the Trump Administration had vowed to reach by the end of 2020. J Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden\'s transition, told Reuters QUOTE: "The President-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible." The announcement marked a departure from the Trump administration’s strategy of holding back a supply to ensure required second doses of the vaccines are available.  Manufacturing would have to be consistent enough to supply those second doses on schedule - three or four weeks after the first. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Thursday, roughly 6 million people across the United States had received a first injection of the vaccines - less than one-third of more than 21 million doses shipped to date. The pandemic showed no sign of abating this week, claiming the lives of more than 4,000 people across the country for the second consecutive day on Thursday. This, as the White House coronavirus task force said there could be a new variant of the virus that evolved in the United States and is driving spread, according to reports by CNBC.

She Credits Gin-Soaked Raisins.', 'description': 'Ask Lucia DeClerck how she has lived to be 105, and she is quick with an answer. “Prayer. Prayer. Prayer,” she offers. “One step at a time. No junk food.” But surviving the coronavirus, she said, also may have had something to do with another staple: the nine gin-soaked golden raisins she has eaten each morning for most of her life. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “Fill a jar,” she explained. “Nine raisins a day after it sits for nine days.” Her children and grandchildren recall the ritual as just one of DeClerck’s endearing lifelong habits, like drinking aloe juice straight from the container and brushing her teeth with baking soda. (That worked, too: She did not have a cavity until she was 99, relatives said.) “We would just think, ‘Grandma, what are you doing? You’re crazy,’” said her 53-year-old granddaughter, Shawn Laws O’Neil, of Los Angeles. “Now the laugh is on us. She has beaten everything that’s come her way.” It is a long list. Born in 1916 in Hawaii to parents who came from Guatemala and Spain, she lived through the Spanish flu, two world wars and the deaths of three husbands and a son. She moved to Wyoming, California and back to Hawaii before finally arriving in New Jersey, where she lived with her oldest son. After turning 90, she moved to an adult community in Manahawkin, New Jersey, along the Jersey Shore, where she remained active until she injured herself in a fall about four years ago. “She is just the epitome of perseverance,” O’Neil said. “Her mind is so sharp. She will remember things when I was a kid that I don’t even remember.” DeClerck, the oldest resident of her South Jersey nursing home, learned that she had contracted the virus on her 105th birthday, Jan. 25, the day after she had gotten her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to Michael Neiman, the home’s administrator. At first, she said she was scared. She did not like being isolated, and she missed the daily chatter from the parade of caregivers at Mystic Meadows Rehabilitation and Nursing, a 120-bed facility in Little Egg Harbor. She showed few symptoms, Neiman said. And within two weeks she was back in her room, holding her rosary beads and wearing her trademark sunglasses and knit hat. To her two surviving sons, five grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great grandchildren, who call her Grandma Lucia, she has a new moniker, O’Neil said: “The 105-year-old badass who kicked COVID.” On Monday, she got a shout-out from Gov. Phil Murphy, who described a phone call with her during a coronavirus news briefing. “What an uplifting conversation,” the governor said. DeClerck’s family gathered in January 2020 at Mystic Meadows to celebrate her 104th birthday before the onset of the pandemic. When they learned that she had contracted the virus, they braced for the worst. “We were very concerned,” her son, Phillip Laws, 78, said. “But she’s got a tenacity that is unbelievable,” he added. “And she’s got that rosary — all the time.” A devout Catholic, DeClerck led rosary prayers each week at the nursing home and, before the pandemic, was a fixture at weekly Mass. She raised three sons and ran a corner store for decades with her first husband, Henry Laws Jr., in Los Angeles. She married twice more after returning to Hawaii, where she worked as a home health aide and welcomed grandchildren for summerlong visits. DeClerck is one of 62 residents of Mystic Meadows to have contracted the virus; four patients died, including three who were receiving hospice care, Neiman said. “We’re as careful as possible,” he said, “but this finds a way of sneaking in.” In January, residents were being tested twice a week, and a rapid test in the last week of the month showed that DeClerck had contracted the virus. “At first she was a little apprehensive, a little scared, but she said, ‘God will protect me,’” Neiman said. She had also been vaccinated, which most likely contributed to her recovery. The first studies of Britain’s mass inoculation program showed strong evidence Monday that even one dose of vaccine can help slash coronavirus-related hospitalizations. DeClerck is not the oldest person to beat the virus. Europe’s oldest-known resident, Sister André, contracted the virus at 116. She celebrated with a glass of Champagne on her 117th birthday earlier this month at a nursing home in Toulon, a city in southeastern France. Like Sister André, DeClerck may be ready for a toast. But it is likely to involve gin and a handful of golden raisins. Her family is following suit. “Now all of us are rushing out and getting Mason jars and yellow raisins and trying to catch up,” O’Neil said.

{'_id': '57c48679b1c6f08b64bae302baf4fb85', 'title': 'Pentagon Nixed Request to Give COVID Vaccine to National Guard Before Inauguration', 'description': 'Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via GettySenior Pentagon officials denied an early December request to vaccinate the National Guard troops tapped to secure Washington during the inauguration, according to two officials familiar with the matter.Those sources said the request, made by officials in charge of planning the event, was rejected because most of the guardsmen called to help protect the inauguration fell outside of the first tier of the Department of Defense’s population schema for the COVID-19 vaccine. Despite the rebuff, inauguration event planners continued to press the issue, raising fears about the spread of the virus within the Capitol campus and among attendees, particularly if protesters at the event did not wear masks, officials said.One individual involved with the planning said senior officials at the Pentagon pushed back against the vaccination idea primarily because they were worried about muddling the department’s prescribed vaccination playbook—that the process would divert doses away from those in the first wave of distribution. Now National Guard spokespeople say they don’t know how many of the guardsmen have been vaccinated. Another official familiar with the matter, however, said some troops did receive their first shot when they showed up for duty at the Capitol. Meanwhile, dozens of National Guard troops working to help protect the inauguration have tested positive for the virus, according to a report by the Military Times.“What we are doing is screening incoming Guard men and women according to CDC guidelines. This was done upon departure from their individual states and upon arrival to the D.C. Armory,” one National Guard spokesperson told The Daily Beast, adding that temperature checks and screening questions are in place and that masks and social distancing are required “where the mission allows.”“It’s ridiculous that we’re asking these troops to come in and protect people, and we’re not making sure they’re protected themselves,” said one U.S. official helping with the inauguration planning. “This shouldn’t have happened.”The decision not to vaccinate the National Guard troops before their arrival at the Capitol underscores the extent to which the federal government, as well as states across the country, has struggled to navigate the intricate COVID-19 vaccine distribution process and scale immunization.Days after the initial doses were shipped by Pfizer in the second week of December, states reported receiving less vaccine doses than anticipated. Officials working with Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to fast-track a vaccine, rebuffed the states’ concerns, saying a slight shift in the allocation schedule had caused a minor delay but that more vaccine doses were on the way. As the weeks rolled by, vaccination rates remained low throughout the U.S., including within the Department of Defense.One official familiar with the Pentagon’s distribution said Walter Reed Medical Center, in particular, lagged in administering the doses it had received in the first several weeks of the vaccine rollout. And experts began to worry about the national vaccination rate, emphasizing that something needed to be done quickly to scale not just distribution but also immunization.In the initial days of the vaccine distribution, state officials—and officials within the Pentagon— closely followed the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control that detailed how officials should go about doling out doses, including who should receive the vaccine first. It wasn’t until earlier this month, after vaccine rates stalled, that the federal government began to discuss redefining the CDC’s guidelines in an effort to push states to distribute the vaccine more freely.In the first week of January, as The Daily Beast previously reported, officials working on the vaccine and its distribution met at Camp David to discuss the importance of scaling vaccination nationwide more quickly. The idea was to tell states to hand out doses that were set to expire on the shelf to anyone who wanted them even if they fell outside the first recommended CDC wave.Then, a week later, on Jan. 12, the federal government, in tandem with the Biden COVID-19 team, told states to open up the vaccines to everyone in America older than age 65, as well as anyone younger who has a pre-existing condition that could make them more vulnerable to the coronavirus. On top of widening access, the government said it would no longer hold back doses for the second shot of the vaccine and that states should instead try to administer all available doses as quickly as possible.But by that time—days after the mob attacked the Capitol and less than a week before the inauguration—officials at the Pentagon determined it was too late to begin vaccinating all of the National Guard troops called up. There were simply too many of them. And even if the department began vaccinating those called up for inauguration, troops would not be protected by Jan. 20. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are administered in two doses weeks apart from one another, and experts say an individual is not protected until seven days after the second dose.The officials familiar with the conversations about vaccinating the National Guard said discussions about how to protect the troops during their time serving for the inauguration continued throughout December and January. The Pentagon finally settled on the decision to begin administering the vaccine to troops in the Capitol complex anyway, even if the doses do not protect them during the inauguration events.“The idea is to speed up vaccination,” one official working with the Pentagon’s vaccination program said. “And we have all these people in one place. It’s a perfect setting to make sure we give all of them their shots, whether that be their first or second.”The Pentagon initially approved 6,000 National Guard troops to deploy to the Capitol to help protect the inauguration. That number quickly swelled to 25,000, with troops deploying from all 50 states and three territories.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Through their explicit endorsements or complicity of silence, much of the GOP leadership now shares responsibility for the quixotic attempt to ignore the nation\'s founding principles and engineer a different verdict from the one voters cast in November.Many regular Republicans supported this effort, too -- a sign that Trump has not just bent the party to his will, but pressed a mainstay of American politics for nearly two centuries into the service of overturning an election outcome and assaulting public faith in the electoral system. The GOP sought to undo the vote by such spurious means that the Supreme Court quickly rejected the argument.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesEven some Republican leaders delivered a withering assessment of the 126 GOP House members and 18 attorneys general who chose to side with Trump over the democratic process, by backing a lawsuit that asked the Supreme Court to throw out some 20 million votes in four key states that cemented the president\'s loss."The act itself by the 126 members of the United States House of Representatives, is an affront to the country," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. "It\'s an offense to the Constitution and it leaves an indelible stain that will be hard for these 126 members to wipe off their political skin for a long time to come."Speaking on CNN on Friday, Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican, said, "What happened with the Supreme Court, that\'s kind of it, where they\'ve kind of exhausted all the legal challenges; we\'ve got to move on." It was time, he said, for Congress to "actually do something for the American people, surrounding the vaccines, surrounding COVID."With direct buy-in from senior officials like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the president\'s effort required the party to promote false theory upon unsubstantiated claim upon outright lie about unproved, widespread fraud -- in an election that Republican and Democratic election officials agreed was notably smooth given the challenges of the pandemic.And it meant that Republican leaders now stand for a new notion: that the final decisions of voters can be challenged without a basis in fact if the results are not to the liking of the losing side, running counter to decades of work by the United States to convince developing nations that peaceful transfers of power are key to any freely elected government\'s credibility."From a global perspective this certainly looks like many of the cases we\'ve seen around the world where an incumbent tries to hold onto power," said Michael Abramowitz, president of Freedom House, a Washington-based group that promotes democracy abroad with support from both parties.Though the decisions by the Supreme Court and other courts meant that in the end, American "institutions have held strong," he added, "there\'s no question that people around the world are now looking to America and it\'s really important for Americans of all parties to stand up for the rule of law and for democracy."Republicans who have resisted Trump\'s campaign agreed, predicting that the party was risking its own destruction."I keep comparing it somewhat to Jonestown," said former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, referring to the cult that ended in a tragic mass suicide. "They\'ve all drunk the Kool Aid. It just hasn\'t killed them yet."Following the court decision, one of the 126 House Republicans who backed the lawsuit, Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, said that the court\'s decision meant the end of Trump\'s efforts and "closed the books on challenges to the 2020 election results."Democrats took heart in the court\'s decision in the case filed by the Republican attorney general of Texas, one of several dozen that judges have soundly rejected on legal or factual bases, even if more lawsuits are certain to come ahead of Biden\'s inauguration on Jan. 20."Our democracy has withstood Donald Trump for four years," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees election law. "It can withstand these baseless lawsuits for four more weeks."But civil rights attorneys saw the potential for long-lasting damage outside of the legal realm where the Republican efforts -- and the lie that Biden\'s win was the result of widespread fraud -- have so definitively failed.Republican state legislators across the country are already contemplating new laws to make voting harder, as they continue to falsely portray the expansion and ease of mail-in voting during the pandemic as nefarious. Many of them view this year\'s expanded voting ranks as bad for their party, despite Republican successes further down the ballot. Their consideration of new voting restrictions amounts to an ongoing attack on the integrity of the voting system, involving still more false and debunked claims."There is an anti-democratic virus that has spread in mainstream Republicanism, among mainstream Republican elected officials," said Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU. "And that loss of faith in the machinery of democracy is a much bigger problem than any individual lawsuit."Indeed, after the Supreme Court\'s ruling, the Texas Republican Party effectively called for secession by red states whose attorneys general joined in the Texas suit."Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the Constitution," a statement from its chairman, Allen West, read. It followed an observation Rush Limbaugh made earlier in the week, when he said, "I actually think that we\'re trending toward secession."The talk of secession came during a week in which election officials across the country, from both political parties, said they had become the subjects of menacing threats of violence, including to family members, for standing by Biden\'s victory.A website of unknown provenance that caught the attention of law enforcement appeared to promote a hit list of mostly Republican officials who had resisted Trump\'s demands to overturn an election he lost, listing their personal information and imposing red cross hairs over their pictures.Trump made it clear that the Supreme Court decision would not slow a post-campaign campaign, the futility of which has dampened neither its ferocity nor its pertinacity. On Twitter, Trump on Saturday called it a "disgraceful miscarriage of justice" and wrote "WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!"Hours before the court made its decision public the Trump campaign released two ads repeating debunked allegations, indicating it would continue to pressure elected Republican officials to somehow reverse Trump\'s political fate. "Demand an honest election and an honest count, contact your legislators today," one ad exhorted. (The campaign claimed that the ads would begin airing on cable television on Saturday morning, but at least one ad tracking firm said they had not seen any reservations made as of Friday night.)There is one inescapable reality that is driving many party leaders to embrace the president\'s position, as antithetical as it is to democracy. "Donald Trump is still the 800-pound gorilla in the Republican room -- he\'s the biggest gravitational force that\'s probably ever existed in the party," said Christopher Ruddy, CEO of the conservative network Newsmax.Trump\'s popular vote tally of 74 million would have been the largest in American history had Biden not outdone him by 7 million votes. And, Ruddy noted, "Republican voters are up in arms, they feel this election was not fairly accounted for."Ruddy\'s network has something to do with that; it has gained on the behemoth of conservative television, Fox News, by heavily promoting Trump\'s voter-fraud allegations. In doing so Newsmax has helped set off a competition with Fox News\' more strident hosts, as well as those of the smaller conservative channel One America News, to give Trump and his voters what they want: A counter to the reality that Trump soon will be leaving office.Whatever their primary sources of information, Republicans overwhelmingly view the election as fatally flawed; a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday found that only 23% of registered Republican voters -- and slightly less than half of all white men who are registered to vote -- said they believed Biden\'s victory was legitimate.Those doubters do not represent a majority of Americans; 60% of registered voters overall said they accepted the results. But they form the core of the Republican base, and the party\'s leaders have proved continually unwilling to go against them -- especially with a critical runoff looming in Georgia that will determine partisan control of the Senate.Even after Trump\'s loss, catering to the wishes of Republican voters has meant aping the president\'s own paranoid style of politics by clinging to supposed examples of fraud even after they have been debunked in court.For instance, last month Graham said during an interview on "Fox & Friends" that a signature verification machine in Clark County, Nevada, which encompasses Las Vegas, was used improperly to accept "every signature whether it was fraudulent or not." In the same interview, he shared an allegation that people in the county were spotted filling out fraudulent ballots on "a Biden/Harris truck."Those allegations were contained in a lawsuit Republicans filed in the state. Last week a judge found that the signature machine in question had, in fact, sent 70% of the signatures it scanned back to election workers for human verification. "The record does not support" allegations that the machine "accepted signatures that should have been rejected," wrote the judge, James Russell. Similarly, he ruled, a witness account about false ballots filled out on a Biden/Harris vehicle was "not credible."On Friday, a spokesman for Graham declined to address those findings and said the senator "continues to have grave concerns about the expanded use of mail in ballots."In a hearing about the 2020 election in Wisconsin led by statehouse Republicans on Friday, witnesses suggested the state faced election interference from the dead dictators Hugo Chavez and Josef Stalin, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Kanye West.Some of the claims were similar to conspiracy theories contained in suits filed by a conservative lawyer, Sidney Powell, whose attempts to overturn the election results have been regularly rejected by judges. One wrote that a case she brought on behalf of Republican plaintiffs seemed to have been "more about the impact of their allegations on people\'s faith in the democratic process" as well as "trust in our government."Tom Rath, a former Republican attorney general of New Hampshire, who endorsed Biden and opposed his party\'s effort at the Supreme Court, lamented what seemed to be political incentives within his party to shake that trust. "It\'s very unfortunate," he said, "that some people tried to live off that chaos, perpetuate it and make it even more difficult for the average citizen to trust what government\'s doing."Rath, who advised the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, added, "We\'re in a very bad place as a party."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

At that point, Trump\'s internal poll numbers had reportedly taken a tumble, Swan notes.With that in mind, he reportedly called his first White House chief of staff, a stunned Reince Priebus, and "acted out his script, including walking up to a podium and prematurely declaring victory on election night if it looked like he was ahead."

Read on to see what they are—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Dr. Fauci Says the Easiest Way to Avoid COVID is to Get Vaccinated ASAP "The easiest way to evade this negative effect of these new isolates is to just when the vaccine becomes available, people should get vaccinated," says Dr. Fauci. "Boy, if ever there was a clarion call for people to put aside vaccine hesitancy. If we can get the overwhelming majority of the population vaccinated, we\'d be in very good shape and could beat even the mutant." Keep reading for four more essential tips from Fauci. 2 Dr. Fauci Says Everyone Must Wear a Mask A mask protects you from getting COVID-19 and also from spreading COVID-19, according to the CDC. Joe Biden will ask every American to wear a mask at least during the first 100 days of his presidency, which starts January 20th. "Be very compulsive, as the President-elect says, at least for the first hundred days, and maybe more—everybody wear a mask," Fauci told Todd. 3 Dr. Fauci Says "Keep the Distance" You\'ll still need to stay six feet away from others, even as the vaccine is rolled out. "The vaccine availability will go a giant step to controlling the infection, but you\'re not going to completely eradicate it or eliminate it," Fauci has said. "The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus." The CDC and WHO recommend following these precautions: Keep 6 feet (2 meters) of distance between yourself and people outside your household."RELATED: 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say Doctors 4 Dr. Fauci Says "Avoid the Congregate Settings" The virus does not spread on its own. It needs humans to infect. That\'s why group settings are so dangerous, be they in a bar ("Avoid bars," Fauci has said) or in your own home, where you\'re hosting people you don\'t shelter with. Gatherings like that—over the holidays—are fueling the current surge. "I can just say, it doesn\'t matter who you are, where you are—when you have congregate settings, particularly indoors, when people are not wearing masks, that is a considerable risk for acquisition and spread of infection. No matter what the circumstance is, that is a risk," Fauci told ABC News. 5 Dr. Fauci Has Said Don\'t Slack on Washing Your Hands Every expert agrees: "Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol," according to the Mayo Clinic. So please do that, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 2}
