{'_id': '01accd5d98514a11d68b034dae1d562b', 'title': 'Rep. Dan Crenshaw Decided Pandemic Was Perfect Time to Buy and Not Disclose Stocks', 'description': 'Tom Williams/GettyRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) did not buy or sell any stocks in his first 13 months as a congressman. That changed in March 2020, when he made half a dozen buys as the largest economic relief package in history was written and debated.Five of those purchases came in the three days between March 25 and 27, as the Senate and House voted on the CARES Act and former President Trump signed it into law. Crenshaw, who supported the bill, did not initially disclose the transactions, in violation of the STOCK Act, a law that requires members of Congress to tell the public when they engage in securities trades. Months later he amended his records to reflect the purchases.The trades, which are listed only in a range of values, add up to a maximum of $120,000, and do not compare in size or volume to the kinds of headline-grabbing transactions executed ahead of the pandemic by Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. They only appeared in December, when Crenshaw amended his annual report, originally submitted in August.“You’re referencing financial disclosures that use a range to report stock purchases, and you’re choosing the upper end of the range to come up with that $120,000 figure,” Justin Discigil, Crenshaw’s communications director, told the Daily Beast in an email. “The real number is around $30,000 at most,” Discigil said, and “in no way were his purchases unethical or related to official business.”The timing, however, along with Crenshaw’s own trading history and connections to the industry, raises questions about why he made the purchases and failed, twice, to disclose them.“Members of Congress should not be actively trading securities in the middle of a crisis. It shows that when the market crashes, that person is thinking about themselves and using the volatility to their own advantage,” said Ben Edwards, a securities law expert and professor at the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Las Vegas Nevada. “We all have a limited amount of attention, and if you’ve got [an] eye on your stock portfolio, then you’re not giving that crisis or the American people the full attention they demand.”Crenshaw, elected in 2018, had never traded individual stocks in office until that crisis struck, according to public records. Then, when global markets crashed on March 12, Crenshaw bought between $1,001 and $15,000 in Amazon. Two weeks later, while Congress voted on the CARES Act, Crenshaw bought stocks valued at the same price range in Southwest, Boeing, energy infrastructure manfacturer SPX, and Kinder Morgan, a Texas-based company specializing in pipeline construction. He also bought into an index fund tied to the performance of the S&P 500.While it’s unclear why Crenshaw did not initially disclose the transactions, they came as an increasing number of high-profile lawmakers were getting snared in an insider-trading scandal. Except for the Amazon purchase, all of Crenshaw’s transactions came a week after ProPublica reported that Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) had sold up to $1.72 million on the heels of private coronavirus briefings. On March 20, The Daily Beast reported that Loeffler and her husband had sold off seven figures worth of stock following her first confidential briefings on the pandemic. Scrutiny soon fell on trades executed by Sens. David Perdue (R-GA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and John Hoeven (R-ND), spurring investigations by the Justice Department, the Senate Ethics Committee and the Securities and Exchange Commission. None of the lawmakers faced criminal charges. Perdue and Loeffler lost their re-election bids to Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock in runoff elections this January.In response to the scandal, the Campaign Legal Center analyzed all congressional stock trades made between Feb. 2 and April 8, finding that a dozen senators made a combined 127 transactions in the timeframe, and 37 House members made at least 1,358 transactions.Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw Dunks on Newly Elected QAnon Queen, Marjorie Taylor Greene Crenshaw’s name did not make it into those media reports, however, because he hadn’t disclosed his purchases. The STOCK Act, a 2012 law intended to deter federal elected officials from trading on inside knowledge, requires congress to post all transactions within 45 days. Not only did Crenshaw fail to disclose the transactions at the time, he didn’t include them in his annual disclosure, filed in August. And while that filing shows that Crenshaw holds the new assets, the form also requires members to list the transactions, including the dates, which Crenshaw left blank. They only appeared when the Lone Star Republican filed an amended annual report in December.Crenshaw’s spokesperson told The Daily Beast that the Harvard alum and former Navy SEAL had filed that amendment “to fix clerical issues in his report like making sure dates were correct.”At the time of the transactions, congress was scrambling to put together the CARES Act, a monumental emergency relief package that cost more than $2 trillion, and which Crenshaw supported. The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.At the time, Crenshaw sat on the House committees for Budget and Homeland Security. Boeing in particular lobbied heavily, and successfully, for a piece of the CARES Act, asking at first for $60 billion and later hoping to receive a $17 billion slice that lawmakers set aside for “businesses critical to maintaining national security.” The nonpartisan Institute on Tax and Economic Policy said at the time that it was “generally understood that the bill’s authors want much, if not all, of this $17 billion to go to a single company: Boeing.” But in late April, the manufacturer passed on the deal, opting instead to raise $25 billion in private investment thanks to moves that the Federal Reserve made independently of the CARES Act. The day that Crenshaw bought Boeing, markets snapped their brief positive burst, and the company led the boards that day in losses. His investment has now grown more than 38%. Boeing’s employee PAC gave $3,000 to Crenshaw’s 2020 campaign.All of Crenshaw’s purchases have shown returns, with the biggest yields from Boeing, Amazon and Southwest Airlines. Amazon bounced up from about $1,820 a share on March 12 to $2,979 today, and Southwest Airlines rose from around $41 to a little over $60.“It’s not hard to see that airlines would be among the hardest-hit stocks in a global pandemic that restricted air travel,” Edwards said. “So the short-term is that they’re going to get hammered, but in the long term, the sky is going to be busy again.” That calculation includes the likelihood that the federal government would pitch in to keep the industry aloft, and in mid-April the airlines got their $25 billion bailout.Edwards said that while the limited available information makes it impossible to know why Crenshaw and other officials make specific trades, new reforms introduced in response to the trading scandal would make such transactions impossible.“Some of the proposals for limiting stock purchases would really cut back on activity like this. For instance, Senator Warren’s plan would prohibit buying and selling individual stocks, and just allowing members to track markets through index funds,” he said. “Another proposal is to require lawmakers to disclose their trading plans in advance, which executives of publicly traded companies already do. That would reduce the likelihood or suspicion that they’re using private information or their own legislative powers to their advantage.”Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, told The Daily Beast in November that lawmakers in the public’s trust shouldn’t risk even the appearance of having a personal financial stake in their government work."It is nearly impossible to make decisions affecting an industry and then receive a personal financial benefit without appearing to have a conflict of interest," Payne said. "Even if officials rely on financial advisors to make trading decisions on their behalf, the perception of conflicts of interest remains, because the public does not know if there are winks and nods prompting the trades."Last week, Business Insider reported that Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), an advocate for transparency, had failed to disclose dozens of stock transactions over the course of 2020. Malinowski, who like Perdue — but unlike Crenshaw — claims that a third-party financial adviser independently executes his trades, said that his time in the barrell sharpened his appetite for reform.“This does reinforce my view that members of Congress should not be invested in the stock market or, if they are, they should not have any visibility into the stocks they own,” Malinowski later told NJ.com. “Inevitably, even if the decisions are made by an investment firm with no input from the member of Congress, there can be this perception of influence because what we do in Congress affects every aspect of the economy.”Crenshaw doesn’t own many individual stocks, currently. Beyond the trades in March, he only holds shares in Starbucks, Alphabet — Google’s parent company — and a small stake in Schlumberger, a global oilfield services provider primarily based in Europe, with a branch in Houston. The energy-dependent metropolis also hosts Kinder Morgan, but the offices of both companies are located just outside the lines of Crenshaw’s gerrymandered district.The trades intersect with Crenshaw’s government work, specifically in energy. The oil and gas industry contributed a total $453,247 to his 2020 re-election efforts, and was his largest industry patron in terms of PAC donations. And while this may not have posed a direct conflict of interest last year, that may no longer be the case: On Jan. 21, House Republican leadership took Crenshaw off of his Homeland Security and Budget committee assignments and moved him to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

{'_id': '0291947e506abed6324204531e115d4e', 'title': "How Biden's Solidarity Emboldened a Liberal Push for Power in Alabama", 'description': 'BESSEMER, Ala. — The first time Darryl Richardson tried to start a union, he was 23 years old and virtually alone in the effort. It failed, he lost his job, and he remembers the lasting fears of other employees who worried they would suffer a similar fate. Nearly 30 years later, Richardson’s penchant for agitation has not faded. He’s one of the workers seeking to unionize an Amazon warehouse outside Birmingham, Alabama, in a campaign that has targeted one of the world’s most profitable companies and its billionaire chief executive, and that has been invigorated by a wave of support from prominent politicians, including President Joe Biden. “I couldn’t believe he said something,” Richardson said of Biden’s video message last week in which he affirmed workers’ rights and warned against corporate intimidation. “It matters. It eased minds that might be worried about losing their job.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Mike Foster, one of the lead organizers for the union, was less surprised. “We’ve been waiting on him,” he said. When Biden weighed in on the contentious union debate in Alabama — which has pitted company against worker and neighbor against neighbor as a potentially broader labor push brews at a corporation that has long resisted similar efforts — he showed a new side of his nascent presidency. His words demonstrated a willingness to use his bully pulpit on behalf of communities that have often fallen outside the Democratic Party’s governing focus: working-class voters in Republican states, many of whom are Black. The message also elevated the national debate about the future of labor and unions, a cross-ideological issue on which Biden can uniquely find common cause with the progressive wing of his party even as many Democrats continue to shy away. Biden’s statement did not mention Amazon specifically and carefully avoided backing the union, calling instead for a fair election that followed federal labor guidelines. Still, for union supporters in Alabama, a state used to being on the back burner of national and Democratic politics, Biden’s video was taken as a sign that his pledges to pursue racial equity and curb corporate power were more than just campaign catchphrases. What’s more, the presidential nod to Alabama supercharged the Democratic arms race to find the next Georgia, a Southern state where the party capitalized on decades of organizing and demographic change to break Republicans’ grip on statewide elections. The task will be tougher in Alabama: The state is much more firmly Republican than its Southern neighbor, having ousted incumbent Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, by a healthy margin in 2020. The state has also not experienced the rapid demographic change that has made Georgia’s political transformation possible, and does not have its considerable numbers of college-educated suburban moderates. Still, Alabama Democrats see the growth of unions — and the vote in Bessemer — as a crucial first step. In that way, the blue banners hanging on the warehouse’s walls that read “vote” are about much more than a union, even if the larger effort faces greater odds. “Watching what happened in Georgia has given people a lot of hope,” said Kathleen Kirkpatrick, political director of Hometown Action, a statewide activist group. “What Stacey Abrams did started a decade ago and took a lot of help. So let’s think about where we are on that path.” Faiz Shakir, a close ally of labor leaders and served as the campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential bid, called Biden’s video “very impactful.” Shakir said he recalled how, on the campaign trail, he had often felt that labor issues were where there was the least amount of daylight between the progressive Sanders and the moderate Biden. Shakir said he had privately lobbied Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, to persuade Biden to speak out. And in a sign of the potential kinship between Klain and the left on labor, Shakir said he believed the president would have chosen Sanders as labor secretary if the Senate had not been split 50-50, making confirmations more difficult. “We have disagreed with him on health care and maybe climate and some other pieces, but there’s some good ideological overlap on this one,” Shakir said, noting that Biden’s general-election platform had been more progressive than his stances were in the primary race. Biden has, to this point, ignored progressive calls to embrace breaking up big technology companies like Amazon. “I can understand people were dubious about whether that was sincere or not, but our track record with Ron, with Joe Biden, and with the whole team is that when they say they’re going to do something, they will contemplate whether they want to make that commitment,” Shakir said. “And if they do make the commitment, that’s where they stand. They’re straightforward.” Although labor leaders, local union activists and national progressive politicians uniformly support an Amazon union in Alabama, that feeling does not reflect the mood inside the warehouse itself. With less than a month to go in the union vote, the 5,800-worker warehouse is split among supporters of the union, strong dissenters and an apathetic center that is growing sick of the national attention. Outside the plant — where some workers clock 12-hour shifts — union activists and journalists are likely to experience a string of exasperated rejections when asking to speak with employees. Some workers wear “Vote No” pins, while others talk of anti-union literature in the common areas and bathrooms. And on social media, employees post about longing for March 29, when the election will conclude. Amazon has aggressively countered the unionization effort, highlighting the company’s benefit package and its $15 minimum wage, as well as the job growth it has prompted in an economically stagnant area of the South. Last week, in a media round table of anti-union warehouse workers hosted by Amazon, some said that Biden’s message had been unnecessary, and that they did not feel intimidated by the company. A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to directly comment on the president’s remarks. “I know the president weighed in,” said J.C. Thompson, a process assistant at the warehouse. “And I can’t imagine the pressure our leadership is feeling because there’s a few people — a minority — who are disgruntled.” Carla Johnson, an employee in the warehouse, said she was voting not to unionize. “I can speak for myself,” she said. “I don’t need someone from the outside coming in and saying this or that.” The range of opinions hinted at why Biden’s message was so calibrated — supporting the workers’ right to a fair election but not supporting the union itself. And some observers, including employees at the Amazon warehouse, believe the president’s words will have little bearing on the outcome of the union vote. Catherine Highsmith, 24, said she would wager that some employees were not aware that the president had said anything. She sees his support for the workers as less important than parts of his agenda that remain unfulfilled, including raising the federal minimum wage and sending robust stimulus checks to Americans. “It’s a words versus actions thing,” Highsmith said. “It’s doesn’t feel right for me to say ‘thanks for helping me’ when you still have to help others.” Outsiders may see Bessemer as an unlikely place for a union showdown, but many residents disagree. This southwestern Birmingham suburb of about 25,000 people has a history of unionized iron and limestone workers. As jobs moved out the area in the 1950s, however, the city fell into poverty and despair, ranking sixth on a list in 2019 of the worst places to live in America. Last year, when Amazon opened the warehouse to the praises of local elected officials, the company hailed its arrival as a sign of economic revival in a predominantly Black area. With the coronavirus pandemic raging, Amazon offered thousands of jobs at a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour, more than double the state’s minimum. Some hailed it as a godsend. But by the fall, Richardson and others had already contacted the regional chapter of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union with complaints of poor working conditions, inflexible hours and a lack of coordinated representation in management. Liberal organizations seeking to make inroads in local politics have latched on to the union fight. The Alabama Coalition for Community Benefits, a collective of labor groups, progressive grassroots organizations and civil rights stalwarts like the NAACP, has supported the pro-unionization workers in Bessemer, and is also organizing employees at a nearby plant for the bus maker New Flyer. Foster, one of the RWDSU organizers in Bessemer, who works as a poultry processor at another company’s plant, said the efforts were indicative of a growing labor movement in the South, even in states that have passed strict right-to-work laws that ban mandatory union membership as a condition of employment. The political groups see something more, an outgrowth of the organizing that exploded during Donald Trump’s presidency. Millions of dollars poured into Alabama during the 2017 special election for the Senate in which Jones became the first Democrat to hold one of the state’s seats in the chamber since 1997. He lost his reelection bid last year, but Kirkpatrick argued that the union efforts were proof that the organizing infrastructure had lived on. “The legacy of union sensibilities in Alabama maybe don’t follow along partisan lines,” she said. “So regardless of the outcome, one of the things that we really did see over the course of the last three to four years was Democrats and progressive Democrats coming out of the woodwork. Waking up and realizing they weren’t the only person on the block in the retail workplace who has a progressive mindset.” On Friday, several congressional Democrats traveled to Bessemer to support the Amazon workers. Rep. Andy Levin of Michigan, a former union organizer, said it was “the most important election for the working people of this country in my lifetime.” “There is nothing I have done in Congress that is more important than standing here today and giving a little solidarity to these workers and their struggle for justice,” Levin said. But the national political implications matter less to people like Richardson and Highsmith, who believe a union is necessary to improve their daily working conditions. When thousands of Twitter users started a #BoycottAmazon campaign last week in solidarity with the union efforts, the RWDSU and local union organizers distanced themselves from the campaign, choosing to keep their focus on Bessemer. While liberal activists in Alabama see an opportunity to reshape the state’s politics, and national progressives seize on a shared priority with Biden’s administration, Richardson just wants to be able to take a long bathroom break without the fear of having his pay docked. “We’re taking on Goliath,” he said. “And the president has our back.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The internet giant had denied on its official Twitter account that drivers were skipping restroom breaks as they sought to meet delivery targets. In a post on Amazon News it said: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?” But according to documents leaked to The Intercept managers were aware of the practice. An internal email from a logistics manager in May last year said: "This evening, an associate discovered human faeces in an Amazon bag that was returned to station by a driver. "This is the 3rd occasion in the last 2 months when bags have been returned to station with poop inside. "We understand that DA’s [driver associates] may have emergencies while on-road, and especially during Covid DAs have struggled to find bathrooms while delivering. Regardless, DAs cannot, MUST NOT, return bags to station with poop inside." The memo continued: “We’ve noticed an uptick recently of all kinds of unsanitary garbage being left inside bags: used masks, gloves, bottles of urine." It called the behaviour by drivers "unacceptable" and said such incidents would be treated as "infractions". Another confidential internal document from January referred to “public urination” and “public defecation.” One employee told The Intercept: “Every single day of my shift I have to use the restroom in a bottle to finish my route on time. This is so common that you’ll often find bottles from other drivers located under seats in the vans. The fact that Amazon would tweet that is hilarious."', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '0de61856e32cf1d93d906ea25852df49', 'title': "Brazil's COVID Crisis Is a Warning to the Whole World, Scientists Say", 'description': 'RIO DE JANEIRO — COVID-19 has already left a trail of death and despair in Brazil, one of the worst in the world. Now, a year into the pandemic, the country is setting another wrenching record. No other nation that experienced such a major outbreak is still grappling with record-setting death tolls and a health care system on the brink of collapse. Many other hard-hit nations are, instead, taking tentative steps toward a semblance of normalcy. But Brazil is battling a more contagious variant that has trampled one major city and is spreading to others, even as Brazilians toss away precautionary measures that could keep them safe. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times On Tuesday, Brazil recorded more than 1,700 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day toll of the pandemic. “The acceleration of the epidemic in various states is leading to the collapse of their public and private hospital systems, which may soon become the case in every region of Brazil,” the national association of health secretaries said in a statement. “Sadly, the anemic rollout of vaccines and the slow pace at which they’re becoming available still does not suggest that this scenario will be reversed in the short term.” And the news just got worse for Brazil — and possibly the world. Preliminary studies suggest that the variant that swept through the city of Manaus is not only more contagious, but it also appears able to infect some people who have already recovered from other versions of the virus. And the variant has slipped Brazil’s borders, showing up in two dozen other countries and in small numbers in the United States. Although trials of a number of vaccines indicate they can protect against severe illness even when they do not prevent infection with the variant, most of the world has not been inoculated. That means even people who had recovered and thought they were safe for now might still be at risk and that world leaders might, once again, be lifting restrictions too soon. “You need vaccines to get in the way of these things,” said William Hanage, a public health researcher at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, speaking of variants that might cause reinfections. “The immunity you get with your cemeteries running out of room, even that will not be enough to protect you.” That danger of new variants has not been lost on scientists around the world. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pleaded with Americans this week not to let their guards down. “Please hear me clearly,” she said. “At this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we’ve gained.” Brazilians hoped they had seen the worst of the outbreak last year. Manaus, capital of the northern state of Amazonas, was hit so hard in April and May that scientists wondered if the city might have reached herd immunity. But then in September, cases in the state began rising again, perplexing health officials. An attempt by Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima to impose a new quarantine ahead of the Christmas holiday was met with fierce resistance by business owners and prominent politicians close to President Jair Bolsonaro. By January, scientists had discovered that a new variant, which became known as P.1, had become dominant in the state. Within weeks, its danger became clear as hospitals in the city ran out of oxygen amid a crush of patients, leading scores to suffocate to death. Dr. Antonio Souza remains haunted by the horrified faces of his colleagues and relatives of patients when it became clear his Manaus hospital’s oxygen supply had been exhausted. He thinks about the patient he sedated, to spare her an agonizing death, when the oxygen ran out at another clinic. “Nobody should ever have to make that decision,” he said. “It’s too terrible.” Maria Glaudimar, a nurse in Manaus, said she felt trapped in a nightmare early this year with no end in sight. At work, patients and their relatives pleaded for oxygen, and all the intensive care beds were full. At home, her son caught tuberculosis after contracting COVID-19, and her husband shed 22 pounds as he fought the virus. “No one was prepared for this,” Glaudimar said. “It was a horror film.” Since then, the coronavirus crisis has eased somewhat in Amazonas but worsened in most of Brazil. Scientists have scrambled to learn more about the variant and to track its spread across the country. But limited resources for testing have kept them behind the curve as they try to determine what role it is playing. Anderson Brito, a Brazilian virus expert at Yale University, said his lab alone sequenced almost half as many coronavirus genomes as all of Brazil had. While the United States has done genetic sequencing on roughly one in 200 confirmed cases, Brazil sequences about one in 3,000. The variant spread quickly. By the end of January, a study by government researchers found it was present in 91% of samples sequenced in the state of Amazonas. By the end of February, health officials had reported cases of the P.1 variant in 21 of 26 Brazilian states, but without more testing it is hard to gauge its prevalence. Throughout the pandemic, researchers have said that COVID-19 reinfections appear to be extremely rare, which has allowed people who recover to presume they have immunity, at least for a while. But that was before P.1 appeared and doctors and nurses began to notice something strange. João Alho, a doctor in Santarém, a city in Pará, a state that borders Amazonas, said that several colleagues who recovered from COVID-19 months ago had fallen ill again and tested positive. Juliana Cunha, a nurse in Rio de Janeiro who has been working at COVID-19 testing centers, said she assumed she was safe after catching the virus in June. But in November, after experiencing mild symptoms, she tested positive again. “I couldn’t believe it,” Cunha, 23, said. “It must be the variants.” But there is no way to be sure what is happening to people who are reinfected, unless both their old and new samples are kept, genetically sequenced and compared. One way to tamp down the surge would be through vaccinations, but the rollout in Brazil, as in so many countries, has been slow. Brazil began vaccinating priority groups, including health care professionals and the elderly, in late January. But the government has failed to secure a large enough number of doses. Wealthier countries have snapped up most of the available supply, while Bolsonaro has been skeptical both of the disease’s impact and of vaccines. Just over 5.8 million Brazilians — roughly 2.6% of the population — had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Tuesday, according to the health ministry. Only about 1.5 million had received both doses. The country is currently using the Chinese-made CoronaVac — which laboratory tests suggest is less effective against P.1 than against other variants — and the one made by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Margareth Dalcolmo, a pulmonologist at Fiocruz, a prominent scientific research center, said Brazil’s failure to mount a robust vaccination campaign set the stage for the current crisis. “We should be vaccinating more than a million people per day,” she said. “That is the truth. We aren’t, not because we don’t know how to do it, but because we don’t have enough vaccines.” Other countries should take heed, said Ester Sabino, an infectious disease researcher at the University of São Paulo who is among the leading experts on the P.1 variant. “You can vaccinate your whole population and control the problem only for a short period if, in another place in the world, a new variant appears,” she said. “It will get there one day.” Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, who called the variant a “new stage” of the pandemic, said last week that the government was ramping up its efforts and hopes to vaccinate roughly half of its population by June and the rest by the end of the year. But many Brazilians have little faith in a government led by a president who has sabotaged lockdowns, repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus and promoted untested remedies long after scientists said they clearly did not work. Just last week, the president spoke dismissively of masks, which are among the best defenses to curb contagion, claiming that they are harmful to children, causing headaches and difficulty concentrating. Pazuello’s vaccine projections have also been met with skepticism. The government last week placed an order for 20 million doses of an Indian vaccine that has not completed clinical trials. That prompted a federal prosecutor to argue in a legal filing that the $286 million purchase “puts millions of lives at risk.” Even if it proves effective, it will be too late for many. Tony Maquiné, a 39-year-old marketing specialist in Manaus, lost a grandmother, an uncle, two aunts and a cousin in the span of a few weeks during the latest surge of cases.

{'_id': '1392f3a3d87af15356c7ff691a7c30ce', 'title': 'Elon Musk Becomes World’s Second Richest Man, Knocking Bill Gates Into Third', 'description': 'But will it make him happy?The world’s biggest pissing competition saw developments Tuesday morning, after Elon Musk, 49, was crowned the second-richest person on Earth, nudging Bill Gates into third spot by a rounding error. Jeff Bezos, 56, the Amazon founder whose fortune is estimated at $182 billion, is still many tens of billions ahead of Musk at $127.9 billion. Fourth is luxury-goods magnate Bernard Arnault, 71; licking his wounds in lowly fifth place is Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, 36; while the sixth richest human is Warren Buffett, 90, with a pile of some $86 billion.Musk narrowly leapfrogged Gates, whose fortune is said to be $127.7 billion, on the Bloomberg chart following a further massive surge in Tesla’s share price, occasioned by news of the company being selected to join the S&P 500 index of leading U.S. companies a week ago. This saw the 49-year-old’s net worth rise by $7.2 billion.Incredibly, Musk’s wealth, which is intimately linked to the Tesla share price, has soared by more than $100 billion this year, making him by far the biggest gainer on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which lists the world’s 500 richest people. In January, Musk was in 35th place.Tesla’s shares have surged nearly 500 percent in 2020, driving its market value close to $500 billion. Three-quarters of Musk’s net worth comes from Tesla shares—he owns 21 percent of them.If Tesla can become a $650 billion company by 2028, Musk could net a bonus deal worth a record $55.8 billion, potentially eclipsing Bezos in the No. 1 spot. However whether Tesla can sustain its huge market value is the object of much debate; the company is expected to deliver around 320,000 electric vehicles this year, compared with Japanese carmaker Toyota’s annual production of about 10 million. Toyota has a market capitalization of around $236 billion.However, bulls argue that with sales of electric vehicles expected to triple over the next few years, Tesla is well-positioned for further exponential growth.The mercurial Musk is also a major player in the space industry; his company SpaceX last week sent four astronauts to the International Space Station on its Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule under a commercial contract with NASA. SpaceX is about to launch 60 broadband internet satellites into orbit.Gates, 65, who co-founded Microsoft, was the world’s richest person for years before being knocked off the top slot by Bezos in 2017. Gates has given more than $50 billion to help fight disease and poverty, mainly through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has also backed the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Bezos has seen his fortune drop back slightly since the height of the pandemic as Amazon’s share price has fallen on news of vaccines being successfully produced.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': '1f35a87183ae7c4438da81a32849f285', 'title': 'They Were on Equal Footing. Then the Ground Shifted.', 'description': 'Robin Arnone, a part-time trainer before the coronavirus pandemic, hasn’t set foot in the Colosseum Gym in Columbia, Maryland, since the virus shut it down almost a year ago. The gym is open again, but she doesn’t need the work. Things are going gangbusters in her other job as a home appraiser, and she hasn’t looked back. For Julie Stark, one of Arnone’s best friends and a professional dog walker, things are not so rosy. With many clients stuck at home in the pandemic and taking care of their own pets, her services are no longer in demand. Instead of walking seven dogs each day, she now walks three. Stark has had to economize, eliminating dance and gymnastics classes for her children to save $350 a month. She doesn’t know when her clients will want her back, but it’s not something she discusses with Arnone. “We don’t talk about money,” Stark said. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It would be awkward if she were a dog walker and doing unbelievably well,” she added. “I’m happy for her.” And there is a lot in Arnone’s life to be happy about. She replaced her used Lexus with a new one last year, and in December she indulged herself with a $550 Dyson hair dryer. “It felt a little ridiculous,” she said of the purchase. “But I worked hard, and if there’s any year I’m going to do it, it’s this year.” Arnone and Stark are among the millions of friends who were on a relatively equal financial footing before last March — people who would have thought nothing of splitting the check on a night out — and now find themselves on vastly different trajectories. Lockdowns changed what Americans can do as well as what services they need, and in the process created divergent fates for many workers. The pandemic has wreaked havoc on many who were already struggling. Nearly 10 million fewer people have jobs, and some 26 million reported not always having enough to eat, according to Census Bureau data. For the 50% or so of the population that makes up the middle class — defined by Pew Research Center as having an income ranging from around $45,000 to $135,000 for a household of three — the toll has been uneven. Like a tornado, the pandemic can devastate one household and leave neighboring ones unscathed. Arnone’s world, in the Washington-Baltimore area, exemplifies that. The gym where she worked, the Colosseum, is owned by her friend Tim Gallagher. His monthly income at the gym is down 25 to 30%, and a quarter of the gym’s members have suspended their accounts. To save money, he has lowered the thermostat at home to 60 degrees from 65, and while his truck has more than 340,000 miles on it, he has no plans to replace it. “You just got to scrape along and gut it out,” he said. “We’re really struggling to get by.” But in Arnone’s other field, home appraising, her friends and colleagues are reaping rewards from the booming housing market, where January sales were up 23.7% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Ultralow mortgage rates have prompted a wave of refinancings, which require fresh appraisals. “I don’t have much to complain about,” said Traci Warner, a friend of Arnone’s and a home appraiser in Waldorf, Maryland, south of Washington. After her husband was laid off from his sales job in April, Warner’s work picked up the slack. It’s not that things are perfect, but unlike Gallagher, she does not feel that she is barely hanging on. This contrast is mirrored in the larger economy. Weekly unemployment claims by newly laid-off workers remain at historically elevated levels even as stock indexes reach record highs. Vaccines have arrived, but their slow rollout means it will be months before anything resembling normal activity can resume at restaurants, hotels, gyms, airports, malls and other businesses that depend on bringing people together. “It’s very uneven,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a forecasting and research group. “The recovery for the most vulnerable parts of the population will take years.” Not only are wages and salaries down for the hardest-hit segments of the workforce, he noted, but so are overall employment and participation in the labor force. At the very top, the gains have been staggering. In eight months after the pandemic hit the United States, the wealth of the country’s roughly 650 billionaires grew by $1 trillion, according to a November study by the Institute for Policy Studies and other progressive groups. That included a $70 billion lift for just one of those magnates: the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. White-collar employees, having emerged mostly unscathed from the sharp downturn in 2020, are looking forward to what they hope will be a robust recovery in 2021 once most people are vaccinated. Service workers, devastated by the idling of entire industries amid lockdowns and other restrictions, just want the pain to abate. The split was evident in the latest jobs report from the Labor Department. While professional and business services employment jumped by 97,000 in January, that job growth was almost entirely offset in the private sector by losses in the retail, leisure and hospitality industries, among others. So while lines at food banks lengthen, new Teslas dot parking lots, and there are waiting lists for Peloton machines so the most fortunate can keep up with their workouts from home. Peter Atwater, a lecturer in economics at the College of William & Mary, has popularized a term for this phenomenon: the K-shaped recovery. While one arm of the K ascends, the other is driving lower. “There’s an enormous divide in confidence,” he said. “And we buy and spend based on how we feel.” Janet Yellen, the newly confirmed Treasury secretary, extended the metaphor during her confirmation hearings. “We are living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built upon wealth, while working families fell farther and farther behind,” she said. Life on the Upside Arnone misses her days at the gym, especially spending time with clients. It is the first time since she was 15 that she hasn’t worked as a trainer, she said. But she is feeling pretty good otherwise. Before the pandemic, she would train people in the morning and shift to her real estate work in the afternoon. Now she rises at 6 a.m. to start writing up appraisals before hitting the road to visit as many as eight homes in a day. “I’ve declined a boatload of appraisal jobs,” she said. “I just didn’t have the time.” After typically handling 500 appraisals a year, she did 635 last year. She is paid by the banks that issue the mortgages, and last year, she estimates, she earned roughly $250,000 for her services, up from about $185,000 in previous years. She lives in Woodbine, Maryland, 25 miles west of Baltimore, and although she still thinks of herself as middle class, she said her nieces told her she was upper middle class; she concedes that they’re probably right. It’s a world away from the apartment where she grew up in Randallstown, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, as the child of a single mother. “Thinking back, I had no clue,” Arnone said. “I didn’t realize how much we didn’t have. If I wanted something, my mom would go without, but I didn’t have the nicest clothes or the name brands.” Maybe that’s why she feels a little ashamed of her good fortune when she sees news stories about long lines at food banks or other evidence of the pandemic’s economic woes. “When I throw out the veggies I never got to eat, my mother’s Catholic guilt weighs on me,” she said. Home appraisal is a boom-and-bust business, driven by the housing market’s cycles. But with interest rates near record lows, and new buyers shopping for houses while existing homeowners refinance, work is plentiful for now. Warner — Arnone’s friend and fellow home appraiser — traded in her Honda Accord, which had more than 300,000 miles on it, for a 2017 BMW X3, not long ago, and was able to go to the beach in Delaware with her family last summer. This month, they went skiing in Virginia. “Our finances are pretty good,” added Warner, 51. “The market has been amazing.” Arnone, by her own description, is a worrywart and had done her training work on the side to supplement her income. Now she doesn’t feel the need. “The gym was always my safe place, and it’s weird not seeing Tim and other friends — I miss them,” she said. “But I won’t lie. It’s nice to have more time and more flexibility.” The Long Wait for Normal A year ago, Stark felt things were going her way. Five years earlier, she started a business as a dog walker and pet sitter, after having been a veterinary technician. “It was perfect,” she said, until the pandemic arrived. Now her clients are home and can walk their dogs themselves. And the decline in travel leaves little need for pet sitters. “I’m holding out hope that my clients will need me again,” she said. She has been surviving with help from her parents, child support from her ex-husband and unemployment benefits. Stark has her hands full with her own pets in the meantime. She has two rescue dogs, Roxy and Luke, as well as two cats. Everyone, she adds, gets along. She did get one new client during the pandemic, but most of the so-called pandemic puppies adopted in the past 11 months are being walked by their owners or their children, she said. She isn’t sure whether her old clients will come back when the pandemic recedes or she will be walking the new dogs. Sometimes she thinks of returning to a 9-to-5 job outside the house. “Part of me just wants a stable job and a regular paycheck,” she said. It doesn’t seem realistic, though: With her two daughters, ages 10 and 14, in school remotely, she needs to be at home most of the time. “I’m just hoping things will return to normal,” she said. Government aid has been crucial for helping people like Stark and Gallagher weather the pandemic. And their reliance on it underscores why many economists believe more federal assistance is necessary, especially if the K-shaped recovery continues. “Political leaders and policymakers have a big role to play in getting that bottom leg of the K up,” Daco of Oxford Economics said. “They hold the key to a stronger labor-market recovery that is as inclusive as possible and will reduce the long-term damage to the economy.” Gallagher, the owner of the Colosseum Gym, recently applied for a second round of small-business loans. That, and forbearance from his landlord, should enable him to keep Colosseum open in the months ahead. Still, he is not expecting an imminent recovery. “I think it’s going to take till the end of the year,” he said. “We’re allowed to operate at 50% of capacity. But I don’t have to worry about 50% because everybody is scared to death to come in.” The warnings from Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, haven’t helped business, Gallagher added. “His COVID briefings are deadly to my gym,” he joked. “Every time he opens his mouth, another five or six people put their memberships on hold.” In the meantime, Gallagher’s decisions reflect the continuing economic pain. He has laid off most of his part-time employees. Normally, he and his wife would go out several times a week, but now one outing is the limit. “That’s a big splurge for us,” he said. They have also dropped premium channels from their cable service. At the gym, a popular gathering spot for hard-core weightlifters, the clanging of the machines has been replaced by background music and the whirring of the treadmills occupied by the most devoted exercisers. And public health officials have warned that high-intensity workout sessions at gyms can spread the coronavirus, potentially threatening Colosseum’s revival. Gallagher said there was little personal training going on. Maybe five or six guests are out on the floor while Gallagher keeps himself busy cleaning up and fixing equipment. Every so often, he signs up a new member, with dues running at $59 a month. He is confident that eventually — on the other side of the pandemic — people will want to come back to the gym. Not everyone, though. He is concerned that members who have fallen out of the gym habit may never return. “It’s going to take longer to make up for those memberships and get other people to join,” he said. “A few people will never want to go to the gym, or the movies or where there are crowds of people. It’s a shame.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Elizabeth Warren is spearheading a Democratic wealth tax proposal this week that could potentially generate $3 trillion in tax revenue from the wealthiest Americans over a decade. The Numbers: Warren has proposed a 2% wealth tax on Americans who have at least $50 million in wealth. Under her proposal, that rate would rise to 3% for Americans with at least $1 billion in wealth. Related Link: Market Experts React To GameStop Hearing: \'Congress Needed To Dig Deeper\' Under the proposed plan, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos would owe $5.7 billion in taxes for 2020. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk would owe about $4.6 billion. In a statement this week, Warren said the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act would help offset the widening of the wealth gap during the pandemic. Soaring stock prices have increased billionaire wealth by about 40% since the COVID-19 crisis began, Warren said. In an interview on CNBC on Tuesday, Warren said the tax wouldn’t include any individual assets valued at less than $50,000. “I think most people would rather be rich and pay 2 cents. This is not very fancy. It really is a tax on fortunes above $50 million,” Warren said. Economists estimate the proposed tax would impact fewer than one in 1,000 American families, or less than 0.1% of the wealthiest Americans. Economists from the University of California Berkeley estimate the plan would generate about $3 trillion in tax revenue over a 10-year stretch. Warren has proposed that tax revenue be invested in child care, early education and infrastructure. The plan would also invest $100 billion into the IRS and ensure a 30% audit rate on super wealthy Americans. The plan also calls for a 40% exit tax on anyone who renounces their citizenship to avoid a wealth tax. Wealth Tax Criticisms: Warren’s plan has already been hit with criticism from Republicans and wealthy Americans. On Wednesday, billionaire Leon Cooperman said the tax would encourage wealthy Americans to find ways to hide their wealth. “The idea has no merit. It’s foolish. It probably is not legal,” he told CNBC. One of the biggest criticisms of a wealth tax is the difficulty of enforcement. Capital gains taxes and income taxes are easy to enact because their amounts are clear and easily assessed. A wealth tax would require some means of regularly and fairly assessing the value of illiquid assets, such as rare art and collectables. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently said any wealth tax has “very difficult implementation problems." It appears at this point that the wealth tax has a small likelihood of making it through Congress given that Republicans and even some Democrats oppose it. President Joe Biden did not include a wealth tax among his proposals during the 2020 campaign. When asked about Biden’s views on the plan on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not explicitly endorse it. Benzinga’s Take: The idea of a wealth tax on billionaires is appealing in concept, but the logistics are a nightmare. Warren’s wealth tax is unlikely to make it through Congress given the thin Democratic majority in the Senate, but investors should watch for the Biden administration to do something in the near-term to address the massive widening of the American wealth gap during the pandemic.

{'_id': '2ac74ccb05ed4f9b57411eb0a7a46e1c', 'title': 'With 3 Billion Packages to Go, Online Shopping Faces Tough Holiday Test', 'description': 'E-commerce became a lifeline for consumers and companies during the pandemic. But this holiday season, online shopping will strain the industry as never before: An estimated 3 billion packages will course through the nation\'s shipping infrastructure -- about 800 million more than delivered last year.This flood of packages is hitting shipping companies at the end of a year of frenzied demand for everyday household items by a public largely stuck at home and wary of doing its buying in person. The deliveries could make or break some smaller retailers already on the edge financially because of lockdowns and fewer customers in their stores.Packages that don\'t arrive by Christmas will be a disappointment for customers but a disaster for these struggling retailers, which have been forced by the coronavirus pandemic to rebuild their business around e-commerce. The future of retailing is increasingly online, and companies don\'t want to give customers any reason to think they can\'t deliver.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"Everyone is preparing for the worst and holding their breath," said Ravi Shanker, a transportation analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It is far easier to lose at peak shipping than to win."To cope with the surge, the large shipping companies have expanded weekend deliveries and hired more workers. They have also played hardball with retailers, introducing steep holiday surcharges on shipments and enforcing strict limits on how many packages companies can send out each day.FedEx and UPS, the biggest private U.S. carriers, have enormous leverage over how many packages will be delivered and when, and some retailers worry about pushing back against their demands for fear of being cut off.But the carriers are also under pressure, largely from Amazon, which has been building out its own logistics business and is becoming increasingly independent in shipping. If more retailers falter this holiday, that only strengthens Amazon\'s dominance.By one accounting, 7.2 million more packages need to be shipped each day this holiday season than the system has the capacity to handle.That figure came from ShipMatrix, which provides technology to the shipping industry. Its president, Satish Jindel, said expanded weekend deliveries were covering part of that shortfall, "but not all of it.""Demand exceeds capacity, no matter what part of the country you are in," he said.Many brands, both large and small, have yanked forward order deadlines for customers who want to receive items by Christmas and posted reminders on their websites to order early.Beatrice Bakery in Beatrice, Nebraska, which expects to sell 750,000 pounds of fruitcake this holiday, set a cutoff of Dec. 9 -- nearly a week earlier than last year -- while the Disney Store is advertising a Dec. 10 deadline.Typically, shipping volumes during the holidays are 30% to 40% higher than at other times of the year. But those levels were being reached this year long before people started buying Christmas gifts. Even Amazon struggled to keep up with the demand in the early days of the pandemic.The shipping companies say they are better prepared for the holidays. FedEx said it was hiring 70,000 seasonal employees, and UPS said it would hire 100,000. That expansion pales next to the preparation at Amazon, which said it was building 100 new fulfillment warehouses, sorting centers and delivery facilities across North America. The company has hired 275,000 full-time and part-time workers since the start of the year and 100,000 seasonal workers to handle the increased volume.Major shipping companies are also preparing to distribute coronavirus vaccines, though most of those shipments are not likely to start until next year.Some retailers are already reporting delays.Executives at Kendra Scott, the contemporary jewelry brand, said they had discussed rising sales during the holidays with UPS but were told this past week that deliveries would be delayed because of capacity issues. On Wednesday, an alert about the delays was at the top of the Kendra Scott website."I don\'t know how it could be as unexpected as it appears to have been," said Tom Nolan, the brand\'s president. "We are not getting what we were told we would get when we embarked on our holiday season."Nolan said the delays were particularly frustrating because customers tended to blame the brands, rather than the shipping companies."We\'re paying a fee to a shipping provider to hold them to the expectations we have," he said.Kendra Scott employees scrambled, including moving goods to some of its 100-plus stores and warehouses that were closer to certain customers. But Nolan was uncertain about how the rest of the month would look."We\'re trying to work that out now and anticipate, coming closer to the holidays, is this going to get better or going to get worse?" he said. "This is not a free service that we\'re talking about. We pay a premium to get this done effectively, and the expectation is that it\'s done effectively."One retailer that sells apparel and accessories has already been grappling with UPS\' capacity restrictions and surcharges, which can add several dollars to a package and increase its overall cost by 25% to 40%, according to two company executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation from UPS.The parcel limits were based on holiday volumes from last year, even though many more people are shopping online this year. Once a day\'s quota is reached, remaining parcels must be pushed to the next day, the executives said, a move that can then snowball into other days.Overall, delays have been relatively minimal so far, analysts say. A UPS representative said the carrier was "delivering previously agreed upon, collaboratively planned package volume, but there are limits on unplanned volume until we have capacity in our network that we can steer it toward."Still, many retailers are urging customers to pick up orders in stores or curbside.Several major chains have begun partnerships outside the orbit of major carriers, offering same- or next-day delivery. Sephora and Best Buy have deals with Instacart, while Bed Bath & Beyond teamed with Shipt. But they are costly alternatives and capture a small slice of business.Helena Price Hambrecht, a co-founder of Haus, an aperitif brand in Sonoma County, California, said she had been told that starting Wednesday, the local FedEx truck would limit order pickups from her company to 500 per day through December. The company will use its own vehicles to drop off its remaining orders at FedEx hubs in the area."People don\'t realize the dance going on behind the scenes, and this year it all really came to the surface because the more layers of supply chain you rely on, the more things can break," Hambrecht said. "A lot of it is expectation-setting, but a lot of it is happening at the last minute because people are having last-minute situations come up. It really is the Wild West right now."When asked about Haus, FedEx said, "We work closely with our customers to understand their volume and identify opportunities to ensure the best possible service throughout the season."The shipping calculus for the smallest retailers leaves little margin for error. Doug Haney, who owns Bike Adirondacks, a cycling business in Saranac Lake, New York, ships his products though the U.S. Postal Service. This year, the shipping rates for smaller items like T-shirts and hoodies have gone up, and Haney is absorbing some of the costs."A $5 price point for shipping for a small order is what people want to spend," he said. "Otherwise, it becomes unappealing."Shipping companies are walking a tightrope, too. In some past years, they were criticized for not having enough employees to handle the packages, leading to delays. But in other years, investors criticized them for hiring too many drivers and sorters, lowering profits."You have to match the resources with the volume," said Shanker, the Morgan Stanley analyst. "It is easy to get that wrong."Consumers have been following unpredictable shopping patterns this year. Working from home, many started online holiday shopping earlier and during work hours. There were fewer online sales on Cyber Monday, after the Thanksgiving weekend, than analysts had predicted, leading some to believe that the shopping season is being spread out over many months and that a shipping crunch can be avoided."Some of this increased anxiety about shipping delays is real, and some of it might be manufactured," said Dave Gill, vice president of Insights and Analytics for Rakuten Intelligence.Richard Meyer, president of Beatrice Bakery, whose signature offering is Grandma\'s Fruitcakes, said he thought shipping companies were placing the onus on the merchants to manage expectations. Last week, he received an email from a big carrier advising how to talk to customers about shipping issues."We are the ones that have to do the explaining," Meyer said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Congress granted the HHS permission to move pandemic-related money between accounts, though the agreement stipulated the agency had to give lawmakers a heads up. In this case, it appears the HHS siphoned the funds quietly, albeit with permission from its top lawyer. Other attorneys told Stat that the agency likely did have the wiggle room to carry out the action. Former Office of Management and Director Russ Vought defended the decision and said "we would do it again," telling Stat that not only did the administration have the authority, it was also "the right thing to do in order to move as quickly as possible because lives were on the line." Other Trump officials seemed to agree, per Stat, arguing that successful vaccines would reduce hospitalizations, making Warp Speed the more consequential outlet. It\'s still unclear whether the decision has resulted in less money for health care providers, as the Biden administration remains mum on the subject, Stat reports. Read more at Stat News.

It’s very much true that “personnel is policy” and that the records of the people he chooses for key roles can indicate what kind of president he intends to be.How are the picks so far? Well, the bad news for progressives is that there has not yet been a single person announced that the left can be enthusiastic about. The best that can be said of the nominees is that they are generally “not as bad as we might have feared”. Some of the choices are deeply concerning. Others border on the unobjectionable. Most are relatively predictable, as Biden is making it clear he intends to hew as closely as possible to the Democratic politics of the Obama years. Here are a few worthy of note.Antony Blinken, Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, is one of the Obama veterans, having previously served as deputy national security adviser and deputy secretary of state. Blinken is a card-carrying member of what is sometimes called the “Blob”, the DC foreign policy establishment, which has a consensus set of beliefs that the US must remain a dominant global power, and a willingness to use military force to maintain that power.Blinken previously broke with Biden to support the (disastrous) armed intervention in Libya and has argued that Israel should keep receiving colossal amounts of US military aid even if it refuses to honor international agreements. (He also suggested that the US would never publicly criticize the Israeli government.) Blinken’s statement that diplomacy needs to be “supplemented by deterrence” is a sign that he will have little interest in reining in the sprawling US global military empire, and his statements about “undermining” and “isolating” Russia suggest we could see an increase in the cold war-type rhetoric that has been gaining such an alarming foothold in the Democratic party.In fact, at a recent Aspen Security Forum discussion, Blinken favorably quoted from the cold warrior George F Kennan, who argued that the Soviet Union was inherently expansionist and needed to be dealt with through “containment”. Blinken said Kennan’s worldview was “eerily up to the moment”, though Kennan’s views escalated the tensions that nearly led to nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Blinken’s appointment is taken as a sign that “internationalism is back” in the White House, but it’s an internationalism that divides the world into America’s allies and its rivals.Janet Yellen as treasury secretary offers little to complain about, though it is notable that Biden did not heed calls to put a trust-buster like Elizabeth Warren in the role. Yellen is a highly respected academic economist and former Federal Reserve chair who is relatively apolitical, and her appointment has excited other Democratic economists including Lawrence Summers and Paul Krugman. Even the socialist economic analyst Doug Henwood says Biden “could have done a lot worse” than Yellen. The good news about Yellen is that she is not an advocate of austerity policies and has spoken of the need for the government to extend “extraordinary fiscal support” during the pandemic.> On immigration, climate change, and foreign policy, the administration needs to be subjected to ceaseless public pressureThe appointment of John Kerry as special envoy for climate is perhaps Biden’s way of signaling that he takes climate change seriously – as Democrats up until now tragically have not. I say it’s “Biden’s way” because it’s not necessarily a good way to show a commitment to taking serious action on climate – Kerry has “stature” and “experience”, and, thank God, actually does believe in the reality of climate change (unlike the present administration). But he is also known as a man long on words and short on actions. Even worse, Kerry favors an approach to dealing with climate change that rests on commodifying and selling nature rather than preserving it as our common inheritance.He recently published an op-ed explaining “how to better tackle climate change” which focused entirely on nudging the free market into putting a price on carbon. Nothing about how to deal with the equity effects of carbon pricing (ie making sure the financial burden doesn’t end up falling on the poor). Nothing about the federal government taking action to convert the electric grid, shutting down fossil fuel-reliant power stations, and investing in renewable energy. Nothing about a Green New Deal. And given Kerry’s record of defending the expansion of US fossil fuel production under Obama, he’s very unlikely to get tough on the companies most responsible for the problem. Climate activists should be incredibly concerned by the appointment of Kerry, who may acknowledge that the problem exists, but will almost certainly attempt phony business-friendly “solutions” and half-measures. It will require a huge fight to get the Biden administration to take real action.Also deeply concerning is the selection of Avril Haines for director of national intelligence. Haines is a former deputy CIA chief from the Obama years, and while much news coverage has dwelled on her quirky life history – she rebuilt a plane! She’s a brown belt! She owned a bookstore! – she also played a key role in overseeing the drone strike program under Obama. This should be completely disqualifying, because Obama’s use of drones was a national disgrace.There has been very little accountability or acknowledgment of how bad it was. Anyone involved with the program should have been prosecuted. Instead they’re being rewarded. Haines was involved with an initiative to supposedly make the drone program more responsible – and less likely to turn Yemeni weddings into funerals – but the ACLU pointed out that the fixes were completely inadequate and Human Rights Watch notes that Obama paved the way for Trump to deploy similarly lawless killing powers.That’s not all. As Spencer Ackerman reported for the Daily Beast in July, Haines was involved in the sham “accountability” process that shielded CIA officials from being punished for their involvement with torture. Haines also supported Gina Haspel’s nomination as CIA director, despite Haspel’s direct supervision of the torture program. If Haines couldn’t even oppose the appointment of a torturer as CIA director, how can she be expected to rein in American intelligence agencies’ abuses of power?Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s nominee to lead the Department of Homeland security, is considered likely to roll back some of the Trump administration’s cruelest immigration policies. Mayorkas was one of the original architects of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) and is considered a positive choice by advocates for immigrant rights. But it’s very unclear whether Mayorkas is committed to the equitable treatment of immigrants. When he previously served at the department, an inspector general’s report found that he had personally intervened to help rich people, including Hollywood producers, Vegas casino owners, and the former Democratic National Committee chair and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, get around the usual immigration rules. The report was deeply damning, even quoting a witness who said Mayorkas explicitly prioritized “people with money” and bullied anyone on his staff who questioned the wisdom of his decisions.What about the broader transition team? Well, it does contain executives from companies like Lyft, Airbnb, Amazon, Capital One, Booz Allen, Uber, Visa and JPMorgan, suggesting that Biden’s administration has no intention of challenging the country’s most powerful corporations and instead sees them as partners in governance. But the team is a mixed bag. The education team, for instance, contains several teachers’ union officials, which may signal a willingness to move away from the Obama administration’s controversial pro-charter approach. It looks as if Biden is trying to draw from many different parts of the party, including the nonprofit world and the elite law firm world.It’s true, as the neoconservative turned Democrat Max Boot wrote in the Washington Post, that Biden’s team lacks obvious “grifters, trolls and fanatics”. The Trump administration has been full of so many incompetent and ghoulish ideologues that that bar for Biden’s selections is uncommonly low. But we cannot afford to celebrate this return to “experienced” establishment politics, because the Washington from which these people come is a morally corroded place. As Andrew Bacevich, a critic of American imperial aggression, puts it, Biden’s “team has a belief in American supremacy which could lead them to recklessness in their use of American military power”. They may not be thieves or rightwing hardliners, and the Biden administration is sure to be a huge improvement on its disastrous predecessor. But progressives need to watch out: on immigration, the climate crisis and foreign policy, the administration needs to be subjected to ceaseless public pressure, its inevitable serious failings called out and exposed.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Now we're starting to know just how big the spending spree was.               New data Tuesday (March 31) shows UK supermarkets were the busiest they've ever been.               Market researcher Nielsen says people there made over 79 million extra grocery shopping trips in the four weeks to March 21.               They spent an extra 1.9 billion pounds on groceries - about 2.4 billion dollars.               Top of the shopping list were items for the so-called 'pandemic pantry' - essentials from toilet paper to pasta.               Figures from around Europe are likely to show something similar.               But now retailers could face a new challenge - holding onto their staff.               Workers at one branch of Carrefour walked out this week over concern they could catch the virus.               French law gives them the right to withdraw if they feel their health is being put at risk.               Europe's biggest retailer now says it's supplying masks to all staff to address concerns.               Austria says it will make it compulsory for shoppers to wear masks to address similar worries there.               But anxiety is spreading through the retail industry.               Recent days have seen protests and walkouts at Amazon depots in France and Italy as staff demand better safety measures.

Photograph: Carolina Cabral/Getty Images Venezuela’s strongman president, Nicolás Maduro, has sent an emergency shipment of oxygen to his country’s border with Brazil in a politically charged gesture he said was to help alleviate “Jair Bolsonaro’s public health disaster”. In recent days the Brazilian state of Amazonas, which borders southern Venezuela, has been plunged into coronavirus chaos for the second time in under a year. Last week Covid-19 patients reportedly died in the state capital, Manaus, after hospitals ran out of oxygen amid a surge in infections and deaths. Since then civil society groups, celebrities and the Brazilian government have been scrambling to get life-saving supplies to the remote riverside metropolis. Maduro, who enjoys a toxic relationship with Brazil’s far-right president, announced his aid offer in a Sunday night broadcast. “Venezuela is reaching out to the people of Amazonas in solidarity … and we hope this oxygen reaches the people of Brazil fast … The trucks are on their way,” he said as state television aired images of a convoy supposedly heading to the border town of Santa Elena de Uairén\u200b. Maduro said Brazil was facing an “alarming situation in the face of Jair Bolsonaro’s public health disaster”. “What a painful and sad situation,” the leftist added, claiming a “a veritable international scandal” was playing out in Amazonas. “It hurts us, as Bolivarians, as the children of Bolívar, to see our Latin American brothers [like this].” Maduro called the shipment an act of Christian charity, but it is also an obvious attempt to score political points over Bolsonaro, whose jumbled and anti-scientific handling of the pandemic has been internationally condemned. Brazil’s president was a key member of the US-backed coalition that tried to topple Maduro and Bolsonaro allowed Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to visit Brazil’s border with Venezuela on the eve of last year’s US presidential election. While on Brazilian territory, Pompeo labelled Maduro a drug trafficker who had destroyed his country. Many members of the Brazilian left celebrated Maduro’s gesture. “From day one of his presidency Bolsonaro has insulted … the governors and people of Venezuela. And now, wouldn’t you know it, it’s … the governors and people of Venezuela helping save the people of Manaus,” tweeted former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, accusing Bolsonaro of showing “inhuman indifference” to the city’s plight. Members of Venezuela’s opposition, however, denounced Maduro’s intervention as a cynical ploy designed to improve his shabby international reputation. They remembered how thousands of Venezuelan refugees had escaped into the Brazilian Amazon in recent years, fleeing poverty, hunger, violence and a devastated public health system. “It’s as if someone, with one of their relatives dying of hunger, gives food to a neighbour as a gift to make it seem like they’re a nice guy,” the opposition leader Julio Borges told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo. “Maduro wants to pose as the leader of the poor, the needy, of those infected with coronavirus, when in fact he is a corrupt dictator and a human rights abuser who has managed to destroy Venezuela, once one of the most prosperous countries in the Americas.”', 'num_of_covid': 1}

What used to be relatively simple gadgets that logged how many steps people took have morphed into holistic systems that promise to guide us and our doctors to improve our health, and maybe even spot illnesses like COVID-19 before we know we\'re sick.The principle behind these technologies is that collecting more data will help make us healthier. The message from experts I spoke with is that there\'s potential in that idea, but it hasn\'t been fulfilled yet.For now, health and fitness tracking systems can be very useful for some people -- but not for everyone. I know people who swear by their fitness trackers to help manage their weight, and others who exercise more because the Apple Watch gives them kudos for doing so.One big limitation of health devices, though, is that many people don\'t know what to do with the data they see about their heart rate or how many hours they slept."We\'re not doing a very good job of educating people what to do with that information. That\'s the piece that\'s missing," said John Jakicic, director of the Healthy Lifestyle Institute at the University of Pittsburgh.The companies behind health tracking technologies know this is a problem, and they\'re increasingly promising to suggest actions that people -- or their physicians -- can take from all the data that the tracking gadgets collect.Amazon said, for example, that its health tracking system might be able to suggest which workout is most effective for someone. Fitbit says its sensors can score your stress level. Amazon, Apple and other companies are also trying to integrate information from their health technologies into electronic medical records. In principle, that means a patient with a heart condition could share daily electrocardiogram readings with her doctor.But it\'s not always clear whether the insights from these health trackers are helpful or accurate. Jessilyn Dunn, a Duke University professor who studies uses of medical data collected from wearable devices, said that researchers usually can\'t access or validate the assessments that tech companies are making from people\'s data.Dunn said she was optimistic about the potential of health tracking technologies for clinicians and the rest of us. But she said that the lack of transparency made it difficult to know why a health tracking technology might suggest that someone needed another hour of sleep or could be at risk of a dangerous heart abnormality.So, if you\'re considering buying a health tracking technology, consider what you realistically might get out of it. Will it be helpful to know how much you slept or for Amazon to estimate your stress level from the tone of your voice? Think about whether you trust the company behind the health tracker with sensitive information from your body.You might find these trackers helpful. But don\'t expect them to be miracle cures.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

A global rally in technology shares has boosted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and paved the way for initial public offerings from the likes of DoorDash Inc.Those gains, which had been widely expected, were offset by fallout from Son’s decision last year to start dabbling in trading stocks and options. SoftBank posted a 285.3 billion yen derivatives loss in the period. That led to an overall loss in the asset management arm of 113.5 billion yen, up from 85.2 billion yen in the previous three-month period.“The Vision Fund’s stellar performance in the past few quarters continues to cover for the losses on options trading,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “SoftBank could argue those derivatives were for hedging purposes, but Son’s venture into trading is definitely not looking good so far.”In a presentation to investors after the results, Son focused on his successes. He reprised his argument that SoftBank is like a goose that lays golden eggs, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! two decades ago, to companies like Uber and DoorDash more recently. Some 15 companies have gone public from the Vision Fund so far, he said.“Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,” he said, pacing a stage in a white turtleneck sweater and grey jacket. “We are finally in the harvesting stage.”He said Vision Fund 1 and Vision Fund 2 have invested in a total of 131 companies. In the case of DoorDash, SoftBank invested about $680 million for a stake now worth about $9 billion, he said, while its $7.7 billion investment in Uber is worth $11.3 billion.The Tokyo-based company had a net income of 1.17 trillion yen in the December period and did not release operating profit figures. At least six more portfolio companies are planning IPOs this year.“There is a lot of liquidity out there and investors are particularly partial toward tech stocks,” Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “At some point the IPO fatigue sets in, but doesn’t seem like we are there yet. For now, the window of opportunity is open for SoftBank.”After shares plunged in March with the coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank unveiled plans to sell off 4.5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and fund buybacks. The selloff included part of its interests in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the Japan telecommunications unit. SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for $40 billion.SoftBank held a total of $22 billion of “highly liquid listed stocks” as of the end of quarter, including a $7.39 billion investment in Amazon.com Inc., $3.28 billion in Facebook Inc. and $1.38 billion in Alphabet Inc. The operation is managed by its asset management subsidiary SB Northstar, where Son personally holds a 33% stake.The investments were accompanied by derivatives that amplified exposure, but SoftBank has been winding down its options strategy amid a backlash from investors. The fair value of SoftBank’s futures and options positions came to little over $1 billion at the end of December, compared with $2.7 billion the previous quarter. Long call options on listed stocks have dwindled to $1.68 billion from $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks declined to $238 million from $1.26 billion of value.Son said that the losses in the asset management arm have swung to a profit of about 100 billion yen since the end of last quarter. But the operations remain in a “test-drive stage,” he said.Alibaba, Son’s most stark investment success to date and SoftBank’s largest asset, saw its shares plunge about 20% last quarter amid a Chinese government clampdown that scuttled the planned listing of its affiliate Ant Group Co. Founder Jack Ma had all but vanished from public view, prompting investor unease before he resurfaced last month.Son said he remained in touch with Ma, without giving specific details of their communications. He said Ma likes to draw and shares his drawings with Son via chat; the SoftBank chief also sketches but hasn’t shared any of his work. Son also said he saw the increased antitrust scrutiny of Ma’s businesses in China as part of the country’s natural evolution.SoftBank’s own sale of Arm to Nvidia is still making its way through the approval process gauntlet. The United Kingdom and European Union are both preparing to launch probes into the deal, the Financial Times reported last week. Son said he remained confident that it will receive a green light at the end.SoftBank has also joined the blank-check company frenzy with plans for several special purpose acquisition companies. SVF Investment Corp. raised $525 million last month to address sectors like mobile communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud technologies and software. LDH Growth Corp I plans to raise as much as $200 million to target Latin American and Hispanic markets.SoftBank last week filed for two more SPACs, seeking to raise another $630 million. The new SoftBank vehicles, SVF Investment Corp. 2 and 3, will target the same diverse areas of technology as the first, including mobile communications and artificial intelligence, according to filings Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“Consistently good performance by Vision Fund portfolio companies also helps the SPAC’s prospects because investors can extrapolate management expertise,” said Tang at United First Partners. “It underlines their skill in deploying capital.”SoftBank may see between 10 to 20 public listings a year from its portfolio of 164 startups across three different funds, Son said. A typical early-stage venture capital fund might see a third of its bets pay off, but SoftBank’s portfolio of late-stage companies should do better than that, he said. Even WeWork has received SPAC interest, he said.The billionaire struck a tone that was reminiscent of the days before the WeWork fiasco in late 2019. He said the key to turning “white egg” investments into golden egg hits was “turbo-charging” startups with “overwhelming capital,” more ambitious goals and synergies with other portfolio companies.Son’s presentation then took a turn for the comical. He flipped to an animated slide of a goose tagged with “AI revolution” text and a line of golden eggs marching out of its backside to Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker.“Investment is a rhythm,” Son said. “But please don’t look at this too seriously.”(Updates with Son’s comments on Alibaba, derivatives from 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images Sign up for the Guardian Today US newsletter Amazon caused an uproar on Thursday when it denied reports that its delivery workers have been forced to urinate in bottles due to lack of access to bathrooms, but a leaked internal memo shows the company has been aware of the problem for at least several months. Documents provided by employees at Amazon to the Intercept showed that an email sent in May 2020 admonished workers for urinating in bottles and defecating in bags while on the job. “This evening, an associate discovered human feces in an Amazon bag that was returned to station by a driver,” the email reads. “This is the 3rd occasion in the last 2 months when bags have been returned to station with poop inside. We understand that DA’s [driver associates] may have emergencies while on-road, and especially during Covid, DAs have struggled to find bathrooms while delivering.” Dear lord. https://t.co/BLdFCwkfTm pic.twitter.com/obvdMpKyy3— Alex Kantrowitz (@Kantrowitz) March 25, 2021 Workers told the Intercept the issue was commonly referred to in internal discussions, with one former Amazon employee telling the publication that drivers are “implicitly forced to do so, otherwise we will end up losing our jobs for too many ‘undelivered packages.’” The revelation followed a combative tweet from Amazon aimed at a Wisconsin congressman, who took the company to task over working conditions. The saga unfolded amid a showdown with workers in Alabama who are trying to unionize the workplace. It’s not the first time workers at Amazon, which is known for its gruelling hours, have spoken out about the problem. Workers have previously told the Guardian they needed to urinate inside water bottles on a daily basis for fear of missing delivery rates. A forum on Reddit dedicated to Amazon drivers, which, while impossible to vet completely for authenticity, nonetheless shows hundreds of comments from drivers claiming they frequently have to urinate in water bottles for lack of bathroom breaks while on the job, particularly as the Covid-19 pandemic increased the amount of deliveries. Amazon saw a 37% increase in sales in one quarter alone in 2020 and executive Jeff Bezos personally saw his personal net worth increase by $70bn during the pandemic. The bathroom controversy exposed on Thursday marks just the latest blowback surrounding how Amazon treats employees – and its delivery drivers in particular. Earlier this week, Vice reported drivers were being forced to sign “biometric consent” forms to continue working for the retailing giant. These forms would allow AI-powered cameras to keep watch over the drivers, who number around 75,000 in the United States, while on the clock. Evan Greer, the deputy director of workers rights and privacy advocacy group Fight for the Future, said lawmakers must ban biometric surveillance entirely, because workers trying to stay afloat during precarious times cannot reasonably be expected to turn down the policy if it means losing a job. “Forcing workers to agree to constant monitoring by racist, AI powered surveillance cameras or get fired is not how consent works,” she said. “Lawmakers should act now to ban these practices entirely. No one should be forced to work in inhumane conditions, and hand over their sensitive biometric information to their boss, just to put food on the table.” Amazon did not respond to request for comment.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '6eba53ff0c5a97a5bfcc77ff9982c6fa', 'title': 'As Understanding of Russian Hacking Grows, So Does Alarm', 'description': 'On Election Day, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the nation\'s top cyberwarrior, reported that the battle against Russian interference in the presidential campaign had posted major successes and exposed the other side\'s online weapons, tools and tradecraft."We\'ve broadened our operations and feel very good where we\'re at right now," he told journalists.Eight weeks later, Nakasone and other U.S. officials responsible for cybersecurity are now consumed by what they missed for at least nine months: a hacking, now believed to have affected upward of 250 federal agencies and businesses, that Russia aimed not at the election system but at the rest of the U.S. government and many large American corporations.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThree weeks after the intrusion came to light, U.S. officials are still trying to understand whether what the Russians pulled off was simply an espionage operation inside the systems of the American bureaucracy or something more sinister, inserting "backdoor" access into government agencies, major corporations, the electric grid and laboratories developing and transporting new generations of nuclear weapons.At a minimum it has set off alarms about the vulnerability of government and private-sector networks in the United States to attack and raised questions about how and why the nation\'s cyberdefenses failed so spectacularly.Those questions have taken on particular urgency given that the breach was not detected by any of the government agencies that share responsibility for cyberdefense -- the military\'s Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, both of which are run by Nakasone, and the Department of Homeland Security -- but by a private cybersecurity company, FireEye."This is looking much, much worse than I first feared," said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "The size of it keeps expanding. It\'s clear the United States government missed it.""And if FireEye had not come forward," he added, "I\'m not sure we would be fully aware of it to this day."Interviews with key players investigating what intelligence agencies believe to be an operation by Russia\'s SVR intelligence service revealed these points:-- The breach is far broader than first believed. Initial estimates were that Russia sent its probes only into a few dozen of the 18,000 government and private networks it gained access to when it inserted code into network management software made by a Texas company named SolarWinds. But as businesses like Amazon and Microsoft that provide cloud services dig deeper for evidence, it now appears Russia exploited multiple layers of the supply chain to gain access to as many as 250 networks.-- The hackers managed their intrusion from servers inside the United States, exploiting legal prohibitions on the National Security Agency from engaging in domestic surveillance and eluding cyberdefenses deployed by the Department of Homeland Security.-- "Early warning" sensors placed by Cyber Command and the National Security Agency deep inside foreign networks to detect brewing attacks clearly failed. There is also no indication yet that any human intelligence alerted the United States to the hacking.-- The government\'s emphasis on election defense, while critical in 2020, may have diverted resources and attention from long-brewing problems like protecting the "supply chain" of software. In the private sector, too, companies that were focused on election security, like FireEye and Microsoft, are now revealing that they were breached as part of the larger supply chain attack.-- SolarWinds, the company that the hackers used as a conduit for their attacks, had a history of lackluster security for its products, making it an easy target, according to current and former employees and government investigators. Its chief executive, Kevin Thompson, who is leaving his job after 11 years, has sidestepped the question of whether his company should have detected the intrusion.-- Some of the compromised SolarWinds software was engineered in Eastern Europe, and American investigators are now examining whether the incursion originated there, where Russian intelligence operatives are deeply rooted.The intentions behind the attack remain shrouded. But with a new administration taking office in three weeks, some analysts say the Russians may be trying to shake Washington\'s confidence in the security of its communications and to demonstrate their cyberarsenal to gain leverage against President-elect Joe Biden before nuclear arms talks."We still don\'t know what Russia\'s strategic objectives were," said Suzanne Spaulding, who was the senior cyberofficial at the Homeland Security Department during the Obama administration. "But we should be concerned that part of this may go beyond reconnaissance. Their goal may be to put themselves in a position to have leverage over the new administration, like holding a gun to our head to deter us from acting to counter Putin."Growing Hit ListThe U.S. government was clearly the main focus of the attack, with the Treasury Department, the State Department, the Commerce Department, the Energy Department and parts of the Defense Department among the agencies confirmed to have been infiltrated. (The Pentagon insists the attacks on its systems were unsuccessful, though it has offered no evidence.)But the hacking also breached large numbers of corporations, many of which have yet to step forward. SolarWinds is believed to be one of several supply chain vendors Russia used in the hacking. Microsoft, which had tallied 40 victims as of Dec. 17, initially said that it had not been breached, only to discover this week that it had been -- and that resellers of its software had been, too. A previously unreported assessment by Amazon\'s intelligence team found the number of victims may have been five times greater, though officials warn some of those may be double-counted.Publicly, officials have said they do not believe the hackers from Russia\'s SVR pierced classified systems containing sensitive communications and plans. But privately, officials say they still do not have a clear picture of what might have been stolen.They said they worried about delicate but unclassified data the hackers might have taken from victims like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including Black Start, the detailed technical blueprints for how the United States plans to restore power in the event of a cataclysmic blackout.The plans would give Russia a hit list of systems to target to keep power from being restored in an attack like the one it pulled off in Ukraine in 2015, shutting off power for six hours in the dead of winter. Moscow long ago implanted malware in the U.S. electric grid, and the United States has done the same to Russia as a deterrent.A Supply Chain CompromisedOne main focus of the investigation so far has been SolarWinds, the company based in Austin, Texas, whose software updates the hackers compromised.But the cybersecurity arm of the Department of Homeland Security concluded the hackers worked through other channels, too. And last week, CrowdStrike, another security company, revealed that it was also targeted, unsuccessfully, by the same hackers, but through a company that resells Microsoft software.Because resellers are often entrusted to set up clients\' software, they -- like SolarWinds -- have broad access to Microsoft customers\' networks. As a result, they can be an ideal Trojan horse for Russia\'s hackers. Intelligence officials have expressed anger that Microsoft did not detect the attack earlier; the company, which said Thursday that the hackers viewed its source code, has not disclosed which of its products were affected or for how long hackers were inside its network."They targeted the weakest points in the supply chain and through our most trusted relationships," said Glenn Chisholm, a founder of Obsidian Security.Interviews with current and former employees of SolarWinds suggest it was slow to make security a priority, even as its software was adopted by America\'s premier cybersecurity company and federal agencies.Employees say that under Thompson, an accountant by training and a former chief financial officer, every part of the business was examined for cost savings, and common security practices were eschewed because of their expense. His approach helped almost triple SolarWinds\' annual profit margins to more than $453 million in 2019 from $152 million in 2010.But some of those measures may have put the company and its customers at greater risk for attack. SolarWinds moved much of its engineering to satellite offices in the Czech Republic, Poland and Belarus, where engineers had broad access to the Orion network management software that Russia\'s agents compromised.The company has said only that the manipulation of its software was the work of human hackers rather than of a computer program. It has not publicly addressed the possibility of an insider being involved in the breach.None of the SolarWinds customers contacted by The New York Times in recent weeks were aware they were reliant on software that was maintained in Eastern Europe. Many said they did not even know they were using SolarWinds software until recently.Even with its software installed throughout federal networks, employees said SolarWinds tacked on security only in 2017, under threat of penalty from a new European privacy law. Only then, employees say, did SolarWinds hire its first chief information officer and install a vice president of "security architecture."Ian Thornton-Trump, a former cybersecurity adviser at SolarWinds, said he warned management that year that unless it took a more proactive approach to its internal security, a cybersecurity episode would be "catastrophic." After his basic recommendations were ignored, Thornton-Trump left the company.SolarWinds declined to address questions about the adequacy of its security. In a statement, it said it was a "victim of a highly sophisticated, complex and targeted cyberattack" and was collaborating closely with law enforcement, intelligence agencies and security experts to investigate.But security experts note that it took days after the Russian attack was discovered before SolarWinds\' websites stopped offering clients compromised code.Offense Over DefenseBillions of dollars in cybersecurity budgets have flowed in recent years to offensive espionage and preemptive action programs, what Nakasone calls the need to "defend forward" by hacking into adversaries\' networks to get an early look at their operations and to counteract them inside their own networks before they can attack, if required.But that approach, while hailed as a long-overdue strategy to preempt attacks, missed the Russian breach.By staging their attacks from servers inside the United States, in some cases using computers in the same town or city as their victims, according to FireEye, the Russians took advantage of limits on the National Security Agency\'s authority. Congress has not given the agency or homeland security any authority to enter or defend private-sector networks. It was on these networks that SVR operatives were less careful, leaving clues about their intrusions that FireEye was ultimately able to find.By inserting themselves into the SolarWinds\' Orion update and using custom tools, they also avoided tripping the alarms of the "Einstein" detection system that homeland security deployed across government agencies to catch known malware, and of the so-called CDM program that was explicitly devised to alert agencies to suspicious activity.Some intelligence officials are questioning whether the government was so focused on election interference that it created openings elsewhere.Intelligence agencies concluded months ago that Russia had determined it could not infiltrate enough election systems to affect the outcome of elections and instead shifted its attention to deflecting ransomware attacks that could disenfranchise voters and influence operations aimed at sowing discord, stoking doubt about the system\'s integrity and changing voters\' minds.The SolarWinds hacking, which began as early as October 2019, and the intrusion into Microsoft\'s resellers gave Russia a chance to attack the most vulnerable, least defended networks across multiple federal agencies.Nakasone declined to be interviewed. But a spokesperson for the National Security Agency, Charles Stadtlander, said, "We don\'t consider this as an \'either/or\' trade-off. The actions, insights and new frameworks constructed during election security efforts have broad positive impacts for the cybersecurity posture of the nation and the U.S. government."In fact, the United States appears to have succeeded in persuading Russia that an attack aimed at changing votes would prompt a costly retaliation. But as the scale of the intrusion comes into focus, it is clear the U.S. government failed to convince Russia there would be a comparable consequence to executing a broad hacking on federal government and corporate networks.Getting the Hackers OutIntelligence officials say it could be months, years even, before they have a full understanding of the hacking.Since the extraction of a top Kremlin informant in 2017, the CIA\'s knowledge of Russian operations has been diminished. And the SVR has remained one of the world\'s most capable intelligence services by avoiding electronic communications that could expose its secrets to the National Security Agency, intelligence officials say.The best assessments of the SVR have come from the Dutch. In 2014, hackers working for the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service pierced the computers used by the group, watching them for at least a year and at one point catching them on camera.It was the Dutch who helped alert the White House and State Department to an SVR hacking of their systems in 2014 and 2015, and last month, they caught and expelled from the Netherlands two SVR operatives accused of infiltrating technology companies there. While the group is not known to be destructive, it is notoriously difficult to evict from computer systems it has infiltrated.When the SVR broke into the unclassified systems at the State Department and White House, Richard Ledgett, then the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said the agency engaged in the digital equivalent of "hand-to-hand combat." At one point, the SVR gained access to the NetWitness Investigator tool that investigators use to uproot Russian back doors, manipulating it in such a way that the hackers continued to evade detection.Investigators said they would assume they had kicked out the SVR, only to discover the group had crawled in through another door.Some security experts said that ridding so many sprawling federal agencies of the SVR may be futile and that the only way forward may be to shut systems down and start anew. Others said doing so in the middle of a pandemic would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, and the new administration would have to work to identify and contain every compromised system before it could calibrate a response."The SVR is deliberate, they are sophisticated, and they don\'t have the same legal restraints as we do here in the West," said Adam Darrah, a former government intelligence analyst who is now director of intelligence at Vigilante, a security firm.Sanctions, indictments and other measures, he added, have failed to deter the SVR, which has shown it can adapt quickly."They are watching us very closely right now," Darrah said. "And they will pivot accordingly."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Musk said he wants to focus more on the new Tesla plant underway in Texas and his SpaceX venture…adding that California had become "a little complacent" and "a little entitled." The move comes after Musk had publicly feuded with the state when Health officials in Alameda County shut down Tesla\'s Fremont factory in the spring over coronavirus concerns.  The months-long dispute culminated in Musk defying health orders, suing local officials and threatening to move Tesla\'s operations out of the state. The plant eventually Was re-opened. His personal move to Texas might also potentially offer some tax reprieve for the world\'s second richest man. It does not collect personal income tax while California has some of the highest state tax rates in the United States. A 670% rally in Tesla shares this year has boosted Musk\'s net worth from $27 billion to $155 billion, just behind Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

And at his funeral in Brazil\'s Parque das Tribos, or Tribes\' Park, on Thursday (May 14), members of the indigenous Kokama tribe gathered to do just that. Wearing masks that read "indigenous lives matter," people like nurse Vanderlecia Ortega dos Santos paid their respects to a man who fought endlessly to protect the lives of indigenous tribes of the Amazon -- only to lose his own to the novel coronavirus. His simple wooden coffin -- placed in the unfinished school he fought hard to have built, but never got to see inaugurated. "It is thanks to the fight of Chief Messias that we have our sacred place within the city of Manaus. It is the Tribes\' Park and it is representative of the struggle and the bravery that he had -- to face down the great lions of society. We are always fighting against the state because of this marginalization of indigenous citizens." Many members of the Kokama tribe, including the late chief himself 22 years ago, traveled down to the Manaus region in search of a better life. Chief Messias helped create Tribes\' Park here, a ramshackle settlement where 3,000 people from over 30 different Amazon tribes now reside. But for the most part they have continued living in poverty on the city\'s outskirts. With little access to public healthcare, Nurse dos Santos is one of the only frontline volunteers caring for her tribal community during the pandemic. She was also the one who took the late chief to the hospital. "Here in the Tribes\' Park we still have this dream of quality education and health, because we have not yet been provided with assistance during the pandemic. The Chief\'s death is also representative of what\'s lacking, a lack of health, what\'s missing for the indigenous who live in the city." Brazil\'s some 850,000 indigenous people now find themselves particularly at risk. The country has over 200,000 coronavirus cases and counting, overwhelming hospitals and resulting in around 14,000 deaths. Many being buried without being granted a proper send-off, and even coffins in vertical cemeteries -- being stacked on top of one another like bricks in a wall.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.3% last month. That’s much smaller than the increase in September, which was downwardly revised, and less than what economists had expected.               Sales of apparel and sporting goods fell more than 4%. Even grocery sales slumped, as did restaurant receipts. But Amazon’s “Prime Day” shopping extravaganza helped drive sales at online merchants up 3%.               Restraining overall sales growth last month: the resurgence in new COVID-19 infections and declining household income. A federal weekly unemployment supplement has lapsed. Millions of freelancers and gig workers will soon lose government-funded benefits next month. And another government benefits program will lapse at the end of December. Amid those concerns, consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in early November.               For the rest of the year, economists expect moderate growth in retail sales. That will contribute to slower economic growth following the sharp, historic rebound in the third quarter.

{'_id': '96cfe9b4839fca86b4722e618af79815', 'title': 'Giving Billions Fast, MacKenzie Scott Upends Philanthropy', 'description': 'On a Monday evening in November, Dorri McWhorter, the chief executive of the YWCA Metropolitan Chicago, got a phone call from a representative of billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott. The news was almost too good to be true: Her group would be receiving a $9 million gift.Between the pandemic and the recession, it had been a difficult year for the Chicago YWCA, which runs a rape crisis hotline and provides counseling to women on jobs, mortgages and other issues. Money was tight. McWhorter shed tears of joy on the call.Similar scenes were playing out at charities nationwide. Scott\'s team recently sent out hundreds of out-of-the-blue emails to charities, notifying them of an incoming gift. Some of the messages were viewed as possible scams or landed in spam filters. Many of the gifts were the largest the charities had ever received. McWhorter was not the only recipient who cried.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAll told, Scott -- whose fortune comes from shares of Amazon that she got after her divorce last year from Jeff Bezos, the company\'s founder -- had given more than $4 billion to 384 groups, including 59 other YWCA chapters."Women-led, Black women-led organizations tend to be at the very bottom of the pile for philanthropists," McWhorter said. Scott "has a recognition that the organizations are doing the good work and let us be the stewards of those dollars."In the course of a few months, Scott has turned traditional philanthropy on its head. Whereas multibillion foundations like Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have fancy headquarters, Scott\'s operation has no known address -- or even website. She refers to a "team of advisers" rather than a large dedicated staff.By disbursing her money quickly and without much hoopla, Scott has pushed the focus away from the giver and onto the nonprofits she is trying to help. They are the types of organizations -- historically Black colleges and universities, community colleges and groups that hand out food and pay off medical debts -- that often fly beneath the radar of major foundations."If you look at the motivations for the way women engage in philanthropy versus the ways that men engage in philanthropy, there\'s much more ego involved in the man, it\'s much more transactional, it\'s much more status driven," said Debra Mesch, a professor at the Women\'s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University. "Women don\'t like to splash their names on buildings, in general."As she did in July when she announced donations of $1.7 billion to 116 organizations, Scott unveiled her latest round of philanthropy through a post on Medium.She noted that she had made "unsolicited and unexpected gifts given with full trust and no strings attached." Such strings are a mainstay of modern philanthropy: onerous grant proposals and nerve-wracking site visits, followed by reports on the variety of performance bench marks that charities are required to meet to keep the money flowing."Not only are nonprofits chronically underfunded, they are also chronically diverted from their work by fundraising and by burdensome reporting requirements that donors often place on them," Scott wrote.Charitable groups applauded the unconditional nature of Scott\'s gifts."That mentality of trust is what we need in philanthropy," said Katie Carter, chief executive of the Pride Foundation in Seattle, an LGBTQ+ charity that received a $3 million donation.Scott has moved away from "the heavy hand of the philanthropy in steering the direction of social change," said Benjamin Soskis, a senior research associate in the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute. Many big-time donors, he said, "model themselves off of venture capitalism and take an extremely aggressive approach in terms of monitoring" the performance of grant recipients.Experts on philanthropy said Scott\'s nearly $6 billion in gifts might be among the most ever handed out directly to charities in a single year by a living donor (as opposed to a billionaire making a huge one-time gift to a foundation to be disbursed over decades). And rather than a few targeted donations, she gave broadly to hundreds of groups."She\'s moved extraordinary sums out the door, quickly, in an anti-paternalistic way," said Rob Reich, co-director of the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford.Foundations are required by law to pay out at least 5% of their endowments a year. Many only barely meet that requirement, instead hoarding their cash and giving away less than the profits they earn through investments. That allows their endowments to keep growing and the foundations to survive in perpetuity, and some foundations argue that it allows them to take the time to make grants that will yield the best results.But during a deep recession and an era of epic inequality, the traditional approach has fueled criticisms that foundations are more interested in preserving themselves than in helping those in desperate need.Scott\'s disbursement of $6 billion in about five months only accentuated the stodgy pace of her peers. It also distinguished her from her former husband, the richest man in the world. Bezos has made some big charitable commitments but has not made philanthropy a top priority.Scott, who declined to comment, rocketed to public attention with the announcement nearly two years ago that she and Bezos were divorcing. As part of their split, she received 4% of the outstanding shares of Amazon. They were valued at the time at $38 billion. Today, they are worth about $62 billion, although it\'s unclear how many of the shares Scott still holds.Scott and Bezos met when they both worked at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw. She was behind the wheel when she and Bezos drove to Seattle to start an online bookstore named after a Brazilian river.Scott is working on her giving with the Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit organization in Boston that advises charities and philanthropies, including those set up by Gates and Michael Bloomberg, as well as the Ford and Rockefeller foundations.A spokesperson for Bridgespan said that the group was "not in a position to share details about our client\'s processes," adding, "What we can say is that we feel very privileged to get to do this work."Scott described in her Medium post how her team used hundreds of emails and phone interviews and thousands of pages of data analysis to sift through 6,490 potential gift recipients. After "deeper research" into 822 of them, she and her advisers selected 384 groups to receive nearly $4.2 billion in funds."Usually you don\'t have very large philanthropists wandering the landscape looking to drop millions of dollars very quietly into organizations that they care about," said Adam Zimmerman, president and chief executive of Craft3, which gives loans to small businesses in Oregon and Washington and which received a $10 million gift from Scott. "The first email literally got stuck in my junk mail."Scott announced the names of groups that got gifts, but she didn\'t disclose how much each received. And although Scott offered a list of nearly 400 organizations, she could well have given gifts to other groups.If Scott was making her donations through a foundation, she would be required to publicly disclose the amounts and recipients of all gifts. But she is not using a foundation. Instead, at least some of her donations -- including the gift to the Chicago YWCA -- were made through a Fidelity donor-advised fund. That fund will eventually disclose the groups that received money, but is not required to say who is behind each gift. Scott is under no obligation to publicly disclose anything about her giving."She has not been transparent either about the vehicles being used for philanthropy or about the process," said Reich of Stanford\'s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. "Power deserves scrutiny."But the criticism of Scott has tended to be more constructive than pointed."We\'re in this very polarized time where there is tremendous, you could say obscene, wealth held among these very elite individuals," said Elizabeth Dale, a professor specializing in philanthropy at Seattle University. "If their choice is to hold onto that wealth or give it away, I\'m going to come down on the side of giving it away every time."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

However, Pichai\'s email did not mention vaccination requirements for return to the office. Google has recommended that employees obtain the vaccine when their health care provider or local public health authority makes it available, a company spokeswoman told NYT.Work from home has become a hot debate topic since the pandemic outbreak with various leaders\' varying opinions.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s comments Friday didn’t lift investor sentiment. He defended his decision to end the Federal Reserve’s key pandemic lending programs on December 31.  Financial stocks such as JPMorgan Chase and Visa helped drag the Dow and S&P 500 lower. Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook weighed on the Nasdaq. Shares of Pfizer and BioNTech rose.

Thomson Reuters Stocks Buzz Analyst, Terence Gabriel:  “Even with the additional positive news we have seen on the vaccine front, we.have yet to move above that high. So it does seem as if it’s struggling here, perhaps internally overheated and focused though stimulus.” Shares of Gilead Sciences fell.

The head of the World Health Organization called recent increases in deaths and cases “truly worrying trends.”AstraZeneca Plc said it will release up-to-date results from the final stage trial of its vaccine within 48 hours, responding to criticism from a U.S. science agency. The European Union and Britain edged toward breaking their deadlock over the drugmaker’s shots, while Germany will impose a hard lockdown over Easter to try to reverse a wave of infections.Progress in fighting the crisis is showing signs of stalling. While fatalities in the U.S. and U.K. ease, places like India and eastern Europe are seeing a resurgence. Hungary is short of doctors and nurses, forcing hospitals to put out a call for untrained volunteers.Key Developments:Global Tracker: Cases pass 123.7 million; deaths top 2.72 millionVaccine Tracker: More than 458 million shots given worldwideHong Kong vaccine rollout hampered by reliance on Chinese shotsVaccinating some of world’s remotest communities tests Australia‘Too many questions’: Decades of mistrust spur vaccine hesitancyWhere are we in hunting for the coronavirus’s origin?: QuickTakeSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here.

The drug binds to an enzyme called a protease to keep the virus from replicating. Protease-inhibiting medicines have been successful in treating other types of viruses, include HIV and Hepatitis C.The new protease inhibitor is the second such medicine Pfizer has brought into human trials to treat Covid-19. Pfizer is testing another given intravenously to hospitalized virus patients.NYC Municipal Workers Will Return May 3 (10:30 a.m. NY)New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said about 80,000 city workers will return to their offices beginning May 3, a promise he outlined in his State of the City address in January.“We’re going to have strict safety measures in place,” de Blasio said Tuesday during a virus briefing. “It’s another step toward the full recovery of New York City.”The city has administered more than 3.4 million vaccines and is expecting a “major boost” in supply in early April, the mayor said.

We do not know how the epidemic is developing and where there are pockets that remain.”In a separate presentation, Fauci sounded a more positive tone. He said people should remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook, even as U.S. cases plateau following recent declines.“I don’t think that that should cause us to despair,” Fauci said in an online talk while being welcomed as an honorary fellow by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. “As we continue to vaccinate more and more people, which will ultimately give us control of the outbreak, we’ve got to remember we can’t just completely turn off all public health measures.”Countries Loosen Visitor Rules (8:20 a.m. NY)Cyprus will open its borders starting April 1 to visitors from Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K., the country’s tourism ministry said. Those with a negative test result who haven’t come into close contact with a confirmed case will be guaranteed a quarantine-free stay.

The target is to triple the pace of inoculation to half a million people per day by mid-April, reaching 80% coverage by the end of September.Some U.S. Nursing Homes See First Cases (5 p.m. HK)Hundreds of U.S. nursing homes have reported their first confirmed Covid infections in 2021 after reporting none last year, according to a report by a consumer watchdog agency. While cases in the facilities have been dramatically reduced, the findings show the crisis hasn’t been eliminated despite the nationwide vaccination effort.Hong Kong Dashes Hopes for Looser Rules (4:40 p.m. HK)Hong Kong’s government has dashed business leaders’ hopes for a near-term easing of the city’s quarantine measures, signaling in a private meeting that any relaxation would require a dramatically higher vaccination rate and prolonged drop in local cases.Hungary’s Doctors Plead for Tougher Curbs (4:27 p.m. HK)Hungary has run out of doctors and nurses to deal with Covid-19 patients, forcing hospitals to put out a call for volunteers without any medical training.

Economists expected the rate to rise to 5.2%.Regeneron Cocktail Cuts Hospitalizations 70% (2:53 p.m. HK)Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it would apply for U.S. authorization for a lower dose of its Covid-19 antibody cocktail, after data from a final-stage trial showed early use of the drug reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 70%.Malaysia, Singapore Vaccine Certification (2:46 p.m. HK)Malaysia and Singapore are working toward reciprocal vaccination certification as the Southeast Asian neighbors plan to restore cross-border travel. Operational details, including the application process involved for entry and exit between the two nations will be discussed further.Covid Patients Should Postpone Surgery: Study (2:15 p.m. HK)Surgery should be delayed seven weeks for people who test positive for Covid-19 to reduce the risk of dying, according to the COVIDSurg Collaborative, an international group of 15,000 surgeons reviewing the likelihood of complications from elective surgery in coronavirus cases.

Citizens will be encouraged to remain at home, and private gatherings limited to one other household and a maximum of five people.“We are now in a very, very serious situation,” Merkel said at a news conference that started just after 2:30 a.m. in Berlin. “The case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive-care beds are filling up again,” she said, adding that the number of infections must come down to allow the country’s vaccination campaign to start taking effect.Separately, Merkel said the EU shouldn’t impose a general vaccine export ban. “We must be very careful with general export bans at this stage,” she said. “Instead we will have to look very closely at supply chains.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'b68493f09e75ac03a1303a86b19d960e', 'title': 'How Trump Almost Sabotaged the U.S. Postal Service’s Operation Santa', 'description': 'What a year to be making a film about the United States Postal Service.I’d like to say I planned this whole thing—directing a movie about a little ~~~~ known USPS program called Operation Santa in a year when they became the center of a political maelstrom. But I had no idea what 2020 would bring when we shot the film in the four weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas last year.Dear Santa centers on the USPS, an institution that seemed at points this year to hold our democracy in the balance. As 2020 got underway and we were in full throttle with post-production, we would read the headlines about the political machinations driving events at the USPS, with President Trump confessing to withholding federal aid for the USPS in order to sabotage mail-in voting, but our focus was on something more durable and timeless: the hundreds of thousands of letters that get sent directly to Santa each year and what the postal service does with them.‘The Postman’ Kevin Costner Thinks Trump’s Post Office Meddling Is ‘Criminal’Yes, there are all the trappings of your favorite family Christmas film in Dear Santa… cute kids, the emotional wants and needs of people, and lots of magic and whimsy to go around. But at the heart of this film are the dozens of USPS workers who spend their busiest time of the year not only doing their jobs, but also helping families in need. This program has lived under the radar for 108 years. Focusing on it this year seems extra poignant, as many of the USPS employees have gone the extra mile for us in the pandemic while the organization is being used as a political football.USPS employees have been on the frontlines of the pandemic since its onset, resulting in more than 10,000 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths within the organization. It was not lost on me and my crew that while we were editing our film in the safety of our homes, the USPS employees that so graciously let us into their world over the holidays were both risking their health and fighting just to do their jobs. They were politicized at every turn and suffering because of it. Still, every day they worked to get us our mail, our prescriptions, and our endless Amazon packages as we quietly worked on Dear Santa.Throughout the last hundred years that Operation Santa has been active our nation has seen many dark times. I would say 2020 rivals any of these dark periods. One in eight families don’t have enough to eat. We have more than 3.5 million people out of work. We have more than 260,000 people dead from COVID-19. That’s 260,000 families in mourning right now. We have millions of people struggling to celebrate this holiday season. Compared to last year, more letters are coming into Santa this time around.As part of making this film, USPS gave me unfettered access to Operation Santa. We were given access to read the thousands of letters that came into the USPS and then were able to follow the most compelling ones.As far as how the program works, once the letters addressed to Santa come in to the USPS they are funneled to a special team that handles them. Santa “approved” this program back in 1912, telling Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock that he was authorized to allow postal employees and citizens to help him respond to letters. This meeting more than 100 years ago became what is known today as Operation Santa.Today many cities have lead elves (who are of course approved by Santa). These lead elves help all those who want to take part and adopt letters. In our film, you will meet the lead elves in New York City, Chicago, Chico, California, and Pearce, Arizona.Several years ago Santa decided to go digital due to the volume of letters. The mailroom elves, who you meet in the film, digitize the letters so that anyone anywhere can adopt a letter. This modernization of the program will help out greatly this year while we are all at home because of COVID-19. Once the letters go live, anyone can read and adopt the Operation Santa letters right from their couch.Reading the letters that come in to Santa was a profound experience for me. It is a very personal look into the psyche of our country, with many letters from young people, but also older people too. We can read about their hopes and dreams as well as their wants and needs. It really hammers home how many people are in need in America.The mission of the program has always been to provide the public with the chance to be an elf and help children and families to have a magical holiday when otherwise they might not. Helping Santa answer all of his letters might seem like a small gesture, but this is a pay-it-forward program that is propelled by many postal employees—in their off-hours—who earn modest salaries and still give back. As one of the elves in our film says, “It’s not what you have that matters but what you do with what you have.” USPS workers are and have been making little gestures in the name of Christmas cheer over the years that add up to a humongous operation and show of goodwill that is showcased in our life-affirming film.Some might say that Dear Santa is a puff piece for the USPS that is conveniently timed when they needed it most. But I say this little-known story has been right under our noses for decades and no one had asked for permission to document it until 2018, when I sent an email to their press office for access.To kick off the production of our film I was invited to USPS headquarters in Washington, D.C., last fall. I received a download of all things Operation Santa and USPS history. It was there that our hosts told us about the simple mission of their organization, “To bind the nation.” I have to admit I thought it was a little hokey at the time. A year later and after all that we have been through as a country, I one hundred percent feel their mission and have watched firsthand, as we all have, that in good times and hard times USPS delivers. In a year that has broken so much of our country in half, everyday when I walk around my neighborhood and see their trucks still chugging along, I know it hasn’t broken one of our country’s most important institutions—the USPS.Dear Santa will be released Dec. 4 nationwide anywhere that you rent or buy movies. Watch the film and then become an elf. We promise this is a restorative and empowering way to end a year that has been so difficult for so many of us.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'b9cfc54e9879f925798256afab11bed0', 'title': 'How to stop glasses from fogging up while wearing a mask in winter', 'description': 'As the coronavirus pandemic persists across the world, wearing face masks has become the new normal. Glasses wearers, however, have had to adapt to the dreaded consequence of wearing a mask and glasses at the same time: The lenses fog up. And outside in the cold weather, that nuisance is amplified.When hot air hits a cold surface -- in this case, the wearer\'s breath hitting the lenses of the glasses -- condensation forms on the surface. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the effect can happen easily, just from walking into a warm building after being in the cold outdoors while wearing glasses.When wearing a mask, the condensation is seemingly inescapable because the hot air from a person\'s breath is only able to escape upwards into the glasses."Since condensation is a function of temperature, the colder the glasses the more the condensation," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Bob Smerbeck said. "One thing you can do is try to warm up your glasses before entering a building -- but watch where you are walking. Scratches and smudges can increase condensation, so make sure your glasses are clean."Gov. Tim Walz\'s glasses fog up as he wears a mask during a news conference inside the Department of Public Safety in St. Paul, Minn., on Thursday, April 30, 2020. (Evan Frost/Minnesota Public Radio via AP, Pool)While the issue of glasses and masks is a new one for many people, one group has been dealing with it for a long time -- medical workers.Neysa Ernst, a nurse manager in the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, said that fogging glasses have always been an issue for people who work in the medical field, and plenty of solutions have been tried to neutralize the nuisance.If contact lenses are out of the question, here are a few cheap and easy ways to put an end to foggy glasses.Ernst does not wear glasses to work herself, but a handful of the nurses she works with do, and they have come up with a simple and accessible solution using a common household item."Some of the staff has talked about using Dawn dish soap, and cleaning their glasses with Dawn dish soap," Ernst told AccuWeather.Ernst said she has never tried it herself, but has heard of the solution multiple times across her staff.CLICK HERE FOR THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APPAccording to AARP, the Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England published an article in 2011 that explains how the soap and water method can prevent fogging."Immediately before wearing a face mask, wash the spectacles with soapy water and shake off the excess,"\xa0the researchers wrote. "Then, let the spectacles air dry or gently dry off the lenses with a soft tissue before putting them back on. Now the spectacle lenses should not mist up when the face mask is worn."Another common household item -- shaving cream -- has also been called a solution to foggy lenses. According to Fitz Frames, shaving cream is a great moisture repellent and can create a barrier against any condensation forming on the lenses of a pair of glasses, as well as other glass surfaces prone to fogging, such as your car windshield.AccuWeather tried the method with shaving butter, shaving gel and shaving cream products, which involved dabbing some shaving cream on the lenses and then wiping with a dry towel. The results were mixed, but largely disappointing.The original shaving cream formula did not work well, and within a few minutes, the glasses had fogged up. The shaving butter formula also did not work at all. The shaving gel reduced fogging, but not entirely. The condensation on the glasses was less thick with the gel than without any product at all. This method may be better for making your glasses smell nice than to actually defog them.A woman\'s eyeglasses are fogged up as she wears a face mask in cold, winter weather during the coronavirus outbreak. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)If you are willing to invest a little bit of money into a solution, anti-fogging sprays and wipes may do the trick. Online, the products are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased for under $10. They can typically last long enough to require being used only once daily for the desired results against light fogging.Edward Johnston, a registered nurse at Johns Hopkins University Hospital, uses Fog Gone spray, which can be purchased on Amazon or Etsy for $10-20, depending on the size of the bottle. He said he just sprays the Fog Gone on his face shield at work, waits for it to dry a little and then wipes it off. The product lasts a few days for him. Johnston told AccuWeather that he thinks Fog Gone is more effective than the dish soap trick, although some of his co-workers choose to use the soap method anyway. He said he has also heard of someone using Pam cooking spray as a solution. (AccuWeather didn\'t test out that method.)"Everyone comes up with their own tricks of the trade so to speak," Johnston said. "I was on a disaster team and we had gas masks, and I used something similar to [Fog Gone] on the gas mask we were given."If all else fails, using tape to hold down the mask could be a last resort. Sports tape or medical tape can be used as a last-ditch effort to prevent fogging by holding the mask down against the nose and cheeks to cut off the hot air from inside the mask from rising into the glasses. If you are going to attempt this method, only use tape that is designed to go on skin, not duct tape. There are even some options of tape made specifically for sensitive skin, as well."It\'s whatever works for you," Johnston said of the many available methods. "If it works for you, use it."No matter what the solution, Ernst emphasized the importance of wearing a mask during the pandemic.She explained that officials at the hospital perform contact tracing whenever a staff member is infected, and when personal protective equipment is used properly, very few infections are transmitted from patients to staff."Whatever you can put between you and the bug, you want to do that," Johnston advised.Keep checking back on\xa0AccuWeather.com\xa0and stay tuned to the\xa0AccuWeather Network on DirecTV, Frontier and Verizon Fios.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

It&#39;s now got the world&#39;s third-highest number of infections.               That distinction may pile pressure on leader Jair Bolsonaro.               He&#39;s continued to call for a rollback of quarantines arguing that business must stay open, fearing the toll on the economy, and defied advice from health officials.               He&#39;s fired one Health Minister, and the second one quit, after just weeks in the job.               Sao Paulo&#39;s Governor Joao Doria has again raised his voice, calling for urgent action:               &quot;We have to beat this (economic) crisis but to beat this crisis we have to beat coronavirus. I repeat, the enemy of the economy is not quarantine, it is the pandemic.&quot;               Meanwhile on the streets, some people are out as normal, exercising right outside makeshift hospitals including one outside Rio de Janiero&#39;s iconic Maracana stadium.               Rio doesn&#39;t have a mandatory stay-at-home order, only quarantine recommendations and some restrictions on businesses.               But some like local Margarida Serqueira worry over the lack of measures.               &quot;Brazil is in a bad state and is behind (in coronavirus response). Lockdown should have been done a long time back.&quot;               The health crisis is being felt not just in capital cities, but is also spreading fast among indigenous people in the furthest reaches of the Amazon.               Critical patients are now being airlifted out of remote areas to the only intensive care units in the vast state of Amazonas.               Doctor Edson Santos Rodrigues explains:               &quot;Cases are going up inside the Amazon, We have brought in up to four, six, up to eight (coronavirus) patients per day.&quot;               While Bolsonaro&#39;s supporters have showed their loud support in biweekly demonstrations, one recent survey pointed to a fall in President Bolsonaro&#39;s popularity with 43 percent of participants saying they thought he was doing a &#39;bad or terrible job&#39; a tumble from 31 percent in January.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'c0b7da08b82327c588c01bf251ac5d65', 'title': "Yes, customers do like it when waiters and hairdressers wear a mask – especially if it's black", 'description': "The authors didn't examine diners' perceptions of polka-dot masks specifically. AP Photo/Ringo H.W. ChiuThe Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work. The big idea Customers perceive a better quality of service, feel less anxious and exhibit more trust in businesses when waiters and other service workers wear a mask, according to a new study we just submitted for peer review. And we found this to be especially true when the mask was black. We surveyed about 4,500 Americans through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, showing each of them a random picture of a service employee, with or without a mask, in either a grocery store, bank, hair salon, hotel or restaurant. We included photos of men and women who were either Black, white or Asian. Further, the masks were in one of five color schemes: white, black, blue, multi-colored or clear. We then asked participants to record their impressions of the service workers and subsequent perceptions, emotions and behavior. We found that customers consistently expected higher quality of service from workers who wore masks compared to employees who weren’t wearing face coverings. We also found that participants tended to become less anxious when they saw a service person with a mask. Interestingly, we found that the color of the mask worn made a difference. People who wore black masks got the highest ratings, followed by white, multi-colored and blue. The clear mask – even though it allows customers to actually see facial expressions – was rated the lowest by respondents. While we didn’t ask participants about their political leanings, we did learn where they reside. And we found that those based in the West had the most positive reaction to mask-wearing, followed, in order, by people in the Southwest, Northeast, Southeast and Midwest. We found no meaningful differences in terms of the respondents’ age, race or educational level. These are six of the pictures that participants in the survey randomly saw. CC BY Why it matters President Joe Biden’s first acts as president included requiring masks be worn on all federal property and on planes and trains, and most businesses already expect their employees to wear face coverings while working. While the primary reason for this is to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus and protect workers, little is known about how mask-wearing can affect customer perceptions of service quality. Wearing a mask in Asian cultures has been a socially accepted practice for years. In the United States, however, wearing a mask became common only last year as the pandemic worsened in the spring. The practice remains controversial among some people who claim it violates their civil liberties or isn’t actually effective, though health officials have consistently endorsed their use. Although there have been many reports of altercations when workers asked a customer to wear a mask, our research shows most people appreciate it when waiters and hairdressers cover their own faces. What’s next We plan to also study other effects of wearing masks. For example, are the perceptions of service staff members affected when customers and fellow employees wear a mask or not? What’s the impact on a customer if a mask carries a logo of a company or branding message? Do servers who wear masks receive higher tips? [You’re smart and curious about the world.

Three months later the country has lost almost 100,000 more lives Coronavirus patients in a field hospital set up inside a sports coliseum in Santo André, on the outskirt of São Paulo, Brazil, on 4 March. Photograph: André Penner/AP It was midway through February when André Machado realized Brazil’s coronavirus catastrophe was racing into a bewildering and remorseless new phase. “The floodgates opened and the water came gushing out,” recalled the infectious disease specialist from the Our Lady of the Conception hospital in Porto Alegre, one of the largest cities in southern Brazil. Since then, Machado’s hospital, like health centres up and down the country, has been engulfed by a deluge of jittery, gasping patients – many of them previously healthy and bafflingly young. Among the recent admissions was a heavily pregnant 37-year-old who was brought in complaining of breathing difficulties and a cough. Doctors performed an emergency C-section to deliver the baby in a desperate bid to take the pressure off the expectant mother’s Covid-racked lungs. “We’re trying to help people but this disease is much faster and more aggressive than the tactics we’ve been using,” Machado, 44, said of his team’s efforts to keep pace with a tripling of admissions. “It’s like we’re flogging a dead horse,” he said, before adding: “This disease is going to kill many more people in Brazil.” At the end of last year Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro – a Donald Trump-worshiping populist who has gleefully sabotaged Covid containment efforts – declared his country had reached “the tail end” of what was already one of the world’s worst outbreaks. Bolsonaro was wrong. Three months later Latin America’s largest nation has lost almost 100,000 more lives – taking its total death toll to more than 275,000, second only to the US – and been plunged into the deadliest chapter of its 13-month epidemic. Jair Bolsonaro speaks to the media in Brasília, Brazil, on 10 March. Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters This week, as a record 2,349 daily deaths were reported, the former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva castigated Bolsonaro’s “moronic” handling of the crisis and urged citizens to confront their incompetent “blowhard” leader. “This country is in a state of utter tumult and confusion because there’s no government. I’ll repeat that: this country has no government,” Lula declared, blaming Bolsonaro’s “uncivilised” leadership and rejection of science for the scale of Brazil’s disaster. “So, so many lives could have been saved,” Lula claimed, warning: “Covid is taking over the country.” As the emergency intensified this week, frontline health workers from Porto Alegre to Recife, a coastal city 3,000km further north, described scenes of heartbreak, despair and exhaustion as intensive care units and cemeteries fill up like never before. Workers bury a person who died with Covid in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, on 27 January. Photograph: Raphael Alves/EPA “It feels like we’re putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” said Eduarda Santa Rosa Barata, a 31-year-old infectologist who works in three ICUs in the north-eastern capital of Pernambuco state, all now stretched to the limit. “We’re engaged in damage reduction … You open new beds and they fill up immediately.” A few days earlier, Barata had admitted a 37-year-old man who had no underlying medical conditions but whose lungs were so badly damaged he needed intubation. “It seems so random,” she said. “It’s a bizarre disease. It’s frightening.” Machado saw several explanations for the torrent of cases he and other doctors are now seeing, including political mismanagement and the slackening of social distancing measures, principally among the young. In recent months such containment efforts have largely collapsed, with schools and businesses reopening and Bolsonaro’s tourism minister even urging citizens to start holidaying again. But the doctor suspected a third, more troubling element was also at work: an enigmatic and apparently more contagious variant called P1 that is thought to have emerged in the Amazon region in late 2020 but is now circulating across Brazil, including in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, where Machado works. People walk in a shopping center in São Paulo, Brazil, on 4 March. Photograph: Cris Faga/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock “This isn’t just theoretical. It’s something we’re seeing in practice,” Machado said of the variant, at least 10 cases of which have been detected in the UK and 15 in the US. “Before the end of 2020, you’d get a family and one member would be infected but not the other three or four members, even though they lived in the same environment. You don’t see this any more. If there’s one confirmed case, everyone ends up getting infected by the virus,” he said. “It’s obvious that this new variant is now circulating among us.” Just how much of Brazil’s current crisis is down to the new variant, or other variants traced to the UK and South Africa, is a matter of intense debate. Some experts believe the variant has provided a convenient smokescreen for political leaders who have failed to rein in a disease President Bolsonaro has dismissed as a “little flu”. As he ordered a two-week emergency shutdown in Brazil’s most populous state on Thursday, the São Paulo governor, João Doria, claimed the variant played a key role in pushing hospitals to the brink. “This new strain of the virus is very aggressive and very dangerous,” Doria warned, claiming Brazil was “collapsing” under the weight of the surge in cases. Jesem Orellana, an epidemiologist from the Amazon city of Manaus, where hospitals recently ran out of oxygen as a result of the explosion of infections, was unconvinced mutations were the main culprit. “From a political point of view, it’s much easier to place the blame on the variant. But we all know that the worst variant of all is the way the epidemic has been mishandled,” he said. Orellana suspected that having failed to halt coronavirus with unpopular and economically painful lockdowns, politicians at all levels of government were now “using the variant as a crutch to prop themselves up and to justify their mistakes and their negligence over the epidemic”.

Photograph: Diego Vara/Reuters But Marcos Boulos, a leading infectious disease specialist, said he had no doubt the P1 variant was contributing to Brazil’s soaring caseload: “There’s no way of hiding this.” Boulos also said anecdotal evidence from hospitals around Brazil suggested the variant was also producing more serious cases in young people. “We don’t yet have the data to categorically affirm this but it’s possible, from what doctors are seeing,” said the University of São Paulo professor. “Here in the hospital we’ve got a 20-year-old woman in our ICU in serious condition. Today you have serious patients in ICU from all age groups. Before we’d say it was almost 90% elderly. Today they’re still the majority, but not in same way,” Boulos added. “We don’t yet know how this works, but it’s what we are seeing … There’s no other reason why young people would suddenly start suffering from a more serious disease.” São Paulo’s health secretary, Jean Gorinchteyn, this week told reporters that in many of that state’s ICUs half of patients were now under 50. “I’m talking about 26 and 29 and 30-year-olds – often in a very grave condition,” he said, urging citizens to avoid crowds and remain at home. “We all need to understand that what is happening right now is a different pandemic from the one we saw last year,” Gorinchteyn claimed. Barata said she also had the impression that her Covid patients were getting younger, and reaching hospital in a worse condition. Despite having been immunised with the Chinese-produced CoronaVac vaccine in February, she admitted feeling more fearful now than during the previous peak last June. “It feels like every day the virus draws nearer … Everywhere you look around you, you can say there’s someone who has symptoms, or who is sick, or in hospital … The mother-in-law of one of my colleagues is in critical condition in intensive care,” she said. Barata said she was uncertain what, if any, role new variants were playing in Brazil’s latest misfortune, but whatever – or whoever – was responsible, she feared the human tragedy was far from over: “It feels like the disease is laying siege to us, closing in and infecting everyone who hasn’t yet caught it.” Machado said that after the delivery of her 36-week-old baby, the expectant mother and her child were rushed to intensive care, where the former was put on a ventilator. “We don’t know if she’ll make it,” he admitted last week as the hospital’s Covid-19 wards reached the brink of collapse and fears grew over the global impact of Brazil’s unchecked epidemic. Twenty-four hours later, at 10 minutes past midnight, the woman was gone, leaving five orphaned children and a country in disarray.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

A source knowledgeable of the study told Reuters on Friday that the data indicates that the vaccine will not need to be modified in order to protect against the variant also known as P1, which is believed to have originated in the Amazonian city of Manaus.Last month, South Africa paused the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the country after early results indicated that it was less effective against the South African variant, which is similar to P1. The source did not provide the exact efficacy of the vaccine against the Brazilian variant, but said the full results of the study should be released soon, possibly in March.The promising information comes as a small-sample study suggested that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac may not work effectively against the Brazilian variant.Brazil is currently confronting a brutal and long-lasting second wave of the coronavirus, hitting a daily record of more than 1900 deaths on Wednesday.The P1 variant is among the factors that epidemiologists believe is contributing to a rise in cases and deaths there, with concern in the scientific community about the variant's resistance to vaccines.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'ddafcbeef2e6b5d955a618f5a6ee6e26', 'title': 'Two Masks Are the New Masks', 'description': 'Many of us who watched the inauguration last week were delighted by the fashion on display — the colorful matching coat and mask ensembles worn by the first lady, Jill Biden; and the Biden granddaughters; the power purple worn by Vice President Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton; and of course, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ delightful mittens made of recycled wool sweaters. But the fashion trend that most excited me was the double mask! Double-masking is a sensible and easy way to lower your risk, especially if circumstances require you to spend more time around others — like in a taxi, on a train or plane, or at an inauguration. Pete Buttigieg, the former presidential candidate and now the nominee for secretary of transportation, was spotted double-masking. It appears he was wearing a high-quality medical mask underneath a black cloth mask. His husband, Chasten, was sporting a similar double-masked look but with a fashionable plaid cloth mask that coordinated with his winter scarf. We should all be thinking about the quality of our masks right now. New variants of the coronavirus continue to emerge, and one in particular is cause for pressing concern in the United States because it’s so contagious and spreading fast. I wrote about the steps you can take to better protect yourself. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The bottom line is that you should keep taking the same pandemic precautions you always have, but do a little better. The new variant spreading in the United States appears to latch onto our cells more efficiently. The mutation in the virus may mean it could take less virus and less time in the same room with an infected person for someone to become ill. People infected with the variant may also shed larger quantities of virus, which increases the risk to people around them. That’s why the quality of your mask is more important than ever. You can read about the latest research urging a well-fitted two- or three-layer mask. Or you can keep the masks you’ve been using and just double-mask when you go to the store or find yourself spending time with people from outside your household. One big advantage of double-masking that I’ve found is that it creates a better fit and closes the gaps around the edge of your mask. I like layering my masks. When I walk the dog or exercise outdoors, I wear a regular mask to comply with area mask rules. When I want more protection for short errands, I wear a better mask. When I’m in a taxi or on a train, I double-mask. I’ve just bought a new set of masks called KF94s that I really like. They fit well, have added flaps to close gaps around the face and include a moldable band to tighten the fit around the bridge of the nose. Now I wear a KF94, a type of mask made in South Korea that can be purchased easily online, covered by a cloth mask. I recently learned about the KF94 from Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. Jha notes that the gold-standard N95 masks are still hard to find, and we should save them for health workers. The KF94 mask resembles an N95, with some differences. It’s made of a similar nonwoven material that blocks 94% of the hardest-to-trap viral particles. But the KF94 has ear loops, instead of elastic head bands, so it won’t fit as snugly as an N95 — although double-masking can help close any gaps. The KF94 is also disposable — you can buy a pack of 20 for about $40 on Amazon. While you can let a KF94 mask air dry and reuse it several times, it can’t be laundered and won’t last as long as a cloth mask. One solution is to save your KF94 mask for higher-risk situations — like riding a subway, spending time in a store or going to a doctor’s appointment.

The disclosure provided a rare look at how the COVID-19 has impacted workers at a major U.S. employer.                The 19,000 infected works out to about 1.4 percent of Amazon&#39;s frontline workforce, which includes employees at Whole Foods, which it bought in 2017.               The numbers were revealed as Amazon repeatedly comes under fire from staff, elected officials and unions, which claim the company put employees&#39; health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic.               The figure includes seasonal staff and those who may have been infected outside work.               Amazon is calling on other business to report figures as well, saying in a blogpost that company data on infection rates could help states make decisions on when to reopen public spaces and could also help employers decide if and when to bring people back to work.               The online retail giant says it will expand virus testing to 50,000 employees per day by November.               Increased testing coincides with the kick-off of the busiest time of the year. It will try to jumpstart the holiday shopping season with Prime Day - a day filled with promises of deep discounts. The annual event was pushed back on the calendar this year from July to mid-October due to the pandemic.               Amazon has seen its sales soar through the roof during the health crisis. Net sales during the March to June period hit nearly $90 billion and analysts predict it took in another $92 billion in sales in the just ended quarter.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'e93071b87d504d5987e00a036d77bb8f', 'title': 'Traveling? Be Prepared to Quarantine', 'description': 'Although the number of air travelers topped 1 million on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, many Americans opted not to travel for the holiday. (The equivalent number a year ago, 2019\'s biggest travel day, was more than 2.8 million). But even as coronavirus cases continue to surge, the winter holidays and breaks from school may have more people contemplating taking some time away from home in the coming weeks.Making that choice could require you to quarantine both before you leave and once you get back (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated its quarantine guidance, suggesting a seven-day quarantine followed by a negative test or a 10-day quarantine without testing if a person does not develop symptoms).Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIf you\'re contemplating a trip, here\'s what to think about before you leave.Check your state\'s travel restrictions.State travel regulations aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus are changing by the day.As of Dec. 4, California is encouraging domestic travelers arriving in the state to quarantine for two weeks. Massachusetts is requiring residents returning from almost every state to complete a form before arrival and quarantine for two weeks afterward. Those who arrive with a negative result from a COVID-19 test administered up to 72 hours before entering the state can forgo quarantine. Travelers who fail to comply may face a $500 fine per day.New York requires a 14-day quarantine for those who leave the state for more than 24 hours and are returning from states and territories that are not contiguous with New York or from certain high-risk countries. Travelers can "test out" of the quarantine if they receive a negative test result within three days before their return, quarantine for three days upon arrival plus take another test on the fourth day that comes back negative.Even if your state doesn\'t have such requirements, Dr. Lin Chen, the president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and the travel clinic director at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass., said it\'s safest to take tests before and after a trip. If you\'re flying, you may get infected in transit. Plus, about 40% of people who test positive for the virus may never show symptoms, Chen said, and tests aren\'t always reliable."I would still want everybody to be careful and take all the precautions," she added. "It doesn\'t mean that with a negative test, one should take off the mask."If you will have to take a test upon returning from your trip, the Department of Health and Human Services website has a list of testing sites in each state.Find out your employer\'s requirements.Employers can take certain precautions to keep their workplaces safe during the pandemic. If you have been working in a shared workplace and are traveling, ask your company what is expected of you upon returning. (Some companies may even ask their employees not to travel at all if it isn\'t essential.)According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an employer may ask its employees to stay home until it\'s clear they don\'t have the coronavirus if they have traveled to certain locations flagged by the CDC or local health officials. New Hampshire, for instance, encourages employers to ask employees if they have made any nonessential trips outside of the state and a few surrounding states. Employees who have must quarantine at home for two weeks before returning to work. They can cut that period short if, on their seventh day back, they are asymptomatic and take a test that comes back negative.Ask your employer if post-travel quarantine would fall under paid sick leave. You may be eligible for it under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, an emergency measure passed in March by the federal government. But the act covers only two weeks of paid sick leave to eligible employees, and it may be of better use in the event that you contract the virus. Thirteen states and Washington, D.C., have laws that require paid sick leave for eligible employees, but you should research whether quarantine qualifies for paid leave under those specific laws.If you have to return to work immediately after your trip and don\'t have the option of telecommuting, you may want to consider canceling your plans. Similarly, if your children have been attending school in person, check if they will be allowed back in the classroom if you travel.Secure essentials ...If you will have to quarantine for two weeks after your trip, stock up on groceries, hygiene products and other essentials before traveling (and be aware that some retailers are putting limits on items that proved hard to get during the early days of the pandemic, like toilet paper and paper towels). It never hurts to have plenty of shelf staples in your kitchen. If you can secure an advance delivery time, set up deliveries with online services like Instacart, Shipt or AmazonFresh to have groceries delivered from local stores upon your return. Or use food delivery apps like Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats, which are available in hundreds of cities.... and entertainment.Think of how you\'re going to unwind and fight off cabin fever. Plenty of classic holiday movies, including "It\'s a Wonderful Life" and "Elf," are available to stream online.While the internet offers no shortage of shows, movies, TikTok videos and the like, you may want to have analog distractions to get a break from screens. Order a few books online that can greet you at your doorstep when you return. Buy puzzles to solve with your whole family. Children may enjoy creating holiday-themed arts and crafts projects -- order kits ahead of time. And board games like Risk and Dungeons & Dragons can keep you busy for hours.During the pandemic, Kristin Addis, the chief executive of Be My Travel Muse, a company that helps women travel solo, has quarantined at home in Nevada a few times after visiting French Polynesia, Mexico and Aruba. She passed the time by practicing yoga and Pilates and video chatting with friends and family. "I kind of do the things that I did during lockdown to stay sane," she said.Have a contingency plan.Know what to do in case you contract the virus during your trip. Will you be able to extend your Airbnb or hotel and reschedule any transportation that involves being with other people? If you\'re sharing a household with others and fall ill, self-isolate in one room and have someone leave your meals and other essentials outside your door. If you have the option, designate one bathroom to yourself.If you don\'t have enough room to self isolate during the entire quarantine period, the CDC recommends separating from others as much as possible. Always maintain six feet of distance, disinfect shared surfaces, such as kitchen counters and bathroom sinks, and open the windows to circulate fresh air. If you have to share a bedroom with someone else, the CDC suggests placing a divider such as a shower curtain or quilt between you and the other person, and sleeping in inverse directions. Caregivers should also quarantine for two weeks after the ill person ends self-isolation.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'f33fe53a83195d6c26f3626c34725861', 'title': 'Outdoor Dining Is a Hit. What About Outdoor Shopping?', 'description': 'NEW YORK -- Hoping to survive the economic toll of the pandemic, nearly 11,000 restaurants are now part of New York City\'s outdoor dining program -- a program so wildly popular that Mayor Bill de Blasio made it permanent.With that kind of success, the mayor turned his attention to another popular activity: shopping. In late October, he announced the Open Storefronts program, which allows retailers to use their sidewalk space to conduct business outdoors.But so far, the program is a dud: As of Tuesday morning, only 563 businesses had applied. De Blasio has said 40,000 businesses are eligible to participate.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThere was a lot going against it. Business owners said the program was complicated, costly and too little, too late. It was scheduled to end Dec. 31. Only 10 businesses on Staten Island had applied, and most applicants were in Brooklyn and Manhattan.Some business owners said they were turned off by the rules, including space restrictions and a prohibition on heaters, a primary draw for outdoor dining as the weather grows colder. Others said they could not afford to pay employees to stand outside in the cold to watch over merchandise.Several store owners said that unlike outdoor dining, the customer demand was not there."People have to eat, they have to socialize, but they don\'t necessarily have to buy clothes," said Liz Murphy, the owner of Slope Vintage in Brooklyn.At a City Council hearing Tuesday, Jonnel Doris, commissioner for the city\'s Department of Small Business Services, largely blamed an information gap and concerns about the transmission of the virus for the low participation rate.Doris said small businesses receive a majority of their sales during the holiday shopping season, so his team was working to increase the number of participants.A spokesperson for the mayor, Mitch Schwartz, said in a statement that the city was "proud" to see that some businesses were taking advantage of the program."Two things have been clear throughout this pandemic: Small businesses need support, and New York City\'s recovery depends on creative uses of the outdoor urban landscape," he said. "Open Storefronts merges both."But using the landscape does not mean businesses will recover, some store owners said.Murphy said she put two racks of clothing in front of her store this summer before the mayor unveiled Open Storefronts. Her sidewalk setup increased foot traffic but did not increase her sales. She said she did not see the value.Outdoor retail "isn\'t going to save the company," said Murphy, who did not apply to the program. "It\'s not going to make my sales go up 20%. All it\'s going to do is say to someone, \'Hey, we\'re open,\' but I could\'ve just gotten a neon sign for the same amount of money that would\'ve attracted the same number of people."While the program is wide-ranging -- including clothing and food stores and repair shops but also personal care services and even laundromats and dry cleaners -- many retailers failed to see how it made sense for their business."The customer experience of visiting stores on Fifth Avenue is exceptional and based on what we know about our shoppers\' habits," Jerome Barth, president of the Fifth Avenue Association, said in an email. "They prefer the personal touch of walking into a store and enjoying that special degree of care."Still, some business owners were hopeful, willing to try anything to stay afloat. With the holiday shopping season underway, retailers are increasingly anxious about recouping losses incurred during the pandemic. According to a report by the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit business group, approximately one-third of the city\'s 240,000 small businesses may not survive the pandemic.Some store owners began moving their wares to the sidewalk earlier this year as lockdown limitations lifted but people remained concerned about enclosed spaces. They made these changes before the city consented, leaving themselves open to receiving tickets or fines."The Open Storefronts initiative was more of a validation of something businesses had initiated themselves out of desperation," said Kenneth Mbonu, executive director of the Flatbush Nostrand Junction Business Improvement District in South Brooklyn.Sidewalk vending, legal or not, has long been a familiar sight throughout the city and is considered a quick and often cheap way to make sales: jewelry in SoHo, incense in Harlem, flowers in midtown. But extending a brick-and-mortar business onto the sidewalk is rarer.Khadija Tudor, who owns Life Wellness Center, a massage and acupuncture studio and apothecary in Brooklyn, has been selling merchandise outside without having heard of Open Storefronts.In 2006, when she and her husband opened the business, they would drag a massage chair to the sidewalk and offer it to passersby, or have a table with plants and incense for sale. During the pandemic, they left the massage chair inside, but the area outside the storefront is bustling.Tudor said sidewalk merchandise, like lush bunches of eucalyptus and sizable house plants, had always helped business. "But it\'s not just outdoor sales. A big thing for us is being connected to the community," she said. "We really consider community to be the backbone of why we\'re even surviving and thriving."The stretch of Tompkins Avenue was particularly lively on a recent November afternoon, full of outdoor diners and shoppers. Two more retail businesses also had wares on the sidewalk; one had clothing snaked up the scaffolding outside the shop.Annie\'s Blue Ribbon General Store, also in Brooklyn, happens to be on one of the city\'s "open streets," which are closed to traffic at certain times. Bars and restaurants had been taking advantage of the additional space all summer, so when Ann Cantrell, the store\'s owner, heard about the retail program, she jumped at the chance to apply."I just want to remain relevant and top of mind for our customers," Cantrell said. Being outside "increases awareness and opportunity to be closer to the customer."Doing business outdoors helped salvage the Craft Studio, a Manhattan arts studio, not because of sales but because Lindsey Peers, the owner, moved art classes and activities to the sidewalk. That meant caregivers and children could still participate in classes.Ashley Butterman, a regular at the Upper East Side location, stopped taking her two young children when the pandemic took hold. Once the sidewalk classes began, she eagerly returned, happy to have found a way for her children to have play dates without having to enter a building."It provided a great way for us to benefit from all the things they do here and to support a local business but also stay safe and comfortable," she said.Although the sidewalk classes were successful in the summer, Peers said she thought she would get only one or two days of sidewalk sales in before the end of the year, even though she went through the formal application process."I know I\'m not alone when I say it\'s a staffing issue," she said. "To have a person stationed outside all day and to make up for that revenue -- it\'s a gamble."Many store owners are avoiding the program entirely. Representatives from business improvement districts in Manhattan\'s Chinatown, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg and SoHo and on the Upper East Side and Madison Avenue all said that it was too soon to read the success of the program because of the low rates of participation.DianSong Yu, executive director of the Downtown Flushing Transit Hub Business Improvement District, said the program was not successful in his Queens neighborhood."One, local retailers are facing major competition from online retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Target," he wrote in an email. "Two, to operate outdoor retail, shops will have to hire more employees for the coverage. A risk most shop owners are not willing to take on. Three, Main Street is occupied by illegal vendors throughout the day. Tough competition for retailers."But others thought that more businesses would enroll in the program during the holiday season."I think it will slowly gain traction," said Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corp., a neighborhood group. He expressed excitement about the potential of community gathering, likening outdoor shopping to neighborhood front porches."In the old days, you never knew if someone was inside," Chen said. "But now you see them. You engage with each other. You smell the fresh air. People are saying that even after the pandemic the program should continue, and rightfully so."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Aruk� Juma, who died on Wednesday aged between 86 and 90, was the last Juma man left from a tribe that once numbered 15,000. Repeated massacres in the 20th century meant that by 2002, just five Juma people were left � Mr Juma, his three daughters and a grandchild. Brazil�s indigenous groups are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 because of their isolation, communal way of life and poor healthcare provisions. At the beginning of the pandemic, many indigenous groups sought to cut themselves off from the outside world by closing roads and turning away visitors. Those efforts failed, however, and the virus is now widespread among indigenous communities, with almost 49,000 cases and 969 deaths and 162 tribes affected, according to Government figures. Part of the blame may lie with the federal indigenous health service, known as Sesai. According to the Emergencia Indigena campaign, in at least three regions the virus was introduced by infected Sesai workers, while a New York Times investigation last year uncovered over a thousand infections among Sesai officials who were forced to work without adequate protective equipment or access to enough tests. Indigenous groups, many of whom remain officially �uncontacted�, also face threats from the encroachment of miners and agricultural businesses, which have grown worse under the populist, Right-wing government of president Jair Bolsonaro. As a teenager in the 1960s, Mr Juma witnessed the worst massacre of his people, when rubber tappers and tropical nut traders intruded on their land. Over 60 Juma are thought to have been killed, with just seven remaining alive. Over subsequent decades he campaigned for federal recognition for the Jumas� land, but the effort was complicated by the lack of other Juma men and his family�s decision to move in with another group, the Uru-eu-wau-wau, where his daughters married. Mr Juma�s eldest daughter, Boreh� Juma, said that she intended to follow in her father's footsteps. �I want to become like him now to fight like my father. My father was a warrior. He was chief, I was chief and now the lineage is over �, she told Amazonia Real.", 'num_of_covid': 1}
