If 17 Republican senators agree and vote to convict Trump of "inciting an insurrection," the former president will stand convicted and likely be barred from holding federal office again. The trial starts this week. Trump\'s lawyers have indicated that they plan to argue he merely "exercised his First Amendment right under the Constitution to express his belief that the election results were suspect" — an argument 144 leading First Amendment and constitutional scholars from across the political spectrum called "legally frivolous" — did not tell his supporters to violently attack the Capitol in a fiery speech right before the assault, and cannot be impeached since he is no longer in office. That last argument is popular among Senate Republicans, but top conservative constitutional lawyer Charles Cooper urged them in a new Wall Street Journal op-ed to disregard that flawed, illogical view and "judge the former president\'s misconduct on the merits." As far as the merits go, federal "court documents show that more than two dozen people charged in the attack specifically cited Trump and his calls to gather that day in describing on social media or in conversations with others why they decided to take action by coming to Washington," The Washington Post reports. "Some defense attorneys have echoed those arguments, saying that those who participated in the attack were doing so at the behest of Trump." "But for the president, they would not have walked down Pennsylvania Avenue," Al Watkins, defending "QAnon shaman" Jacob Chansley, told the Post. "They believed the president was going with them. They thought they were helping the president save our country." A.J. Kramer, chief of the Federal Public Defender\'s Office for Washington, said he expects numerous attorneys for Capitol rioters to argue that Trump "told them to march up Pennsylvania Avenue, and he\'d be leading them, and he\'s the commander in chief of the military and the nation\'s top law enforcement officer." You can read more about what Trump and the Capitol insurrectionists said before and during the assault, and preview likely legal arguments, at The Washington Post.

Few people have seen Putin in person since March, and those who are allowed into his office have to first quarantine for two weeks then walk through a tunnel that sprays a fine mist of antiseptics, Russian journalists say. But the investigative news organization Proekt reported last week that Putin\'s isolated workaholism isn\'t all that it appears.Putin, a former spy, has actually been working at an identical office set up at his residence in Sochi, a resort town and popular vacation destination on the Black Sea, Proekt reports, citing anonymous sources plus presidential plane flight logs and other circumstantial evidence. Putin\'s office denied the report, The New York Times notes. "The president has many offices and no identical offices," Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists last week, claiming that the Proekt report and other exposés about Putin\'s personal life are an "information campaign, an information attack."Opposition figure Alexei Navalny, recovering in Germany from a nerve agent poisoning believed to have been ordered by Putin, said the Proekt report about the president working at a secret duplicate office at the seashore "is absolutely Putin\'s style — to lie even in the little things." Ekaterina Schulmann, a political commentator for the Echo of Moscow radio station, said the recent spate of leaks about the personal life of Putin\'s family and inner circle are probably tied to competing factions within the government trying to embarrass rivals as their children vie for plum jobs in government and state-run corporations.More stories from theweek.com  Judge appointed by Trump heard his case to overturn Biden\'s win, wholly rejected it on the merits  The Constitution has an answer for seditious members of Congress  Trump says he made an \'adjustment\' to plan for early coronavirus vaccines at White House', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Prince Philip, 99, was admitted to the private King Edward VII\'s Hospital in Marylebone, central London, last Tuesday for a few days’ "rest and observation" after feeling unwell. While it was not an emergency admission and he walked in unaided, his stay was extended throughout the weekend. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Buckingham Palace said: "The Duke of Edinburgh remains at King Edward VII\'s Hospital, where he is receiving medical attention for an infection. He is comfortable and responding to treatment, but is not expected to leave hospital for several days." Meanwhile, the Earl of Wessex has revealed that the Royal Family are keeping their "fingers crossed" but that his father is "a lot better" after seven nights in hospital. Prince Edward, the Duke\'s youngest son, told Sky News he had talked to his father on the phone. Asked how he was doing, he said: "As far as I\'m aware, well I did speak to them the other day, so he\'s a lot better thank you very much indeed, and he\'s looking forward to getting out, which is the most positive thing. So we keep our fingers crossed." The Prince of Wales made a 200-mile round trip to visit his father on Saturday, spending half an hour at his bedside. He is understood to have updated the Duke on latest developments concerning the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Observers described him as looking sombre as he climbed into his car for the two-hour return journey to Highgrove, Gloucestershire. On Monday, the Duke of Cambridge said his grandfather was "OK", adding: "They’re keeping an eye on him." Philip is now into his eighth day at the private hospital. The 99-year-old was initially due to spend a few days under medical care for "observation and rest" for an undisclosed reason, which is not coronavirus-related. But on Friday sources said the duke, who turns 100 in June, was likely to remain in hospital into this week. Members of the royal family have continued with their duties since he was taken to hospital. The morning after Philip was admitted, Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, who have received their Covid jabs, visited the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to learn about vaccination trials. Last Thursday, the Queen carried out her first official in-person event of the year, making one of her most senior aides a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in a ceremony at Windsor Castle. Philip has been spending the latest lockdown with the Queen at Windsor, and in January they both received Covid vaccinations. The duke last had a spell in hospital in December 2019, when he was treated for a "pre-existing condition" and discharged on Christmas Eve after four nights.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Since Nov. 25, not a single fundraising email from the Trump campaign or its Republican National Committee fundraising account has featured Pence’s name in the “from” field. And this week, that Republican National Committee joint fundraising committee, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, made another subtle change: a handful of its emails swapped out the official Trump-Pence campaign logo for one featuring just the president’s name.At first blush, those may seem like minor tweaks to gimmicky portions of Team Trump’s fundraising strategy. A source familiar with the process said the fundraising emails do not go to Vice President Pence's team for clearance and an RNC official said the digital team was merely testing a new logo around the end of the month deadline. Indeed, some of the joint fundraising committee’s emails this week have included the original campaign logo with Pence’s name below Trump’s.But several high-level sources say that the graphics change, along with Pence’s disappearance from the headers of President Donald Trump’s increasingly frantic and conspiratorial pleas, are not actually coincidental. According to four people with knowledge of the matter, they reflect an effort by the vice president and his team to distance Pence from some of the president’s more outlandish claims about a conspiracy to undermine the election and illegally deny him a second term in office.“It is an open secret [in Trumpworld] that Vice President Pence absolutely does not feel the same way about the legal effort as President Trump does,” said a senior administration official. “The vice president doesn’t want to go down with this ship…and believes much of the legal work has been unhelpful.”The Trump campaign declined to comment on this story. Devin O’Malley, a spokesman for Pence, said Wednesday night, “As he has for the last four years, the Vice President is proud to stand with the president—in this case to ensure every legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is rejected. The Daily Beast’s anonymous sources have no real insight into what the Vice President thinks on these matters.”Trump Campaign Has Raised $150M Off Voter-Fraud Fiction Since ElectionThe political marriage between Trump and Pence was always based on simple tradeoff: Pence gave Trump credibility among establishment and religious types and, in exchange, shared the spoils of Trump’s far larger and more unorthodox coalition of voters. But in the aftermath of the 2020 elections, that deal has come under intense strain.As Trump has tended to his own future, Pence has preferred to place his energies on the critical Senate run-offs in Georgia. Pence, sources say, privately views the Rudy Giuliani-led legal operation to overturn the 2020 election through the mass disenfranchisement of votes as counterproductive and doomed. And, as a former governor himself, he has been particularly uncomfortable with Trump’s attacks on Republican governors in some of the key battleground states that he lost. The president has accused several GOP leaders of incompetence or negligence in their inability or unwillingness to stop the certification of their state’s election results.“Pence deeply understands the position that [Ohio Gov. Mike] DeWine, [Arizona Gov. Dave] Ducey and [Georgia Gov. Brian] Kemp are in. He has tried to be an effective mediator and communicator between those parties and the president back and forth,” said one Pence ally. “Any time he’s played that role, it’s gone well. The president is satisfied with the facts they’ve provided. And then somehow, without hours or days, the president is publicly attacking them by being fed inaccurate information from other White House sources, which frustrates the VP. It’s not a good look for the president. And it’s only created division in the party at a time when unity is very important.”The result has been a subtle but clear effort at creating political space.Rudy’s Phony Fraud Hearing in Gettysburg Debuts Trump’s Shadow GovernmentSince Election Day, Pence has walked a rhetorical tightrope as he tries to publicly back Trump’s position in general terms while avoiding the more outlandish allegations that the president frequently floats on Twitter and in his few post-election public remarks. Pence has repeatedly demanded that “every legal vote” be counted and that alleged voter fraud be rooted out.But he has studiously avoided backing Trump’s more conspiratorial allegations about election malfeasance, and declined to answer questions about his views on specific Trump statements. For example, a pool report from a November 20 rally in Georgia, where Pence campaigned on behalf of Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, noted that the vice president “did not echo the president’s rhetoric on the election being ‘rigged.’The disconnect is also evident on Pence’s Twitter feed. While the president has fervently tweeted about the supposed conspiracy against him, Pence’s tweets on the matter have been far fewer and more muted. He’s devoted far more social media space to the White House’s efforts to get a coronavirus vaccine out the door and to last month’s NASA rocket launch, which sent U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.Since November 15, Pence has tweeted just three times about supposed election irregularities. Two of those tweets were links to news stories, shared without comment, about recount and vote audit efforts in Georgia, and one simply retweeted a reporter’s quotation of Pence’s comments at that November 20 rally, where Pence declared that Trump would “keep fighting until every legal vote is counted” and “every illegal vote is thrown out.”Pence made other similarly anodyne comments in his remarks that tiptoed around the president’s allegations of widespread voter fraud. But he also repeatedly called on Georgia Republicans to “defend the majority” in the U.S. Senate—a tacit acknowledgement that, if Democrats win both Georgia Senate seats, a Vice President Kamala Harris would break the upper chamber’s 50-50 split and give her party a majority.That unspoken premise is a reality that Republican operatives and the party’s top donors have acknowledged even as the president remains obstinate.“I have not seen any evidence yet that would convince me that [the Trump legal team] will be successful in getting this to the Supreme Court or even anything to an appeals court,” Ed Rollins, a veteran GOP strategist who chairs the pro-Trump group Great America PAC, said on Wednesday. “I’m disappointed in the effort, as someone who has been around the game for a long time. I’ve seen a lot of ranting and raving from them, but not any really good legal challenges. Neither Rudy nor Sidney [Powell] nor anybody else on the team is considered a first-rate election lawyer and I don’t see any on this team.”On Wednesday, Pence went to Capitol Hill where he participated in the swearing in of Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ)—an act that implicitly conceded the validity of the elections in Arizona. Hours later, Trump put out a 46 minute long speech in which he called for the results in six battleground states, including Arizona, to be overturned and for him to remain president. Pence was not by his side.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!Daily Beast Membership: Beast Inside goes deeper on the stories that matter to you.

Today he sees 'light at the end of the tunnel.'", 'description': 'Dr. Anthony Fauci is looking back on his dire warning that the COVID-19 pandemic was about to get worse exactly one year later — and now, he\'s able to offer a far more hopeful message. During a congressional hearing one year ago on March 11, 2020, Fauci warned that "we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now" in the COVID-19 pandemic. That was also the same day that, in two back-to-back surreal pieces of news, the NBA season was suspended and Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson revealed they had contracted the coronavirus. On Good Morning America, Fauci looked back on his March 11 comments a year later, acknowledging that even back then, he couldn\'t have imagined just how much worse the pandemic would ultimately get. "Is the worse yet to come, Dr. Fauci?" "Yes it is ... Things will get worse ... Bottom line: It\'s going to get worse." -- One year ago today, #OTD March 11, 2020 pic.twitter.com/3W6rkLyM5K — Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) March 11, 2021 "I did not realize in my mind even anything close to more than half a million people having died in this country," Fauci said. Fauci also told Today that learning the current COVID-19 death toll "would have shocked me completely" a year ago, noting, "I knew we were in for trouble ... but I did not in my mind think that much worse was going to be 525,000 deaths." But with three COVID-19 vaccines rolling out around the United States, Fauci said on Today he sees "light at the end of the tunnel" and that "things look good," though at the same time, he warned that states shouldn\'t be too quick to lift COVID-19 restrictions, as "we\'ve got to keep putting our foot to the pedal when it comes to public health measures." Asked when the U.S. might see a return to normalcy, Fauci also predicted that "by the time we get into the mid-to-late summer, early fall, we\'re going to start seeing a big, big difference." “There is light at the end of the tunnel… but we’ve got to keep putting our foot to the pedal when it comes to public health measures.” -Dr. Anthony Fauci on where things stand one year into the coronavirus pandemic pic.twitter.com/Sc38EwDonZ — TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 11, 2021 More stories from theweek.comAll living ex-presidents but 1 get vaccinated in new COVID-19 PSAThe Harry and Meghan interview might have taken down more than the royal familyThe Southern Baptist Convention\'s ominous cracks', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The German health ministry said it has no such data and the reports appear to be based on a misunderstanding, adding the figure of 8 per cent in fact refers to the proportion of participants in clinical trials aged between 56 and 69.

(Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)One would assume that president-elect Joe Biden would have a smooth transition of power, considering how smoothly the rest of the election has gone, right? Just kidding. In case things weren’t doom-filled enough, enter Emily Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), who is providing the incoming Biden administration with yet another hurdle. Murphy is, in part, responsible for the Trump to Biden administrative transition, but since the election results were called on November 7, she has apparently refused to issue a letter of “ascertainment.” By doing this, Murphy is actively preventing Biden and his team to move into government offices, approve security clearance to new cabinet nominees, and allow the incoming president to be briefed on matters of national security.\xa0Murphy’s signature also pushes through 4,000 or so other political appointments, and given that many of those are in health and national security positions, her refusal to sign has stopped Biden’s team from addressing the national health crisis, despite, you know, a quarter-million Americans already dying of COVID-19 and cases surging across the country. And that might explain why her name is suddenly the topic of controversy.So who exactly is this person that has the internet seething? Emily Murphy was appointed to the lesser-known political office by Trump in 2017. Part of her job as director of this executive branch agency is to establish the “apparent successful candidate” in the general election and initiate transition procedures. Neither the Presidential Transition Act nor federal regulations offer specific language on how this determination is made — and therein lies Murphy’s small window of opportunity to be withholding. But the GSA as a whole has not explained the decision to refuse to recognize Biden, despite the fact that it is supposed to be an apolitical decision, simply facilitating the will of voters across the country. Murphy, too, has yet to comment publicly about her failure to acknowledge Biden’s win in the presidential election. Transition officials for Biden have called on the Trump administration appointee to end what they are calling an unwarranted obstruction, but Murphy still won’t budge, reports The New York Times.\xa0Although both the GSA and the White House have not said whether conversations on the matter have occurred between officials, it is clear that the decision is not being treated as non-partisan. At the time of her appointment, Murphy said: “I am not here to garner headlines or make a name for myself. My goal is to do my part in making the federal government more efficient, effective, and responsive to the American people.” (We think 2017 Murphy needs to have a talk with 2020 Murphy because the people have spoken and she is actively ignoring them and derailing the democratic process.) It should also be noted that Murphy’s actions are completely unprecedented: Past GSA administrators have typically issued a letter of ascertainment within hours of the election being called so that the incoming administration can get to work setting up a new government. Even with legal challenges and recounts, every other presidential race for the past 60 years has formally determined the winner within 24 hours. It’s already been almost two weeks.Murphy’s political associations — and the apparent galvanization of the Republican party at the hands of the outgoing president — have been noted as playing a role in this. As a lawyer, Murphy has spent the last 20 years specializing in government procurement, holding positions as a Republican congressional staffer and working her way up in the GSA and Small Business Administration, reports The Los Angeles Times. She briefly worked in the private sector while volunteering for Trump’s own transition team in 2016 before her appointment to director in 2017, and is now known as being in Trump’s pocket.Whether or not Trump decides to concede, Murphy’s responsibility is to the American people — as she said in her own words — and not to the person that appointed her and is trying to derail democracy as we know it. Full stop. Like what you see?

And it comes after UK officials reported a small number of adverse reactions in people who received the jab on their first day of its rollout. Two cases of anaphylaxis and one possible allergic reaction were recorded, prompting a revision of guidelines. Put simply, Anaphylaxis is a condition can cause throat swelling, breathing difficulty and problems swallowing. The UK’s National Health Service even describes it as severe and sometimes life-threatening. Late on Wednesday, the UK regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not get the vaccine. An expert from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine advised Reuters that anyone who’s ever needed to use an EpiPen should delay having this vaccine, at least until a reason for the adverse reaction has been clarified. Severe allergies are very rare, however. That\'s according to London\'s Queen Mary University, which also told us that in 2012 there were only seven hospital admissions per 100,000 people for severe allergies, they said. Some experts Reuters spoke with praised UK regulators\' caution, while others -- such as a representative of the Mayo Clinic in the US -- said these added restrictions in Britain were"overdoing it".

{'_id': '1f9ac1c074a77d144814ee088f713070', 'title': 'Which Covid Vaccine Should You Get? Experts Cite the Effect Against Severe Disease', 'description': 'At first glance, the results reported Friday from the long-awaited trial of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine might have seemed disappointing. Its overall efficacy — the ability to prevent moderate and severe disease — was reported at 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin American countries and 57% in South Africa. Those figures appear far below the high bar set by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the first two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States, which reported overall efficacy from 94% to 95%. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and now the lead medical adviser to President Joe Biden on the coronavirus pandemic, acknowledged the striking difference at a briefing Friday. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “If you woke up and you say, ‘Well, go to the door on the left and you get 94 or 95%, go to the door on the right and you get 72%,’ which door do you want to go to?” he asked. But Fauci said that the more crucial measure was the ability to prevent severe disease, which translates to keeping people out of the hospital and preventing deaths. And that result, for Johnson & Johnson, was 85% in all of the countries where it was tested, including South Africa, where a rapidly spreading variant of the virus had shown some ability to elude vaccines. More important than preventing “some aches and a sore throat,” Fauci said, is to fend off severe disease, especially in people with underlying conditions and in older adults, who are more likely to become seriously ill and to die from COVID-19. “If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress in human suffering and death in this epidemic that we’re seeing, particularly now,” Fauci said, “as we well know, over the last several weeks, our health care system has been stressed by the number of people that require hospitalization, as well as intensive care.” Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, compared the ability to prevent severe disease to the effects of flu shots, which do not always prevent influenza entirely but can make it less severe. “The same thing seems to be applying here, in a circumstance where this variant is clearly making it a little tougher to get the most vigorous response that you would want to have,” Collins said. “But still, for severe disease, it’s looking really good.” The Moderna vaccine also showed high efficacy, 100%, against severe disease. The Pfizer-BioNTech one appeared to as well, but the overall number of severe cases in the study was too small to be sure. But researchers warn that trying to compare effectiveness between new studies and earlier ones may be misleading, because the virus is evolving quickly and to some extent the trials have studied different pathogens. “You have to recognize that Pfizer and Moderna had an advantage,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said. “They did their clinical trials before the variant strains became very apparent. Johnson & Johnson was testing its vaccine not only against the standard strain but they had the variants.” The best way to stop the spread of mutants and to prevent more new ones from emerging is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, Fauci and other researchers say. Viruses cannot mutate unless they are replicating, and they cannot replicate unless they can get into cells. Keeping them out by immunizing people can shut down the process. In addition to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines already in use in the United States, three more may soon become available: those made by Novavax, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has already been authorized in Britain and other countries. Globally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is expected to play an important role, especially in low and middle-income countries, because it works after just one shot, is relatively inexpensive, and is easier to store and distribute than the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna because it does not share their stringent requirements for freezing and refrigerating. People waiting to be vaccinated may wonder if they will be able to pick and choose among vaccines, and if they should hold out and wait until the one that looks best to them becomes available. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN that if there was an abundant supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, they would be his first choices because of their higher overall efficacy. But for now, there is not enough of those vaccines. If he could not get either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the Moderna one, he would take the Johnson & Johnson shot, Offit said — as long as the data that the company will be presenting to the Food and Drug Administration looks as good as what the company reported Friday. He said Johnson & Johnson’s report of the reduction in severe disease was a powerful selling point. “That’s what you want,” Offit said. “You want to stay out of the hospital and stay out of the morgue.” He noted that the company was also studying a two-shot regimen, which might raise its efficacy. People who take the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should be able to safely receive a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine later if a booster shot is needed, he said. Schaffner said he had just attended a meeting with other public health experts, and they had asked one another what they would tell their spouses or partners to do if they could get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine tomorrow or had to wait three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech’s or Moderna’s. “All of us said, ‘Get the one tomorrow,’” Schaffner said. “The virus is bad. You’re risking three more weeks of exposure as opposed to getting protection tomorrow.” He said Johnson & Johnson’s 85% efficacy against severe disease was a bit lower than those reported by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, “but it’s still pretty darn high.” It is not yet known whether it would be safe to take one type of vaccine now and then another later, Schaffner said, adding, “We haven’t studied this.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The drug binds to an enzyme called a protease to keep the virus from replicating. Protease-inhibiting medicines have been successful in treating other types of viruses, include HIV and Hepatitis C.The new protease inhibitor is the second such medicine Pfizer has brought into human trials to treat Covid-19. Pfizer is testing another given intravenously to hospitalized virus patients.NYC Municipal Workers Will Return May 3 (10:30 a.m. NY)New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said about 80,000 city workers will return to their offices beginning May 3, a promise he outlined in his State of the City address in January.“We’re going to have strict safety measures in place,” de Blasio said Tuesday during a virus briefing. “It’s another step toward the full recovery of New York City.”The city has administered more than 3.4 million vaccines and is expecting a “major boost” in supply in early April, the mayor said.

We do not know how the epidemic is developing and where there are pockets that remain.”In a separate presentation, Fauci sounded a more positive tone. He said people should remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook, even as U.S. cases plateau following recent declines.“I don’t think that that should cause us to despair,” Fauci said in an online talk while being welcomed as an honorary fellow by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. “As we continue to vaccinate more and more people, which will ultimately give us control of the outbreak, we’ve got to remember we can’t just completely turn off all public health measures.”Countries Loosen Visitor Rules (8:20 a.m. NY)Cyprus will open its borders starting April 1 to visitors from Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K., the country’s tourism ministry said. Those with a negative test result who haven’t come into close contact with a confirmed case will be guaranteed a quarantine-free stay.

The medicine, a cheap product used for decades to treat allergies and skin conditions, has saved an estimated 22,000 lives in the U.K. alone, the NHS said in a paper looking at how the health service responded to the pandemic.U.K. Unemployment Up Less Than Expected (3:20 p.m. HK)U.K. unemployment rose less than expected during a national lockdown to control the coronavirus as a government furlough program preserved jobs. The number of people looking for work rose 11,000 to 1.7 million, taking the jobless rate to 5%, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists expected the rate to rise to 5.2%.Regeneron Cocktail Cuts Hospitalizations 70% (2:53 p.m. HK)Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it would apply for U.S. authorization for a lower dose of its Covid-19 antibody cocktail, after data from a final-stage trial showed early use of the drug reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 70%.Malaysia, Singapore Vaccine Certification (2:46 p.m. HK)Malaysia and Singapore are working toward reciprocal vaccination certification as the Southeast Asian neighbors plan to restore cross-border travel. Operational details, including the application process involved for entry and exit between the two nations will be discussed further.Covid Patients Should Postpone Surgery: Study (2:15 p.m. HK)Surgery should be delayed seven weeks for people who test positive for Covid-19 to reduce the risk of dying, according to the COVIDSurg Collaborative, an international group of 15,000 surgeons reviewing the likelihood of complications from elective surgery in coronavirus cases. Using data from 140,727 patients in 1,674 hospitals across 116 countries, the group found patients are more than 2.5 times more likely to die after surgery if the operation was performed within six weeks of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.Germany’s Easter Lockdown (9:55 a.m. HK)Chancellor Merkel and regional leaders agreed to put Germany into hard lockdown over Easter to try to reverse a “third wave” of infections fueled by faster-spreading mutations.Under the plan, stores will be shuttered from April 1 for five days, except for food stores which will open on April 3, Merkel said after a video call with the country’s 16 state premiers that lasted more than 11 hours. Citizens will be encouraged to remain at home, and private gatherings limited to one other household and a maximum of five people.“We are now in a very, very serious situation,” Merkel said at a news conference that started just after 2:30 a.m. in Berlin. “The case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive-care beds are filling up again,” she said, adding that the number of infections must come down to allow the country’s vaccination campaign to start taking effect.Separately, Merkel said the EU shouldn’t impose a general vaccine export ban. “We must be very careful with general export bans at this stage,” she said. “Instead we will have to look very closely at supply chains.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Three months later the country has lost almost 100,000 more lives Coronavirus patients in a field hospital set up inside a sports coliseum in Santo André, on the outskirt of São Paulo, Brazil, on 4 March. Photograph: André Penner/AP It was midway through February when André Machado realized Brazil’s coronavirus catastrophe was racing into a bewildering and remorseless new phase. “The floodgates opened and the water came gushing out,” recalled the infectious disease specialist from the Our Lady of the Conception hospital in Porto Alegre, one of the largest cities in southern Brazil. Since then, Machado’s hospital, like health centres up and down the country, has been engulfed by a deluge of jittery, gasping patients – many of them previously healthy and bafflingly young. Among the recent admissions was a heavily pregnant 37-year-old who was brought in complaining of breathing difficulties and a cough. Doctors performed an emergency C-section to deliver the baby in a desperate bid to take the pressure off the expectant mother’s Covid-racked lungs. “We’re trying to help people but this disease is much faster and more aggressive than the tactics we’ve been using,” Machado, 44, said of his team’s efforts to keep pace with a tripling of admissions. “It’s like we’re flogging a dead horse,” he said, before adding: “This disease is going to kill many more people in Brazil.” At the end of last year Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro – a Donald Trump-worshiping populist who has gleefully sabotaged Covid containment efforts – declared his country had reached “the tail end” of what was already one of the world’s worst outbreaks. Bolsonaro was wrong. Three months later Latin America’s largest nation has lost almost 100,000 more lives – taking its total death toll to more than 275,000, second only to the US – and been plunged into the deadliest chapter of its 13-month epidemic. Jair Bolsonaro speaks to the media in Brasília, Brazil, on 10 March. Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters This week, as a record 2,349 daily deaths were reported, the former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva castigated Bolsonaro’s “moronic” handling of the crisis and urged citizens to confront their incompetent “blowhard” leader. “This country is in a state of utter tumult and confusion because there’s no government. I’ll repeat that: this country has no government,” Lula declared, blaming Bolsonaro’s “uncivilised” leadership and rejection of science for the scale of Brazil’s disaster. “So, so many lives could have been saved,” Lula claimed, warning: “Covid is taking over the country.” As the emergency intensified this week, frontline health workers from Porto Alegre to Recife, a coastal city 3,000km further north, described scenes of heartbreak, despair and exhaustion as intensive care units and cemeteries fill up like never before.

Photograph: Raphael Alves/EPA “It feels like we’re putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” said Eduarda Santa Rosa Barata, a 31-year-old infectologist who works in three ICUs in the north-eastern capital of Pernambuco state, all now stretched to the limit. “We’re engaged in damage reduction … You open new beds and they fill up immediately.” A few days earlier, Barata had admitted a 37-year-old man who had no underlying medical conditions but whose lungs were so badly damaged he needed intubation. “It seems so random,” she said. “It’s a bizarre disease. It’s frightening.” Machado saw several explanations for the torrent of cases he and other doctors are now seeing, including political mismanagement and the slackening of social distancing measures, principally among the young. In recent months such containment efforts have largely collapsed, with schools and businesses reopening and Bolsonaro’s tourism minister even urging citizens to start holidaying again. But the doctor suspected a third, more troubling element was also at work: an enigmatic and apparently more contagious variant called P1 that is thought to have emerged in the Amazon region in late 2020 but is now circulating across Brazil, including in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, where Machado works. People walk in a shopping center in São Paulo, Brazil, on 4 March. Photograph: Cris Faga/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock “This isn’t just theoretical. It’s something we’re seeing in practice,” Machado said of the variant, at least 10 cases of which have been detected in the UK and 15 in the US. “Before the end of 2020, you’d get a family and one member would be infected but not the other three or four members, even though they lived in the same environment. You don’t see this any more. If there’s one confirmed case, everyone ends up getting infected by the virus,” he said. “It’s obvious that this new variant is now circulating among us.” Just how much of Brazil’s current crisis is down to the new variant, or other variants traced to the UK and South Africa, is a matter of intense debate. Some experts believe the variant has provided a convenient smokescreen for political leaders who have failed to rein in a disease President Bolsonaro has dismissed as a “little flu”. As he ordered a two-week emergency shutdown in Brazil’s most populous state on Thursday, the São Paulo governor, João Doria, claimed the variant played a key role in pushing hospitals to the brink. “This new strain of the virus is very aggressive and very dangerous,” Doria warned, claiming Brazil was “collapsing” under the weight of the surge in cases. Jesem Orellana, an epidemiologist from the Amazon city of Manaus, where hospitals recently ran out of oxygen as a result of the explosion of infections, was unconvinced mutations were the main culprit. “From a political point of view, it’s much easier to place the blame on the variant. But we all know that the worst variant of all is the way the epidemic has been mishandled,” he said. Orellana suspected that having failed to halt coronavirus with unpopular and economically painful lockdowns, politicians at all levels of government were now “using the variant as a crutch to prop themselves up and to justify their mistakes and their negligence over the epidemic”.

Photograph: Diego Vara/Reuters But Marcos Boulos, a leading infectious disease specialist, said he had no doubt the P1 variant was contributing to Brazil’s soaring caseload: “There’s no way of hiding this.” Boulos also said anecdotal evidence from hospitals around Brazil suggested the variant was also producing more serious cases in young people. “We don’t yet have the data to categorically affirm this but it’s possible, from what doctors are seeing,” said the University of São Paulo professor. “Here in the hospital we’ve got a 20-year-old woman in our ICU in serious condition. Today you have serious patients in ICU from all age groups. Before we’d say it was almost 90% elderly. Today they’re still the majority, but not in same way,” Boulos added. “We don’t yet know how this works, but it’s what we are seeing … There’s no other reason why young people would suddenly start suffering from a more serious disease.” São Paulo’s health secretary, Jean Gorinchteyn, this week told reporters that in many of that state’s ICUs half of patients were now under 50. “I’m talking about 26 and 29 and 30-year-olds – often in a very grave condition,” he said, urging citizens to avoid crowds and remain at home. “We all need to understand that what is happening right now is a different pandemic from the one we saw last year,” Gorinchteyn claimed. Barata said she also had the impression that her Covid patients were getting younger, and reaching hospital in a worse condition. Despite having been immunised with the Chinese-produced CoronaVac vaccine in February, she admitted feeling more fearful now than during the previous peak last June. “It feels like every day the virus draws nearer … Everywhere you look around you, you can say there’s someone who has symptoms, or who is sick, or in hospital … The mother-in-law of one of my colleagues is in critical condition in intensive care,” she said. Barata said she was uncertain what, if any, role new variants were playing in Brazil’s latest misfortune, but whatever – or whoever – was responsible, she feared the human tragedy was far from over: “It feels like the disease is laying siege to us, closing in and infecting everyone who hasn’t yet caught it.” Machado said that after the delivery of her 36-week-old baby, the expectant mother and her child were rushed to intensive care, where the former was put on a ventilator. “We don’t know if she’ll make it,” he admitted last week as the hospital’s Covid-19 wards reached the brink of collapse and fears grew over the global impact of Brazil’s unchecked epidemic. Twenty-four hours later, at 10 minutes past midnight, the woman was gone, leaving five orphaned children and a country in disarray.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Abbott announced on March 2 that he would end the state’s mask mandate on March 10, though experts have warned that loosening restrictions too quickly could lead to surges. However, Abbott said the state’s declining coronavirus cases and accelerating vaccine distribution would enable the state to safely reopen. On Sunday, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported 2,347 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and 69 additional deaths. Hospitalizations continued to fall as well, to 4,093, according to the department. The state has the third-highest death count in the U.S., according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as more than 46,300 Texans have died from the virus. Nearly ten percent of the state’s population — 2.8 million people — have now been fully vaccinated against the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, in Mississippi, which lifted its mask mandate on March 3, there has been an average of 457 cases per day in the past week, a decrease of 23 percent from the average two weeks earlier, according to the New York Times. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves announced that he would lift restrictions shortly after Abbott said he would loosen restrictions in Texas. “Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules. Our hospitalizations and case numbers have plummeted, and the vaccine is being rapidly distributed. It is time!” Reeves tweeted. Days before the governors lifted restrictions, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky had warned against relaxing mitigation efforts, saying, “Things are tenuous. Now is not the time to relax restrictions.” President Biden labeled the push toward reopening “neanderthal thinking” and urged governors to keep restrictions in place.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The results will heap pressure on Mrs Merkel ahead of September’s general election, when Germans will finally choose her successor as chancellor. According to initial projections, her Christian Democrat (CDU) party slumped to its worst ever results in two states it once regarded as strongholds. In the key southern state of Baden-Württemberg, where the party ruled uninterrupted for 58 years, it limped in with just 23 per cent of the vote, far behind the rival Greens who won the state with 31 per cent. In Rhineland-Palatinate, it saw its vote share fall by more than 6 points to just 26 per cent, as the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) won the state with 34.5 per cent. Experts cautioned that the unusually high share of postal votes because of the coronavirus meant initial projections might not be as accurate as usual. But it was clear the CDU had suffered a terrible evening, as its two main rivals in September divided the spoils. Lars Klingbeil, the SPD secretary-general told German television the results had blown the race to succeed Mrs Merkel as chancellor in September wide open, . “There are majorities in reach for coalitions without the CDU,” Mr Klingbeil said. “The message to the federal government is: the race is open.” These were the first significant elections in Germany since the pandemic began, and the CDU’s heavy losses were widely seen as a verdict on the country's shambolic vaccine roll-out. Just a couple of months ago, the CDU was ahead in Rhineland-Palatinate and neck-and-neck with the Greens in Baden-Württemberg, but it saw its vote evaporate in both states as it became clear that Germany, the world’s fourth-biggest economy, is months behind the UK and US in vaccinating its citizens. A corruption scandal that saw three MPs forced to resign in a week — two of them over alleged kickbacks for government facemask contracts — in the run-up to voting did not help. Mrs Merkel, who was praised for much of last year for her initial handling of the crisis, is now reaping the voters' anger over her fateful decision to entrust vaccine orders to the European Commission. Just 6 per cent of Germans have received their first jab so far, compared to more than 30 per cent of Britons. After almost four months in lockdown, Germany is weary of restrictions and there is no end in sight. The CDU is now close to crisis. There must be serious doubt over whether Armin Laschet, who was elected party leader less than two months ago, can now be trusted to be its candidate for chancellor in September. Jens Spahn, until recently another contender for the role, is facing calls to resign as health minister. That leaves Markus Söder, the popular leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, who may now be parachuted in as a rescue candidate. The far-Right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), for so long the thorn in Mrs Merkel’s side, failed to capitalise on public anger and saw its vote share fall in both states. But the CDU’s two main rivals, the Greens and the SPD, will both now believe they have a chance to oust the party from power in September and lead a rival coalition. The SPD, currently Mrs Merkel’s junior coalition partner, have managed to distance themselves from the vaccine chaos and their chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz, has had a good pandemic as finance minister. The Greens, currently second in the national polls, will believe their resounding victory in Baden-Württemberg could be the springboard for the party to seize the chancellery and lead a national government for the first time. Mrs Merkel, who has spent so much of her final two years in fighting to secure the CDU leadership for her ideological heirs, could now find the next chancellor isn't even from her party.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'a2762281572c25a1154cd444a770621b', 'title': "Is 'Natural Immunity' From COVID Better Than a Vaccine?", 'description': 'On the heels of last month\'s news of stunning results from Pfizer\'s and Moderna\'s experimental COVID-19 vaccines, Sen. Rand Paul tweeted a provocative comparison.The new vaccines were 90% and 94.5% effective, Paul said. But "naturally acquired" COVID-19 was even better, at 99.9982%, he claimed.Paul, R-Ky., is one of many people who, weary of lockdowns and economic losses, have extolled the benefits of contracting the coronavirus. The senator was diagnosed with the disease this year and has argued that surviving a bout of COVID-19 confers greater protection, and poses fewer risks, than getting vaccinated.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe trouble with that logic is that it\'s difficult to predict who will survive an infection unscathed, said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto. Given all of the unknowns -- like a region\'s hospital capacity, or the strength of a person\'s immune response -- choosing the disease over the vaccine is "a very bad decision," she said.The primary advantage of a vaccine is that it\'s predictable and safe, she said. "It\'s been optimally tailored to generate an effective immune response."But what do we know about how the immunity from a prior infection compares with the protection given by the new vaccines? And what if you have already had COVID -- is it safe to be vaccinated? We asked experts to weigh in on the latest evidence.Which produces a stronger immune response: a natural infection or a vaccine?The short answer: We don\'t know. But COVID-19 vaccines have predictably prevented illness, and they are a far safer bet, experts said.Vaccines for some pathogens, like pneumococcal bacteria, induce better immunity than the natural infection does. Early evidence suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines may fall into this category. Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies -- one marker of immune response -- in their blood than did people who had been sick with COVID-19.In other cases, however, a natural infection is more powerful than a vaccine. For example, having mumps -- which can cause sterility in men -- generates lifelong immunity, but some people who have received one or two doses of the vaccine still get the disease.To Paul\'s point: Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong. A vast majority of people infected produce at least some antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection. And the evidence so far suggests that this protection will persist for years, preventing serious illness, if not reinfection.But there is a "massive dynamic range" in that immune response, with a 200-fold difference in antibody levels.In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months. "Those people might benefit more from the vaccine than others would," said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.The diversity in the immune response from natural infection might be because of differences in the amount of virus to which the person was exposed.With a vaccine, everyone gets the same dose. "We know the dose that is being administered, and we know that that dose is effective at eliciting an immune response," Gommerman said. "So that becomes a variable that\'s taken off the table when you get the vaccine."I\'m young, healthy and at low risk of COVID. Why not take my chances with that rather than get a rushed vaccine?The experts were unanimous in their answer: COVID-19 is by far the more dangerous option."It\'s clear that one is less problematic for the body to recover from them than the other -- there\'s more risk with natural infection," said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.People who are obese, or who have diseases like diabetes are particularly susceptible to severe cases of COVID-19. On average, the virus seems to be less risky for younger people, and women tend to fare better than men. But beyond those broad generalizations, doctors don\'t know why some people get very sick and die while others have no symptoms.For example, people who harbor certain mutations in immune genes are more susceptible to the disease, several studies have shown. "So there\'s a risk factor that has nothing to do with age," Gommerman said.In a study of more than 3,000 people, ages 18 to 34, who were hospitalized for COVID, 20% required intensive care and 3% died."It\'s true that most people aren\'t going to be hospitalized, most people aren\'t going to get in the intensive care unit or die," said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, who represents the American Academy of Pediatrics at the meetings of the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.But "nobody is immune to severe disease," she said. And even if people are not at high risk of COVID themselves, their friends or family could be.As many as one in three people who recover from COVID have chronic complaints, including exhaustion and a racing heart, for months afterward. This includes people under 35 with no previous health conditions. Some survivors of COVID also show troubling signs that their body has turned on itself, with symptoms similar to those of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.COVID vaccines, in contrast, carry little known risk. They have been tested in tens of thousands of people with no serious side effects -- at least so far. "Once you start vaccinating millions, you might find very, very rare events," Hanage said. "But we have to know that they are very, very rare and much more rare than the adverse events associated with natural infection."I had COVID. Is it safe for me to get a vaccine? If so, when could I get one?It\'s safe, and probably even beneficial, for anyone who has had COVID to get the vaccine at some point, experts said."There\'s nothing deleterious about getting a boost to an immune response that you\'ve had before," Pepper said. "You could get an actually even better immune response by boosting whatever immunity you had from the first infection by a vaccine."In fact, at a meeting on Wednesday, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said up to 10% of participants in clinical trials for the vaccines had been infected with the virus without knowing it. Their immune responses to the vaccine are being analyzed, he said.If you\'ve already had COVID-19, you can afford to wait awhile for the vaccine.Studies from Pepper\'s team and others have shown that the immune response evolves over the first few months after infection, but everyone who has had COVID has some level of protection during that time."We didn\'t see anybody who didn\'t develop some sort of an immune response," she said. "I don\'t think those people need to rush out and go get the vaccine in the same way that people who are highly susceptible really do."The ACIP, which makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccine distribution, said at a meeting on Wednesday that people who had not been infected should get priority over those who contracted the virus in the past 90 days."At some point we\'ll need to figure out whether 90 days is the right number," Maldonado said. But for now, "people who have evidence of infection recently should probably not be vaccinated at first in line because there\'s so little vaccine available."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '3b0ac7da34a0956741a9605695225114', 'title': 'Pfizer and Moderna testing vaccines on UK coronavirus variant', 'description': 'Drugs giants Pfizer and Moderna are testing their new coronavirus vaccines to see if they work against the new mutated version sweeping across the UK. More than 40 nations have restricted travel from Britain after the Government at the weekend expressed warned that a new, easier to catch variant was running out of control. Some 500,000 high risk people have already been given their first shot of the double-dose Pfizer vaccine in the UK and both vaccines have also been authorised for use in America. "Based on the data to date, we expect that the Moderna vaccine-induced immunity would be protective against the variants recently described in the UK," Moderna said in a statement. "We will be performing additional tests in the coming weeks to confirm this expectation." Pfizer said it is now “generating data” on how well blood samples from people immunized with its vaccine “may be able to neutralize the new strain from the UK.” Ugur Sahin, chief executive of BioNTech which co-produced the Pfizer vaccine said the company was confident the vaccine will be effective against the UK mutation of the coronavirus. If not, he estimated a modified vaccine could be made in six weeks. He told the German Press Agency that although the vaccine had not been tested against the new, more infectious mutation, “scientifically, it is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine also can deal with the new virus variant.” “We have already tested the vaccine against around 20 other virus variants with other mutations. The immune response produced by our vaccine has always inactivated all forms of the virus. " Mr Sahin said that even if the current vaccine was found to be ineffective, the company had the infrastructure in place to provide a modified vaccine within six weeks. “In principle the beauty of the messenger technology is that we can directly start to engineer a vaccine which completely mimics this new mutation - we could be able to provide a new vaccine technically within six weeks." Mr Sahin said testing over the next two weeks would determine the vaccine’s effectiveness against the new UK strain of the virus. By Tuesday morning a total of 45 countries were off-limits to all UK travellers, including 23 of the EU\'s 27 member states. The severity of the bans varies, from from Spain\'s ban on non-Spanish visitors from Britain, to Croatia\'s suspension of all flights until January 31. Among overnight additions to the no entry list were Jamaica, Grenada and Dominican Republic. As nations attempted to keep track of any entry of the new variant, it was reported that the first patients in Italy thought to have the new strain were an Italian spy and her husband, a former British army officer. The unnamed woman, 42, works for AISE, the Italian equivalent of MI6. Her 45-year-old husband is understood to have flown into Rome\'s Fiumicino airport from the UK in the last few days. The former British Army officer, who was reportedly an aide-de-camp to a general, now works for a financial institution in Rome. Both at home, in isolation, and are said to have mild symptoms, but have need declared the country\'s "patients zero" for the strain. Italy wants to trace and test the estimated 44,000 people who flew in from the UK in December in a bid to discover if any of them are suffering from the mutant strain of Covid-19. The authorities want to locate all the travelers, swab them for the coronavirus, and then trace their family, friends and other contacts - a huge logistical challenge. Some Italian commentators and medical experts have been highly critical of the fact that it took the British authorities so long to publicly announce the discovery of the new strain of the virus. "It is a highly alarming situation caused by the delay in communication by the British authorities," said Corriere della Sera newspaper on Tuesday. Meanwhile Singapore is to ban all short-term visitors with a travel history to the UK or Australia’s New South Wales from midnight on Wednesday. Passengers from these locations will also be unable to transit through Singapore’s Changi international airport. Returning Singaporeans and permanent residents who have travel history to the UK in the last 14 days, will be required to undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival in Singapore, before starting their 14-day quarantine.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

For the past two days, they have passed their target of vaccinating over 150,000 people a day.

He\'s steered the nation through skyrocketing cases, misinformation, an ambivalent public, and a disjointed national response to COVID\'s containment—all while walking the tightrope of partisan politics.But that doesn\'t mean that Fauci doesn\'t have a few of his own regrets. Yes, he typically focuses on the concrete measures we can all take to stay safe, but every so often the immunologist treats us to a more reflective side.In a recent interview with PIX11 News, host Dan Mannarino asked Fauci to describe his "one regret about the handling of COVID-19," and the doctor was characteristically candid. Read on to learn Fauci\'s answer, plus three more regrets he\'s shared publicly. And for more Fauci news, check out Dr. Fauci Says This Is What\'s "Disturbing"About One New COVID Strain.Read the original article on Best Life. 1 He regrets a lack of coordinated response. Fauci knows that our nation\'s efforts to quell COVID have yielded both successes and failures. In a recent "lightning round" of questioning during his interview with PIX11 News, the host asked Fauci to name his top regret about the handling of COVID-19."That\'s tough…" Fauci replied. "I believe if we had a more coordinated approach, but I\'m not sure that\'s anybody\'s fault," he began. "We\'re living in a very divisive society… and when you\'re in a divisive society, then all of a sudden public health matters become politicized. When they become politicized, you\'ve got a problem."While Fauci was careful not to point fingers at any one political affiliation, he gave this example: "If someone doesn\'t want to wear a mask because they think it\'s a political statement, that\'s a problem." And for more insights from Fauci, check out Dr. Fauci Just Said These 5 Very Scary Words About COVID-19. 2 He also felt he "should\'ve been more vocal" about testing. Though Fauci had endorsed mass testing early in his COVID response, he acknowledged that he could have tried harder to ensure his message was heard. "Deep down, perhaps I should\'ve been much more vocal about saying, we really absolutely gotta do that," Fauci said in a November interview with STAT\'s senior infectious diseases reporter, Helen Branswell. "I said it, it went nowhere, and maybe I should have kept pushing the envelope on that.""Community spread doesn\'t stop spontaneously unless you do something about it," Fauci added. "It is easier to stop when the level is relatively low. The only way that you can get at community spread is that you need to test people who are without symptoms," he explained. 3 He regretted casting doubt on the U.K.\'s quick approval of vaccines. When the U.K. was the first to approve Pfizer\'s COVID vaccine, Fauci suggested to the public that they had done so in haste. "The FDA in the United States, I think, everyone realizes globally is the gold standard of regulatory function," he said at the time.Fauci later acknowledged that he misspoke, saying, "There really has been a misunderstanding and for that I\'m sorry… I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community at the U.K.," he told the BBC.He continued his mea culpa by acknowledging his insult. "Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that\'s just the reality," he added. "I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way." And for more vaccine news, check out The FDA Just Ruled You Can\'t Do These 4 Things With the COVID Vaccines. 4 He acknowledged that early messaging about masks was flawed. Perhaps more a reflection than a regret, Fauci has offered some thoughts on his flawed early messaging on masks.According to a timeline published by Forbes, when the virus first reached the U.S. in Mar. 2020, Fauci told the public, "there\'s no reason to be walking around with a mask." He suggested that masks should be reserved for frontline healthcare workers and could cause "unintended consequences" if people touched their faces while adjusting them. By the end of that month, Fauci announced that he was engaged in "very active discussion" about whether to reverse that guidance. Not long after, in an Apr. 3, 2020 interview, he urged viewers to "wear some sort of facial covering" when out in public.Later, in a Jul. 2020 interview with The Washington Post, he explained the reversal. "What happened as the weeks and months came by, two things became clear: one, that there wasn\'t a shortage of masks, we had plenty of masks and coverings that you could put on that\'s plain cloth…so that took care of that problem. Secondly, we fully realized that there are a lot of people who are asymptomatic who are spreading infection. So it became clear that we absolutely should be wearing masks consistently," he said.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The Israeli study measured the efficacy of the first shot within 15 to 28 days of its administration — not a significant delay. And most participants in the trial did receive their second shots, the authors told the WSJ. The big picture: Most of the people in this study got their second doses, and got those doses on time. Second doses were not delayed in this case, and so this study does not directly answer the question of what happens when you delay second doses.The findings will bolster calls to delay second doses because they indicate that first doses are more effective than we realized — making a compelling case to get that level of protection to as many people as possible as quickly as possible, to save lives and bring the pandemic under control.Like this article?

But their effectiveness, manufacturing and distribution vary.Why it matters: Any of the authorized vaccines are much better than no vaccine, especially for people at high risk of severe coronavirus infections. But their differences may fuel perceptions of inequity, and raise legitimate questions about the best way to use each one. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for freeThe big picture: Under the threat of new variants, vaccinating as many people as fast as possible is key to controlling the outbreak in the U.S. Public health experts are generally united in saying that Americans should get whichever vaccine they are offered first.All three vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. — from Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson — registered a very high efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19.“The efficacy against severe disease [is] greater than 85%, and there have been no hospitalization or deaths in multiple countries, even in countries that have the variants,” NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said of the Johnson & Johnson shot this weekend on ABC’s “This Week.” “Be careful when you try to parse this percent versus that.”It is difficult to compare the vaccines head-to-head based on existing clinical trial data, but there are key differences.The most obvious is the dosing. J&J requires only one shot, although a second booster dose is being tested. Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines require two doses, a few weeks apart. Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines have, so far, been more effective than the J&J vaccine in clinical trials at preventing any symptomatic disease. Some experts quickly point out that the vaccines weren’t compared directly against one another, so the differences may be on paper only.But on paper, those differences appear significant: The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offer protection of more than 90%, while J&J’s efficacy against symptomatic disease is 66%. On the other hand, some people may prefer J&J’s one-and-done approach. It appears to offer protection against a variant that originated in South Africa. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear to be less effective against this variant, though it is unclear how much less effective and the companies are studying it.J&J is also cheaper and easier to ship than the other two shots.Yes, but: Whether the vaccines are equally as good or not, the efficacy numbers are already fueling the perception of a two-tiered vaccine system, the Washington Post reports.“J&J is going to be a challenge for all of us,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told WaPo in an interview.And if the J&J vaccine is heavily used in communities of color, which have already borne the brunt of the pandemic, trust could be further eroded.“If we end up with a hierarchy that says all rich White people get Pfizer, and all poor Black people get J&J, that would be a problem,” Helene Gayle, president and chief executive of the Chicago Community Trust, told the Post.What they’re saying: “The whole thing is awkward. Everyone is treading on eggshells, because we want to get the right message across,” said John Moore, a Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Cornell University. “The nuances are very hard because we don’t have concrete answers to every question.”In an ideal world, it may make sense to give the J&J vaccine to younger people, he said, because that would potentially lower the risk of resistant variants emerging. “The problem is, we don’t really have the luxury of time or of doing all the clinical trials you’d like to see done.”What we’re watching: "Trying to convince people that the vaccines are all equal isn’t going to work. People are making claims that go beyond the solid data we have, and that’s a risky proposition. We’re going to see the differences in rates of adverse events, for example, pretty quickly for ourselves once we know lots of people getting vaccinated," clinical-trial expert Hilda Bastian told Vox."Especially when the fear of major outbreaks subsides — prematurely — and we’re trying to get younger people to accept vaccination, adverse reactions are going to matter to people."The bottom line: “The worst option is no vaccine. And in the end, any of these approved vaccines is better than no vaccine, and that’s absolutely solid,” Moore said.Like this article?

To boost revenue, he proposed raising the stamp duty on trading to 0.13% from 0.1%, sparking a selloff in equities.Chan said the focus of the budget is on stabilizing an economy hit by political and social unrest in 2019 and then the coronavirus pandemic last year. After a record contraction of 6.1% last year, the economy will grow in a range of 3.5%-5.5% in 2021, he said.At the same time, Chan is seeking to rein in the budget deficit by raising revenue. The deficit is expected to narrow from a record of about HK$260 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31 to HK$101.6 billion in the coming year -- or 3.6% of gross domestic product.That compares with a deficit target of 2.2% for financial rival Singapore and a global average of 8.5% in 2021, according to International Monetary Fund projections.The consumption vouchers should help stimulate spending, benefiting restaurants, retailers and tourism businesses knocked by virus shutdowns last year. Retail sales in the city have plummeted and unemployment surged to the highest in more than 16 years.However, spending coupons can be “inefficient and an ineffective tool during Covid,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank NV. Administration costs would be higher compared with cash handouts, she said.The government announced almost HK$320 billion in virus stimulus last year to support industries and the economy, centered on a HK$10,000 cash handout to residents and a wage subsidy program to stem job losses.What Bloomberg Economics Says...Long-term scarring in Hong Kong’s economy is a major risk without effective support for hard-hit sectors -- a situation the government intends to address in its budget for next fiscal year.High-frequency data show the economy is starting to look up at last.

Due to their vulnerability, nursing home residents and health care workers have been among the first people to receive the vaccine, and "these findings show we have a lot of work to do to increase confidence and also really understand the barriers to vaccination amongst the population," Dr. Radhika Gharpure, lead author of the CDC report, told USA Today. The report looked at vaccination rates at more than 11,000 long-term care facilities in the U.S. between Dec. 18 and Jan. 17. While the vaccination numbers were low for staffers, 78 percent of residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Under a deal reached with CVS and Walgreens during the Trump administration, the pharmacies are sending technicians to participating nursing homes three times in order to vaccinate as many people as possible. Earlier polling data showed that some nursing home employees said they were concerned about side effects, while others did not want to be among the first group to get vaccinated. Several facilities have been working to educate workers about the vaccine. At Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, nearly two-thirds of employees said late last year they did not want to get the vaccine, but infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner told USA Today there was a push to share facts with staffers, and that "moved the needle."

They have sought to overrule local officials on disputes involving everything from pandemic restrictions and plastic bag bans to protections for immigrants. But this week, the collapse of the state’s power grid gave Democrats a chance to turn the tables. With the state reeling from a rare winter storm that caused widespread power outages, Democrats have mobilized public anger over the Republicans’ oversight of the energy industry, opening a new front in their battle to erode the party’s dominance of every statewide office and both chambers of the Legislature. While Democrats have made important inroads in recent election cycles, Texas Republicans have staved off the kind of game-changing gains that flipped states like Arizona and Georgia. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “Those in the Legislature and those in the executive branch of government have been spending too much time trying to run cities and counties and not enough tending to state issues,” said Sylvester Turner, the Democratic mayor of Houston, the largest city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the country. “And now it’s coming back to bite them. Before you can try to run my house, you’ve got to make sure you’re running your own.” Such appraisals come at a time when Greg Abbott, the Republican governor, was already under fire for his handling of the pandemic. Even before thawing freezers forced health officials in Houston to scramble this week to administer thousands of vaccine doses, Latino leaders in hard-hit South Texas were pleading with Abbott to allow city officials along the border to put into place stricter mitigation measures. At the same time, a steady drip of other scandals has focused scrutiny on the Republicans wielding power at the state level in Texas. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, remains under a cloud of legal trouble as he responds to abuse of power claims including a lawsuit by former aides who say he took bribes from a real estate developer. The Republican-dominated Texas Legislature is also no stranger to intrigue. In one episode, a secret audio recording in 2019 by a conservative activist showed Dennis Bonnen, the former speaker of the Texas House, plotting against fellow Republicans by seeking to enlist the support of hard-line activists to take them down in primary challenges. As attention shifts to the electricity crisis, Turner, the Houston mayor, figures among Democrats who have been sounding the alarm for years that the state’s power grid was at risk of failing. After a 2011 debacle in which a rare winter storm knocked out power around the state, Turner, then a state representative, warned the following year that state regulators were giving utilities too much leeway. Other Democrats around the state are now issuing calls for sweeping changes in the state oversight of the industry. “A lot of areas of Texas probably already felt like it was in an emergency before the blackout — COVID case numbers, peak hospital numbers and the vaccine scramble,” said Ana Sandoval, a Democrat and member of the San Antonio City Council. “State leaders need to take the blindfold off and realize energy is not just about economics. It’s a life-and-death issue.” Some Republicans are joining in the calls for greater accountability. Abbott declared reform of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state’s grid, an emergency item for the Legislature. State Rep. Dade Phelan, the Republican speaker of the Texas House, called for hearings to examine the factors contributing to the grid’s collapse. “People are suffering right now because we have failed,” said state Rep. Tony Tinderholt, a retired military officer regarded as one of the most conservative members in the House. Like millions of other Texans, Tinderholt, his wife and two young children were left without power in their home in Arlington, and took refuge in a hotel. “And when I say ‘we’, I’m talking about the Legislature, ERCOT and the power companies,” Tinderholt said. Much of the rest of the United States features electricity systems that are interconnected, but Texas has long stood out for having its own grid. While the system has been praised by hard-line conservatives as an example of the state’s go-it-alone mettle, the unusual setup originated when the Democrats who once wielded control over Texas politics sought to shield companies in the state from federal regulators overseeing interstate electricity sales. The Republicans who rose to power in Texas in the 1990s had their own ideas about turbocharging the electricity industry. Around that time, Texas energy giants like Enron (before its spectacular collapse in a 2001 accounting scandal) were winning plaudits for aggressive moves into power markets around the United States and the world. George W. Bush, while governor of Texas before becoming president, overhauled the Texas electricity market in 1999 with a bid to introduce greater competition in parts of the industry. But energy experts say that state regulators appointed by the Republican governors in power for decades in Texas have been loath to do anything that might raise electricity prices. “They wound up basically creating an old-style Soviet bureau,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston, referring to ERCOT. “This is a controlled flight into terrain.” Republicans have overseen the Texas energy industry for decades, but Abbott, along with other prominent Texas conservatives, has sought to deflect responsibility by assigning blame for the storm crisis on renewable energy sources like wind and solar that were hobbled by the cold snap. In an appearance on Fox News, Abbott asserted that the reliance on wind and solar “thrust Texas into a situation where it was lacking power in a statewide basis.” Still, such a claim runs counter to Abbott’s own role and that of his Republican predecessors, like Rick Perry and Bush, in overseeing the growth of renewable energy sources in Texas. Earlier in the week, Abbott himself attributed the power failure in part to freezing in natural gas transmission systems. Wind generation in Texas, which still accounts for a relatively small fraction of electricity production in the state, actually exceeded projections in recent days. ERCOT officials say limited supplies of natural gas, along with frozen instruments at the natural gas, coal and nuclear facilities that dwarf renewables in supplying Texas’ electricity, are the main factors in the crisis. Still, prominent Republicans like Perry, the former Texas governor and energy secretary in the Trump administration, have blamed renewables. In a blog post on the page of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, Perry sought to warn Democrats against trying to introduce greater oversight of the electricity industry. “Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business,” Perry said. Beyond arguing over energy sources, Abbott, who succeeded Perry in 2014, was already on the defensive over complaints by Democrats and even some Republicans over the insular way in which he names people to state boards and commissions. Legislation aiming to put an end to the governor’s so-called pay-for-play nominations for donors has failed to advance in the Republican-controlled chambers. Abbott appointed all three of the commissioners on the Public Utility Commission of Texas that oversees ERCOT. As for ERCOT itself, the leader of its board does not live in Texas but in Michigan; its vice-chair is a professor who lives in California and teaches at a university in Germany. “No one should be pretending that the cause of this catastrophe is some mysterious entity that is somehow detached from state government,” said Rep. Chris Turner, leader of the 67 Democrats in the Texas House. “This entire episode represents a catastrophic failure of leadership.” Still, even some Republicans who have demanded answers about the electricity crisis view things differently. Kel Seliger, a former mayor of Amarillo and now a member of the Texas Senate, cautioned about making drastic changes. “I don’t think they planned for something that has the look of a catastrophe for a lot of people,” Seliger said. “How much generation would it take and how much would it cost the taxpayers to ensure that this didn’t happen? Then you have to weigh the costs against how often do we have this kind of thing.” But with the power outages dragging on for several days in parts of the state, Democratic leaders are openly voicing exasperation. “I don’t know what this means either,” Eric Johnson, the mayor of Dallas, said on Twitter in response to a statement by ERCOT using jargon like “load shed” — a term referring to the deliberate shutdown of part of a power system to avoid a broader failure — to explain the outages. “People are suffering, and they need some idea of what to expect.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Dominion Voting Systems has sued Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell for defamation, seeking $1.3 billion in damages, and has threatened to sue Fox News and other conservative media outlets. Rival voting technology firm Smartmatic sued Fox News for $2.7 billion. CNN\'s Brian Stelter asked Dominion spokesman Michael Steel about the lawsuits on Sunday, including if any new ones are imminent. "I\'m not here to make news on that front, but let me say this: Mike Lindell is begging to be sued, and at some point, we may well oblige him," Steel said. Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, paid for three hours of airtime Friday on One America News Network to broadcast a show he produced about his voting conspiracy theories. OANN kicked it off with an extraordinary disclaimer. Lindell tweeted Saturday night that he might sue Dominion, a threat Steel laughed off on CNN. Steel, a former spokesman for House Speakers Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and John Boehner (R-Ohio), also said Dominion suing Fox News is "definitely a possibility." A media law professor, Lynn Oberlander, told Stelter that the disclaimers Fox News, Newsmax, OANN, and other outlets have been showing about vote fraud claims might actually protect them from the defamation lawsuits. They are "not the typical playbook for right-wing media, which prides itself on pugilism and delights in ignoring the liberals who have long complained about its content," Grynbaum writes. But like it or not, "litigation represents a new front in the war against misinformation, a scourge that has reshaped American politics, deprived citizens of common facts, and paved the way for the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol." Defamation lawsuits "shouldn\'t be the way to govern speech in our country," attorney Roberta Kaplan told the Times. "It\'s not an efficient or productive way to promote truth-telling or quality journalistic standards through litigating in court. But I think it\'s gotten to the point where the problem is so bad right now there\'s virtually no other way to do it." Fox News said in a statement it\'s "proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend" itself against Smartmatic\'s "meritless lawsuit."

CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told MSNBC\'s Rachel Maddow on Monday that "our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus" or get sick. "It\'s not just in the clinical trials, but it\'s also in real-world data," she added. Her comments seemed to be in reference to a CDC study released earlier on Monday that examined Moderna\'s and Pfizer\'s COVID-19 vaccines and found that in real-world conditions, they reduced the risk of infection by 90 percent two or more weeks after the second dose was administered. The CDC said the study demonstrated that the vaccines "can reduce both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections." Though Walensky expressed optimism over this finding and said "we can kind of almost see the end" of the pandemic based on the rate of vaccinations in the United States, she also reiterating her concern about COVID-19 cases ticking up. "What I really would hate to have happen is to have another oncoming surge just as we\'re reaching towards getting so many more people vaccinated," she said. Walensky had previously expressed similar concerns on Monday about a potential fourth surge in COVID-19 cases, saying in a briefing she has a feeling "of impending doom" while urging Americans to "please hold on a little while longer."

In fact, the drug marker didn’t accept government money for the project.Since then, another drug company has released results indicating a second, more accessible vaccine could be fast-tracked by the FDA by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci on Thursday also called the efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine “extraordinary,” adding it is almost as effective as the measles shot.On Friday, Trump made the outlandish suggestion that those drug companies deliberately withheld successful results until after the election as a revenge-fueled plot to kick him out of office due to his crusade against prescription drug prices.Rivera said that he wished the American people could honor Trump by crediting him for the speedy vaccine “because he is definitely the prime architect of this Operation Warp Speed.”To date, the coronavirus has killed at least 250,000 Americans and infected nearly 12 million—a grim milestone that is only expected to skyrocket as the holiday season and winter loom.On Friday night, Williams seemed to allude to the tragic reality of the virus surging across the nation, calling out the president for refusing to follow virus mitigation recommendations pushed by his own public health officials, like mask-wearing and social distancing.“We are all painfully aware life in America will not feel anything close to normal until the coronavirus vaccine has been perfected and really distributed,” he said during his late night show, “The 11th Hour.”During his monologue about Trump\'s “laser focus” on the pandemic, Williams jokingly highlighted the success rate of other products named after the president.“What Trump Steaks did for the hungry, what Trump Water did for the thirsty in our nation, what Trump University did to lift up the uneducated in our country, well along comes Trump: The Vaccine,” Williams quipped. “Possibilities, I think you’ll agree, are endless.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"So I\'m not really suffering financially."Cheryl K. Smith, an author and editor who lives in Low Pass, Oregon, isn\'t in a rush to spend the money, either. She plans to save a portion, too, while donating the rest to a local food bank. "I\'m actually saving money right now," Smith said.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesPresident Donald Trump\'s demand to increase the already-approved $600 individual payment to $2,000, with backing from congressional Democrats, has dominated events in Washington this week and redefined the debate for more stimulus during the pandemic. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Wednesday he would not allow a vote on a stand-alone bill increasing the checks to $2,000, dooming the effort, at least for now.Whatever the amount, the reality is that most Americans right now are much more likely to save the money they receive.Of course, the money will be a lifesaver for the roughly 20 million people collecting unemployment benefits and others who are working reduced hours or earning less than they used to. Yet, for the majority of the estimated 160 million individuals and families who will receive it, spending the money is expected not to be a high priority.After an earlier round of $1,200 stimulus checks went out in the spring, the saving rate skyrocketed and remains at a nearly 40-year high. That largely reflects the lopsided nature of the pandemic recession that has put some Americans in dire straits while leaving many others untouched.Economists on the right and left of the political spectrum said that when otherwise financially secure people receive an unexpected windfall, they almost invariably save it. The free-market economist Milton Friedman highlighted this phenomenon decades ago.Many experts said a truly stimulative package would have earmarked the payments for those who need it most -- the unemployed."We know where the pockets of need are," said Greg Daco, chief economist at Oxford Economics. "Putting it there would be a much more efficient use of the stimulus."And because the money will immediately be put to work -- the jobless don\'t have the luxury of saving it -- it would also have a much bigger impact on the overall economy, through what experts refer to as the multiplier effect. In essence, each dollar given to a person in need is likely to benefit the economy more because it would be used to pay for, say, groceries or rent."Providing $2,400 to a family of four in the same financial situation as they were at the end of 2019 doesn\'t do much to boost the overall economy right now," Daco said. "It\'s not whether it\'s a positive or not. It\'s their potency that\'s in question."Individuals with an adjusted gross income in 2019 of up to $75,000 will receive the $600 payment, and couples earning up to $150,000 a year will get twice that amount. There is also a $600 payment for each child in families that meet those income requirements. People making more than those limits will receive partial payments up to certain income thresholds.A more effective approach, experts say, would have raised unemployment insurance benefits to the jobless by $600 a week, matching the supplement under the stimulus package Congress passed last spring, rather than the $300 weekly subsidy the new legislation provides. Democrats had pushed for larger payments to the jobless and included it in legislation that passed the House, which they control. But the measure met stiff resistance from Republicans, who control the Senate, and was not included in the final compromise bill.The money could also have been used to extend two key unemployment programs for much longer than the 11 weeks provided for in the new bill. The current extension runs only until mid-March, well before mass vaccinations are expected later in the spring and summer and the economy begins to return to normal."The economy is going to remain limited by the pandemic for the next six to nine months," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.Roughly 20 million Americans are collecting unemployment benefits and the jobless rate stands at 6.7%. One year ago, it was 3.5%, a half-century low.And there are signs with the economy sputtering, more Americans are giving up -- more than half a million people stopped looking for work and dropped out of the labor force just last month, meaning they are no longer counted among the unemployed.To be sure, the money from Washington will be welcomed by most Americans, even if they are financially secure. Besides saving it, others will use it to pay down debt, or invest it.A study released in August by three economists, Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Michael Weber, found that recipients of the $1,200 payments sent out under the CARES Act last spring largely held off on spending the money. Only 15% of people said they had spent it, or planned to spend it. Most said they would save the cash or use it to pay down debt.Of course, some of the money flowing into the economy could soon reach those who need it most. And it will provide a financial cushion even for middle-class families who are secure by most measures but remain on edge from the turbulence of 2020.But in terms of the multiplier effect, it\'s likely to pale in comparison to the impact in the spring, when the unemployment rate was much higher and there were real fears the country could experience a second Great Depression."The more you hit the stimulus button, the less impact you see," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. And the hardest hit sectors -- dining, entertainment and travel -- are unlikely to see much of a boost now, since consumers are wary of going out or live in states like California and New York where restaurant dining and other activities are restricted.Anderson said the stimulus could heighten some of the inequality that has become evident during the past year. Many white-collar employees are working from home and have largely been spared layoffs -- the unemployment rate for college graduates is now just 4.2%.But lower-paid service workers have been hit hard and the jobless rate stands at 7.7% for people with just a high school diploma. Better-off households, Anderson said, might spend the money on stocks or put it toward a home purchase, which could "aggravate a bubble forming in some assets like equities and housing."Julia Bald, a librarian who lives in Beverly, Massachusetts, isn\'t looking to bet on the stock market but she plans to put her stimulus check in the bank as a precaution. If the virus surges again and the library has to close down, she fears that she could be laid off. Bald also has $10,000 in outstanding student loans, and is trying to save as much money as she can."I haven\'t had much financial difficulty, it\'s not like I have to worry about back rent or anything," said Bald, 30. "But my nervousness about where the economy could go from here makes me want to save it just in case."Dennis Helmstetter of Frederick, Maryland, also plans to save the $600 payment. He has managed to keep not one, but three jobs during the pandemic -- as a real estate agent, a clerk at Fort Detrick and as a supervisor of the bar and restaurant at his local Elks Lodge.Because he hasn\'t been spending on travel, dining out or entertainment, he has been able to save more money than usual: putting away about $1,000 each month. While he\'s glad to see the extra boost to his savings, Helmstetter, 65, believes that Congress should have targeted the most needy people more directly."I think they\'re barking up the wrong tree," he said. "The money should go to the people who are unemployed right now."Others who feel similarly to Helmstetter are taking it upon themselves to redistribute their payments to those facing financial hardship.Serena Cooper, 26, plans to donate all of her stimulus check to someone who is unemployed. Cooper, a public relations assistant in Los Angeles, said she feels "blessed" to have kept her job during the pandemic, despite her own financial worries. At $32,000 a year, her salary has left her struggling to pay rent and other bills."In no way am I rich," she said. "But I feel like my $600 would make a bigger impact on someone who has been dealing with struggles far worse than I have during this pandemic."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '38de27aaa48723eafeafd2fc4f6cf82c', 'title': "Biden Got the Vaccine Rollout Humming, With Trump's Help", 'description': 'WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden pledged last week to amass enough vaccine by late May to inoculate every adult in the United States, the pronouncement was greeted as a triumphant acceleration of a vaccination campaign that seemed to be faltering only weeks earlier. And it is true that production of two of the three federally authorized vaccines has sped up in part because of the demands and directives of the new president’s coronavirus team. But the announcement was also a triumph of another kind: public relations. Because Biden had tamped down expectations early, the quicker timetable for vaccine production conjured an image of a White House running on all cylinders and leaving its predecessor’s effort in the dust. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times A closer look at the ramp-up announced last week offers a more mixed picture, one in which the new administration expanded and bulked up a vaccine production effort whose key elements were in place when Biden took over for President Donald Trump. Both administrations deserve credit, although neither wants to grant much to the other. The Biden administration has taken two major steps that helped hasten vaccine production in the near term. Even before Biden was inaugurated, his aides determined that by invoking the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, the federal government could help Pfizer obtain the heavy machinery it needed to expand its plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The Trump administration had repeatedly invoked that law, but its order for Pfizer only covered single-use supplies like plastic liners, not durable factory equipment. Crucially, Biden’s top aides drove another vaccine manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, to force a key subcontractor into round-the-clock operations so its vaccine could be bottled faster. That company had fallen behind on the production targets laid out in its federal contract. Only after Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House’s chief pandemic adviser, and Dr. David Kessler, who oversees the vaccine effort, demanded the company commit more resources did it publicly pledge to meet a crucial deadline in May. At a White House vaccine “summit” Wednesday afternoon, Biden will announce that he intends to secure an additional 100 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson single-shot vaccine by the end of this year, with the goal of having enough on hand to vaccinate children and, if necessary, administer booster doses or reformulate the vaccine to combat emerging variants of the virus. At the same time, though, Biden benefited hugely from the waves of vaccine production that the Trump administration had set in motion. As both Pfizer and Moderna found their manufacturing footing, they were able to double and triple the outputs from their factories. Biden had been in office less than a month when Moderna announced that it could deliver 200 million doses by the end of May, a month earlier than scheduled, simply because it had become faster at production. Pfizer was able to shave off even more time, moving up the timetable to deliver its 200 million doses by a full two months, partly because of newfound efficiencies and partly because it was given credit for six doses per vial instead of five. All this enabled Biden to announce that his administration would have enough doses in hand by the end of May to cover all 257 million adults, two months earlier than he had promised just a few weeks earlier. His aides noted that on Sunday, the nation hit a daily record of 2.9 million shots, 3 1/2 times as many as were given on Inauguration Day. “Throughout our response, we’ve provided clear timelines based on the available, authorized vaccines,” said Kevin Munoz, a White House assistant press secretary. “We don’t plan to just meet these timelines, but rather to overperform them.” To Trump administration aides, the new president’s crowing rings off-key. Biden is proclaiming victory off his predecessor’s achievements while wrongly grumbling about a mess he says he inherited, they say. “They criticize what we did, but they are using our playbook every step of the way,” said Paul Mango, the Trump administration’s deputy chief of staff for health policy and a senior official in the crash vaccine development effort then known as Operation Warp Speed. He said Trump’s team oversaw the construction or expansion of nearly two dozen plants involved in vaccine production and invoked the Defense Production Act 18 times to ensure those factories had sufficient supplies. The Biden team is “maintaining a very nice trajectory,” Mango said. “But don’t criticize us to make yourselves look better.” Still, corporate, state and federal officials agree that Biden’s White House has been more active than his predecessor’s in trying to build up the nation’s vaccine stock. The new administration’s relationship with Pfizer is markedly better. Trump and his aides had accused the company of slow-walking its vaccine development to hurt Trump’s reelection bid. The company announced its vaccine was robustly effective on Nov. 9, nearly a week after Election Day, then filed its application for emergency use authorization on Nov. 20. Pfizer officials privately suggested that the Trump administration not only was wrongfully bad-mouthing the company but also had refused for months to invoke the Defense Production Act to order suppliers to prioritize Pfizer’s needs, as it did for the other vaccine developers under federal contract. Biden’s aides started talking to Pfizer executives about what the company needed to make more doses even before Inauguration Day. When Biden traveled to Michigan on Feb. 19 to visit Pfizer’s plant, Dr. Albert Bourla, the company’s chief executive, effusively praised the new administration as “a great ally,” saying officials had helped the company secure critical materials and equipment. The biggest piece of locking in enough doses to cover the nation’s adults before June was Johnson & Johnson. As recently as two weeks ago, Dr. Richard Nettles, Johnson & Johnson’s vice president for medical affairs in the United States, would say only that the company would supply 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million doses by the end of June. That fell short of its contract for 37 million doses by the end of March and 87 million by the end of May. Reuters reported Tuesday that Johnson & Johnson had informed European Union officials that production problems might delay shipments, and Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had heard similar warnings from the company. In the United States, the company’s biggest worry was getting the vaccine bottled by two subcontractors. That “fill-and-finish” work is divided between a plant in Michigan run by Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing, or GRAM, and a plant run by Catalent in Bloomington, Indiana. The Biden team pushed Johnson & Johnson to order GRAM to move from normal business hours to 24/7 operations, one senior administration official said. Another federal official said Johnson & Johnson was largely on track but did “scale up a bit faster” under pressure. Officials also brokered an unusual partnership between Johnson & Johnson and a longtime competitor, Merck & Co. The Trump administration repeatedly explored using Merck’s plants to bolster vaccine production but never reached an agreement. Zients, the pandemic adviser, said Sunday that the new alliance had helped the Biden administration set its new May goal. In fact, though, Merck is likely to bottle only a few million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine by then, according to people familiar with its operation. The main benefit of the partnership will come later in the year, when Merck will have retooled a huge plant with the capacity to produce as many as 100 million doses of vaccine a month, they said. Beyond the nuts and bolts of production, Biden’s White House has pursued a starkly different messaging campaign than Trump’s: underpromise, and then try to overdeliver. Trump routinely boasted of imminent achievements, including a vaccine rollout before Election Day, only to fall short. By contrast, health experts complained, at least initially, that Biden was overly cautious. When the vaccine rollout began in December, Biden vowed that his administration would average 1 million shots a day during his first 100 days in office — enough to vaccinate 50 million people by the end of March. After less than a week in office, he raised the goal by 50%, to 1.5 million shots per day. The nation passed Biden’s initial target about a month ahead of schedule and is now averaging 2.17 million doses per day. Carefully calibrated goals “avoid losses,” said David Axelrod, the senior strategist for President Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. “Certainly they must have learned that lesson from watching Trump.” “Internally, you drive to the highest possible goal you can make. Externally, you set a floor that you are reasonably confident you can achieve,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Revellers, many reportedly unmasked, became “unruly” after a teenager refused to move when police tried to clear crowds from a roadway on Friday night, according to an arrest affidavit. Police then used pepper spray. They said several people were detained while two officers were injured and taken to hospital. The following night, on Saturday, police said 30 arrests were made. A total of 100 people were arrested over the weekend, reported CNN. The popular spring break destination has seen packed beaches, sparking fears of coronavirus outbreaks. Florida does not permit local jurisdictions to fine people for not wearing masks. The mayor of Miami Beach, Dan Gelber, told CNN they were “seeing too much spring break activity”, adding: “We’ve got a problem with too many people coming here to let loose.”The Florida department of health reported 5,134 new cases on Friday, up from 4,444 on Monday. On Sunday there were 38,222 new cases in the US, according to Johns Hopkins data, and 572 new deaths. This compares to record highs recorded in January of 300,416 and 4,470. In total, to date there have been more than 29m cases and more than 534,000 people have died. While total new infections in the US are on a downward trajectory and vaccinations are rising, case numbers have stopped falling precipitously. On Sunday America’s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, warned: “We’re not out of the woods yet.” Pointing to what happened last spring and summer and the situation now, he told Fox News: “If you look at those numbers, that plateau [of case numbers] bothers me and other public health officials. When you plateau at a high level, there’s enough viral activity in the community that when you pull back on things like masking and not pay attention to avoiding congregate settings, it is very risky to get another surge.”Fauci criticised the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, for his decision to completely reopen businesses and remove a state mask mandate last week as “risky and potentially dangerous”. The mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, pleaded with residents to ignore the mandate by continuing to wear masks. “Each day, I am unfortunately reporting individuals who are passing away because of Covid-19,” he tweeted on Saturday. “Today, we are reporting 13 deaths. It is important for us to receive our Covid vaccines and continue to mask up. I strongly urge Houstonians to do so.” Vaccinations are picking up.

One of President Joe Biden’s executive orders aimed at curbing the pandemic asks government agencies to “assess the feasibility” of linking coronavirus vaccine certificates with other vaccination documents, and producing digital versions of them. Denmark’s government said Wednesday that in the next three to four months, it will roll out a digital passport that will allow citizens to show they have been vaccinated. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times It isn’t just governments that are suggesting vaccine passports. In a few weeks, Etihad Airways and Emirates will start using a digital travel pass, developed by the International Air Transport Association, to help passengers manage their travel plans and provide airlines and governments documentation that they have been vaccinated or tested for COVID-19. The challenge right now is creating a document or app that is accepted around the world, that protects privacy and is accessible to people regardless of their wealth or access to smartphones. Here’s what we know about the current status of digital vaccine passports. What is a vaccine pass or passport? A vaccination pass or passport is documentation proving that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Some versions will also allow people to show that they have tested negative for the virus, and therefore can more easily travel. The versions being worked on now by airlines, industry groups, nonprofits and technology companies will be something you can pull up on your mobile phone as an app or part of your digital wallet. “It’s about trying to digitize a process that happens now and make it into something that allows for more harmony and ease, making it easier for people to travel between countries without having to pull out different papers for different countries and different documents at different checkpoints,” said Nick Careen, senior vice president for airport, passenger, cargo and security at IATA. Careen has been leading IATA’s travel pass initiative. IATA is one of several organizations that have been working on digital solutions to streamline the travel credentialing process for years; during the pandemic, these groups have focused on including vaccination status. The idea is that if you have all the pertinent information on your phone, a significant amount of time will be saved. In addition to IATA, IBM has been developing its own Digital Health Pass that would enable individuals to present proof of vaccination or a negative test to gain access to a public location, such as a sports stadium, airplane, university or workplace. The pass, built on IBM’s blockchain technology, can utilize multiple data types, including temperature checks, virus exposure notifications, test results and vaccine status. The World Economic Forum and the Commons Project Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit group, have been testing a digital health passport called CommonPass, which would allow travelers to access testing or vaccination information. The pass would generate a QR code that could be shown to authorities. Why would I need a vaccine pass or passport? As more people are inoculated, there will likely be aspects of public life in which only people who have been vaccinated are allowed to participate. Take the upcoming Super Bowl LV in Tampa, Florida, where a significant portion of attendees will be vaccinated health care workers. (Careen of IATA said that sporting organizations, concert venues and tourism agencies have all reached out for identification tech support.) In order to travel internationally, government and health authorities will need to know if you have been vaccinated or have tested negative for the virus. Many countries are already requiring proof of a negative test for entry. Such passes could be essential to restarting the tourism industry, said Zurab Pololikashvili, secretary-general of the United Nations World Tourism Organization. “One key element vital for the restart of tourism is consistency and harmonization of rules and protocols regarding international travel,” he said in an email. “Evidence of vaccination, for example, through the coordinated introduction of what may be called ‘health passports’ can offer this. They can also eliminate the need for quarantine on arrival, a policy which is also standing in the way of the return of international tourism.” Dakota Gruener, executive director of ID2020, a global public-private partnership, said that there are three scenarios regarding digital credentialing for the coronavirus response. The first, which is largely off the table, is the creation of immunity certificates. These are documents that would show that people have developed some kind of immunity to the virus. The second scenario is being able to prove you’ve tested negative for the virus; the third is being able to show that you have been vaccinated. The last two scenarios, experts agree, are the most important for getting the travel industry going again. “We’re seeing a lot of interest from airlines, airline industry groups, customs and border control agencies and travelers, all saying, ‘How do I safely get on a plane or as a condition of entry into a country, get on a train, whatever the case may be, and prove that I have been tested or vaccinated?’” Gruener said. Gruener is one expert in a World Health Organization-sponsored group tasked with establishing global standards for digital vaccination certificates. Has this been done before? Having to prove you’ve been vaccinated in order to participate in activities or enter certain countries is not a new concept. For decades, people traveling to some countries have had to prove that they have been vaccinated against diseases such as yellow fever, rubella and cholera. Often, after being vaccinated, travelers received a signed and stamped “yellow card,” known as an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still urge people to take on relevant trips. “Everybody who has traveled internationally to countries that require vaccination against malaria, diphtheria and other things has had yellow cards,” said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Linux Foundation Public Health, a technology-focused organization helping public health authorities combat COVID-19 around the world. Its focus is helping projects, communities and companies build open-source technology. “Parents with kids in public school have had to prove their kids have been vaccinated. This is not something new.” But a major difference between the yellow card of years past and what is being worked on now is the digital component, which comes with new concerns around privacy and accessibility. The Linux Foundation is working in partnership with the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, a collective of more than 300 people from five continents to help develop universal standards for vaccine credential apps that make them accessible and equitable. The foundation is also working with IBM and CommonPass. “As these things get rolled out, it’s important for citizens to ask governments and airlines: How do we make this easy so I have one vaccination record to book a flight, hotel and so I can use that to do some other things,” Behlendorf said. “It should work like email. If it doesn’t, agitate for it.” Do vaccine passports have to be digital? Vaccine passports don’t have to be digital, but they would make the travel process smoother. “Imagine a future where a plane lands in an airport and a hundred people have a travel pass, 100 have another health wallet, 50 have bits of paper and another 25 have some kind of government document,” said Jamie Smith, senior director of business development at Evernym, a developer that has been working with IATA and others on developing a vaccine pass. “What does the airport do? How do they process all those people in a standard, simple way?” The European Union’s law enforcement agency said this week that sales of fake negative test results are becoming more widespread, another reason the industry is trying to develop digital passes that are secure. What are the objections to vaccine passports? In a world where more than 1 billion people aren’t able to prove their identity because they lack passports, birth certificates, driver’s licenses or national identification cards, digital documents that show vaccine status may heighten inequality and risk, leaving many people behind. That concern has been at the heart of Gruener’s work. “Long predating COVID, we were working on the intersection of digital credentials and immunization,” she said. “It’ll be years before vaccines are universally available on a global level, and thus widespread testing is going to continue and must continue alongside vaccination to enable a safe and equitable return to travel and other public activities.” For those without smartphones, the industry says it will accept paper proof, but even that needs to be standardized. In addition, there are concerns about privacy and data sharing. “There are ways this could be done right or done terribly wrong and the wrong ways could lead us to a techno dystopia,” said Jenny Wanger, director of programs at the Linux Foundation, adding that it’s important that the tech-building aspect of these apps be done in the open and doesn’t end up in the control of any one government or company. The technology should be open source and accessible to technologists, no matter who they are or where they are, she and others said. What are the challenges to creating these digital passes? Technologists and travel industry experts said that although it is possible to rush tech solutions that allow people to have one-use apps, creating long-lasting ethical technology or systems that will not store people’s data, or make it possible to track where they are, takes time. “The global passport system took 50 years to develop,” said Drummond Reed, chief trust officer for Evernym. “Even when they wanted to add biometrics to that to make it stronger, that took over a decade to agree on just how you’re going to add a fingerprint or a facial biometric to be verified on a passport. Now, in a very short period of time, we need to produce a digital credential that can be as universally recognized as a passport and it needs an even greater level of privacy because it’s going to be digital.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Read on to see how you can avoid getting sick and dying—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Get Your Vaccine When It’s Available to You—it’s Safe, He Promises Dr. Fauci says the vaccine is safe and effective; don’t be concerned that it was developed in under a year, he says. “It is historic,” he admitted. “The sequence of the new virus was made public on the 9th of January of 2020. And in December of last year, the first doses went into the arms of people following a vaccine trial—plural—since there were two of them, that show the 94 to 95% efficacy under most circumstances of vaccinology, this would have taken several years to accomplish. And so people don\'t get the wrong impression: The speed did not sacrifice safety, nor did it sacrifice, scientific integrity. It was a reflection of the really breathtaking advances in the science of vaccine platform technology and the enormous amount of investment that was made to essentially manufactured doses of the vaccine.” 2 Wear Your Mask—Even if You Have Been Vaccinated “You should wear a mask” even if you have gotten your vaccine, said Fauci. “And the reason is the primary endpoint for the vaccine efficacy was whether it prevented you from getting clinically recognizable disease. It certainly prevents you from getting severe disease. But what we don\'t know yet is whether it prevents you from getting asymptomatic infection. In other words, does the vaccine prevent you from actually getting the virus that replicates in your nasal pharynx? So since we don\'t know that yet it is recommended that you wear a mask." 3 Avoid “Crowds in Congregate Settings, Particularly Indoors” “You want to stay away from places like bars where people congregate—and in some places you’re even seeing authorities closing bars,” Fauci has said in the past. But the same goes for groups of people—family or friends—indoors in homes. If you don’t shelter with the person, don’t let them in. 4 Observe “Physical Distancing” Even if wearing a mask, still stay six feet away. The CDC explains why clearly: “COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs." 5 You’ve Got to Follow These Measures at Least Until Fall “Until we get the overwhelming majority of people in the population, and I would imagine that would be about 70 to 85%—if we get them vaccinated, we\'ll get to a level of what we call herd immunity, which means that there\'ll be very little opportunity for the virus to circulate in the community,” said Fauci. “When that occurs, then you could pull back a bit on the public health measures, but until that occurs, there\'s still going to be a lot of virus circulating in the community. And that\'s the reason why we continue to recommend strongly that people abide by the public health measures.”RELATED: If You Feel This, You May Have Already Had COVID, Says Dr. Fauci 6 How to Survive This Pandemic As for yourself, follow Fauci’s fundamentals and help end this surge, no matter where you live—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don\'t go indoors with people you\'re not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Butch Bowers and Deborah Barbier, who were expected to be two of the lead attorneys, are out, as are Josh Howard, Johnny Gasser, and Greg Howard. No other attorneys have announced they were involved with the case, so it appears that, for now, Trump is defenseless. The lawyers reportedly left because of a disagreement over legal strategy. Trump reportedly wanted them to push his unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in last year\'s presidential election rather than focus on whether convicting a former president after he\'s out of office is constitutional, an argument that appears to be the consensus among Republicans and the reason he\'ll likely be acquitted. Bowers, a source said, lacked chemistry with Trump and the decision to leave was reportedly mutual. It\'s unclear where Trump will go from here - his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani reportedly wants to take the case, but he\'s a potential witness in the trial because he spoke at the rally preceding the deadly Capitol riot Trump is accused of inciting, and the Times notes "almost all" of Trump\'s advisers blame Giuliani for the impeachment in the first place.

{'_id': '4daff1b06b2fe59c084de23fd42c3166', 'title': "U.S. Rushes to Expand Vaccine Eligibility in a 'Race Against Time'", 'description': 'CHICAGO — Officials in at least 18 states have committed in recent days to opening coronavirus vaccine appointments to all adults in March or April, part of a fast-moving expansion as states race to meet President Joe Biden’s goal of universal eligibility by May 1. In Ohio, all adults will be allowed to seek shots starting March 29. In Connecticut, April 5. In Alaska and Mississippi, all adults are already able to book appointments. And Thursday, officials in Illinois, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Maryland and Missouri said that all adults would be allowed in April to sign up for a shot, while Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah said universal eligibility would begin there next week. But even as the pace of vaccinations has accelerated to about 2.5 million shots each day nationwide, the country finds itself at a precarious point in the pandemic. Cases, deaths and hospitalizations have all fallen sharply from January peaks, yet infection levels have plateaued this month, at about 55,000 new cases a day. While governors relax restrictions on businesses like bars, indoor gyms and casinos, highly infectious variants are spreading and some states, especially on the East Coast, have struggled for weeks to make any progress in reducing cases. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “I think it is a race against time,” said Dr. Stephen J. Thomas, SUNY Upstate Medical University’s chief of infectious disease. “Every single person that we can get vaccinated or every single person that we can get a mask on is one less opportunity that a variant has.” As parts of the country continue to see progress, many Americans are booking spring break trips, dining in newly reopened restaurants and replanning summer weddings that were abruptly canceled in 2020. All the while, the path ahead — and public guidance about how people should behave in this moment — seems uncertain, even contradictory. Although deaths have dropped considerably in New York, progress in reducing cases has stalled. The state has more recent cases per capita than everywhere except New Jersey, and the New York City metro area has the country’s second-highest rate of new infections, behind only Idaho Falls, Idaho. “People will be reckless; I don’t know how else to say it,” said Carol Greenberg, a pet care worker in Jersey City, New Jersey, who said she worried that people were starting to act in ways that did not accurately reflect the number of new virus cases in that state, where more than 26,000 new infections have been reported in the past week. Greenberg, 61, has been fully vaccinated, but her adult children have not, and she said she wondered whether all the reopening announcements of late were wise. In recent days, Gov. Phil Murphy urged a return to in-person instruction at New Jersey schools and announced a loosening of restrictions at restaurants, bars, salons and other businesses. No vaccine has yet been authorized for use in people under 16, though trials are underway to see if they are safe and effective in children. Public health researchers said they viewed the current moment in the pandemic as a sprint between vaccinations and newly confirmed cases of the virus, particularly infections that are spreading because of variants that can be more contagious. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, warned Friday “that it’s really quite risky to declare victory before you have the level of infection in the community to a much, much lower level than 53,000 cases per day.” “So it is unfortunate, but not surprising, to me that you are seeing increases in number of cases per day in areas — cities, states or regions — even though vaccines are being distributed at a pretty good clip of 2 to 3 million per day,” Fauci said. In Chicago, where students in the nation’s third-largest public school system have returned to classrooms, and where parks, bars and movie theaters are reopened, city officials announced that restaurant employees, construction workers and people who have preexisting health conditions would be newly eligible for vaccination by the end of March. Cook County, which includes Chicago, has averaged between 600 and 700 cases each day for nearly a month, down from about 4,500 cases a day at its November peak. “We’ve weathered a lot of storms over the course of this year,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said after visiting a vaccination site this week. “We’ve got to stay diligent. We’ve got to continue to work hard. But we are moving exactly in the right directions.” Still, the city’s usual outsize enthusiasm for observing a springtime ritual — going out on St. Patrick’s Day — was muted, at best. On Wednesday, few pedestrians were wandering on downtown streets, typically packed with revelers on the holiday. The Chicago River had been dyed its traditional bright shade of green, but the popular Riverwalk alongside it was nearly empty. Jacob Roberts, 29, was downtown Wednesday, taking a vacation from his home in Washington state. The trip to Chicago was a bucket-list visit he had always wanted to take. “I was cooped up in Washington and getting sick of everybody looking kind of down in the dumps,” he said. “But it’s honestly the same thing everywhere you look right now.” Although tourism has yet to return in force in places like New York and Chicago, the country’s outlook in battling the virus appears far better than when winter began. No state is reporting case numbers anywhere near record levels, and the sort of explosive case growth seen in hard-hit areas through 2020 has almost completely abated. Kansas is averaging about 215 new coronavirus cases a day, down from more than 2,000 in early January. In California, around 2,900 cases are reported most days, down from about 40,000 in mid-January. And North Dakota, which has the country’s most known cases per capita, is now regularly adding fewer than 100 cases a day, in a state with a population of 762,000. A projection by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation suggests that coronavirus cases will continue to slowly decline in the United States in the coming months. But with most Americans still unvaccinated and variants continuing to spread, there are warning signs in the data. Vermont, which escaped the worst of the pandemic in 2020, has struggled all of this year to curb an outbreak. Michigan, which had appeared to bring the virus under control in January, has seen case numbers increase by more than 80% over the past two weeks, though they remain well below their December peak. In South Florida, infection levels have remained persistently high, with about 1,000 cases reported each day in a single county, Miami-Dade. Even in states where the virus appeared far from under control, officials have proceeded to lift restrictions on businesses, and companies have pushed for reopenings. On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York announced that indoor fitness classes may resume Monday. In Southern California, where cases peaked early this winter, officials at Disneyland said that after more than a year of being closed, the theme park would open April 30 with rules in place limiting capacity. Around the country, some people said they were hesitant to dive back into old routines, even if their elected officials have indicated that it is permissible to do so. “I used to be regular at a gym twice a week or so, and I haven’t been since last February at all,” said Paul Eustice, 64, who lives in downtown Chicago. “I will not go in there where people are breathing heavily.” Last week, U.S. air travel rose to its highest level since the pandemic hit, and airline executives said that bookings in the coming months indicate an eagerness from Americans to begin traveling in large numbers again. Some of them are among the newly vaccinated. Since vaccinations began in December, the federal government has delivered more than 151 million vaccine doses, and about 77% have been administered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday, 66% of the country’s older population had received at least one vaccine dose, according to CDC data, with 39% fully vaccinated. At least 23 states have said they will expand vaccine eligibility to their general population on or before May 1, the deadline that Biden set last week, and officials have spoken more openly about what life might be like when the pandemic ends. “As more Montanans get the vaccine,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said as he announced that all Montana adults would be eligible April 1, “we will begin to approach the time when we are no longer in a state of emergency and we can remove our masks and throw them in the trash.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Phill Magoke/AFP via Getty ImagesEditor’s note: On Tuesday, Feb. 24, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released the results of its trial of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine. The FDA found the vaccine to be safe and effective and it is expected to grant emergency use authorization in the coming days. Maureen Ferran, a virologist at the Rochester Institute of Technology, explains how this new vaccine works and explores the differences between it and the already approved Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines. How does the Johnson & Johnson vaccine work? The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is what’s called a viral vector vaccine. To create this vaccine, the Johnson & Johnson team took a harmless adenovirus – the viral vector – and replaced a small piece of its genetic instructions with coronavirus genes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After this modified adenovirus is injected into someone’s arm, it enters the person’s cells. The cells then read the genetic instructions needed to make the spike protein and the vaccinated cells make and present the spike protein on their own surface. The person’s immune system then notices these foreign proteins and makes antibodies against them that will protect the person if they are ever exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the future. The adenovirus vector vaccine is safe because the adenovirus can’t replicate in human cells or cause disease, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can’t cause COVID–19 without the rest of the coronavirus. This approach is not new. Johnson & Johnson used a similar method to make its Ebola vaccine, and the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine is also an adenovirus viral vector vaccine. With only one dose, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is 72% effective at preventing severe COVID-19. Anastasia Usenko/iStock via Getty Images How effective is it? The FDA’s analysis found that, in the U.S., the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was 72% effective at preventing all COVID-19 and 86% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease. While there is still a chance a vaccinated person could get sick, this suggests they would be much less likely to need hospitalization or to die from COVID-19. A similar trial in South Africa, where a new, more contagious variant is dominant, produced similar results. Researchers found the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to be slightly less effective at preventing all illness there – 64% overall – but was still 82% effective at preventing severe disease. The FDA report also indicates that the vaccine protects against other variants from Britain and Brazil too. How is it different from the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? The most basic difference is that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is an adenovirus vector vaccine, while the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are both mRNA vaccines. Messenger RNA vaccines use genetic instructions from the coronavirus to tell a person’s cells to make the spike protein, but these don’t use another virus as a vector. There are many practical differences, too. Both of the mRNA-based vaccines require two shots. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only a single dose. This is key when vaccines are in short supply. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can also be stored at much warmer temperatures than the mRNA vaccines. The mRNA vaccines must be shipped and stored at below–freezing or subzero temperatures and require a complicated cold chain to safely distribute them. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be stored for at least three months in a regular refrigerator, making it much easier to use and distribute. As for efficacy, it is difficult to directly compare the Johnson & Johnson vaccine with the mRNA vaccines due to differences in how the clinical trials were designed. While the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are reported to be approximately 95% effective at preventing illness from COVID–19, the trials were done over the summer and fall of 2020, before newer more contagious variants were circulating widely. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines might not be as effective against the new variants, and Johnson & Johnson trials were done more recently and take into account the vaccine’s efficacy against these new variants. Should I choose one type of vaccine over another? Although the overall efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines is higher than the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you should not wait until you have your choice of vaccine – which is likely a long way off anyway. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is nearly as good as the mRNA-based vaccines at preventing serious disease, and that’s what really matters. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine and other viral-vector vaccines like the one from AstraZeneca are particularly important for the global vaccination effort. From a public health perspective, it’s important to have multiple COVID-19 vaccines, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a very welcome addition to the vaccine arsenal. It doesn’t require a freezer, making it much easier to ship and store. It’s a one-shot vaccine, making logistics much easier compared with organizing two doses per person. As many people as possible need to be vaccinated as quickly as possible to limit the development of new coronavirus variants. Johnson & Johnson is expected to ship out nearly four million doses as soon as the FDA grants emergency use authorization. Having a third authorized vaccine in the U.S. will be a big step towards meeting vaccination demand and stopping this pandemic.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

{'_id': 'b54d06254bad7f5bc2ebe5c0d67b816d', 'title': "Seniors Seeking Vaccines Have a Problem: They Can't Use the Internet", 'description': 'Annette Carlin feels trapped. Before the pandemic, Carlin, who is 84, loved to go on walks in Novato, California, with her grandchildren and dance at the senior center. Since March, though, she has been stuck indoors. She has been eager to sign up for a vaccine and begin returning to normal life. But booking an appointment has been a technological nightmare. Carlin cannot afford to buy a computer and would not know how to navigate the internet in search of a shot even if she could. While members of her family might be able to help her there, she avoids seeing them as a safety precaution. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It’s very frustrating,” Carlin said on her flip phone. “I feel like everybody else got the vaccine, and I didn’t.” The chaotic vaccine rollout has come with a maze of confusing registration pages and clunky health care websites. And the technological savvy required to navigate the text alerts, push notifications and email reminders that are second nature to the digital generation has put older adults like Carlin, who need the vaccine the most, at a disadvantage. As a result, seniors who lack tech skills are missing out on potentially lifesaving shots. The digital divide between generations has always been stark, but the pandemic’s abrupt curtailing of in-person interactions has made that division even more apparent. Advocates for older Americans, 22 million of whom lack wired broadband access at home, say it is ridiculous that a program mostly aimed at vaccinating vulnerable seniors is so dependent on internet know-how, Twitter announcements and online event pages. “We’re running into a crisis where connectivity is a life-or-death alternative for people,” said Tom Kamber, executive director of Older Adults Technology Services, a nonprofit that trains seniors to use technology. “It couldn’t get much more stark than people being told, ‘If you go outside, you’re likely to be at risk of dying.’” People in nursing homes, among the first to get vaccines, had staff to assist them. But when vaccines became available to a wider group of older adults in late December and early January, many who lived alone had to navigate the rollout by themselves. Federal agencies like the Administration for Community Living, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as nonprofits say they are doing what they can to guide older adults, but they are stretched thin. (Seniors can call the Administration for Community Living’s Eldercare Locator number for assistance at 1-800-677-1116.) “I don’t know where to go,” said Cheyrl Lathrop, a 74-year-old resident of Richmond, Virginia, who has watched younger, more tech-literate people nearby find ways to be vaccinated. “I get frustrated with the computer, and then I just give up.” Some seniors are relying on younger relatives to browse websites and stay up at all hours in hopes of booking a slot. Lathrop’s daughter, Sheri Blume, got her mother an appointment after weeks of searching. Terez Mays-Jones of Alpharetta, Georgia, had a similar experience looking for shots in Cincinnati, where her 73-year-old mother, Jacqueline Sims, lives. “It became a secondary job,” Mays-Jones, 53, said. “I was doing all these searches at all times of the day and evening.” Sims knows her way around Facebook and Instagram but still sometimes relies on her daughter for help online and said older adults often felt “intimidated” by technology. “At our age, we’re not used to making so many mistakes, or we don’t want to admit to our mistakes,” said Sims, who eventually secured a shot thanks to a tip from a cousin. Plenty of seniors do feel comfortable texting, tweeting and surfing the internet. But for those who do not, taking the time to learn a new skill often feels daunting, Kamber said. Older Adults Technology Services has taught 48,000 people how to get started online since the pandemic began, he said, and operates a tech support hotline. When vaccine sign-ups began, staff on the phones fielded thousands of questions about how to book appointments. Area Agencies on Aging, part of a national aging network funded by the federal government and overseen by the Administration for Community Living, are also helping out. Local chapters have been calling seniors and helping them register for vaccine appointments over the phone or in person, said Sandy Markwood, chief executive of the Area Agencies, which include more than 600 nonprofit regional centers that are guided by state governments. In Akron, Ohio, 78-year-old Lee Freund said every hospital, pharmacy and grocery store she had called in search of a vaccine directed her to a series of confusing webpages. Freund managed to accidentally sign up for grocery delivery but had no luck wrangling a shot. She ended up in tears. “When you’re alone, it’s frustrating, it’s overwhelming, and it’s very emotional,” said Freund, whose husband died last year. She said she did not call her children for help because she did not want to be a burden. “It almost made me think, ‘I don’t think that this is worth it.’” Freund finally found help with the nearby Area Agency on Aging, where a woman secured her an appointment. As of Thursday, about 24 million Americans ages 65 and older, or about 41%, had received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose, according to population and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., who has reintroduced a bill from last year that would allocate money to help get older Americans online, said the government had failed to get out ahead of a preventable crisis by not funding senior agencies sooner. Aging-network organizations “have been overwhelmed by the needs and the demands that they have and are struggling themselves working through the pandemic,” Smith said in an interview. “We have underresourced this, and we are seeing the effects of it.” The coronavirus relief bill passed by the House includes $470 million for supportive services for older Americans, including vaccine outreach. The Administration for Community Living is working with the CDC on a public awareness campaign for seniors, said Edwin Walker, the group’s deputy assistant secretary for aging. But that initiative is still in the planning stage. In the meantime, volunteer groups have popped up to help. In Miami, Katherine Quirk and her fiance, Russ Schwartz, started a Facebook group in January to disseminate information about vaccine availability in their area. The group has ballooned into 27,000 members seeking help and offering tips, and the effort has helped thousands get vaccinated. “It’s amazing, overwhelming,” said Quirk, 44, a nurse. “We’ve been called vaccine angels.” For those still waiting for their shot, though, hope seems far away. In Novato, Carlin spends her time watching the news on television in case there is a mention of where to get a shot. A granddaughter has been trying to find one for her, but without success. “I’m used to getting out and going and going and doing everything,” she said. If she were vaccinated, “I could go on with life, but now I feel like I’m on hold.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '49cebc0ba63129014717c5566350f366', 'title': 'Fauci Is Not Your God', 'description': 'Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief pandemic adviser to President Joe Biden, is a bureaucrat. He’s not our parent, or our personal physician, or a shaman, or our life coach. “We’ve done worse than most any other country,” Fauci told ABC over the weekend. “And we’re a highly developed rich country.” Fauci went on to say that the United States — on the verge of a ghastly milestone of 500,000 COVID deaths — had failed because of “disparate responses of different states versus the unified approach.” This story of American ineptitude in the face of a pandemic, popular among statists, pessimists, and left-wingers pining for federalized control over states, is a myth. The United States has performed just as well as most Western nations, where fatality rates are between 100 and 190 per 100,000, with variations most likely due to density, climate, inherent social behavior, or, one imagines, reasons yet to be figured out. This is true before we even begin taking into consideration the disparity in ways nations count fatalities, the meticulousness with which they count them, or the transparency with which they report them. Countries such as Britain, Belgium, Italy, and Portugal have somewhat higher fatality rates, and others such as Spain, Sweden, and France have a somewhat lower rate, but there’s no evidence that a more centralized plan would have saved American lives during the pandemic. The British, for instance, employ centralized control, with not only a single-payer health-insurance model but also a state that owns all medical facilities and employs all the medical personnel. Yet, to this point, Britain has fared worse during COVID than the United States by every quantifiable measure. The problems with a centralized approach in a massive and free nation such as the United States, on the other hand, are quite evident. A “unified approach” in this country means the Fauci approach. And the Fauci approach would mean an Andrew Cuomo approach. “We know that, when you do it properly, you bring down those cases. We have done it. We have done it in New York,” Fauci explained on PBS NewsHour back in July 2020. He would keep celebrating Cuomo’s model for the next six months. New York has a higher coronavirus fatality rate than any country in the Western world. It is a place low in civil liberties and high in death toll. A Faucian centralized plan would have entailed strict lockdowns of the economy and the implementation of policies that compelled nursing homes in states such as Florida, with a high number of vulnerable elderly, to accept thousands of infected people. As it stands now, Florida’s fatality rate is nearly half of that in New Jersey or in Fauci’s exemplar, New York. The lowest fatality rates in the country are in places such as Vermont and Utah and in Hawaii and Alaska. Why would they want to adopt New York’s approach? Perhaps island states or states with sparse populations and their social habits are better off fighting coronavirus without the federal government’s intervention. Why should we trust Fauci with a national plan? Back in March, Fauci famously told Americans, “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.” (Fauci now says we should wear two masks. No thanks, Dad.) The revisionist retelling of this comment has Fauci heroically averting a run on masks, but in reality, he detailed the many negative “consequences” of wearing them. It’s not surprising that health officials made mistakes in the early days of the pandemic. But why would we want Fauci empowered to transform his mistakes into national decrees? In the early days of the pandemic, Fauci kept citing the estimate of 60–70 percent vaccination for reaching herd immunity. Later, he began saying “70, 75 percent.” Then he went to “75, 80, 85 percent.” He later admitted he was lying, because “polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine.” I’m sorry the Constitution is inhibiting Fauci’s work, but he is a public-health official. His job is to relay information to the public, not to threaten doom, or coax or trick us into doing things. Yet even now, despite the immensely promising results of the vaccination program (the United States, incidentally, easily outperforms the European Union’s “unified approach”), Fauci is underplaying the effectiveness of the vaccine for the same reasons, one suspects, that he misled us about herd immunity. Even when most American are immunized, Fauci says, we won’t be back to “normal” until new infections drop “to a baseline that’s so low, it is virtually no threat.” This is a disqualifying statement — an insane standard that no free society would ever indulge. For Fauci, herd immunity is effectively 99 percent. Perhaps it’s understandable that an immunologist such as Fauci, who will continue to make more money than any other official in the United States government through all of this, isn’t very alarmed about the economic, social, and constitutional tradeoffs that accompany his approach. For a year, any criticism of Fauci was immediately slotted into the alleged debate between Donald Trump vs. “science.” But it’s Fauci’s technocratic instincts, not science, that makes him more likely to praise Chicom’s lackeys at the World Health Organization than the resilience of the United States. Which is one reason why the press should never have canonized Fauci in the first place; but his preening, deceptive performance is another great reason America should avoid a “unified approach” to policy.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '6b57a80c78726b723b54434f68e4e674', 'title': 'Bill Gates, the Virus and the Quest to Vaccinate the World', 'description': 'The head of one of the world\'s largest vaccine manufacturers had a problem. Adar Poonawalla, chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, needed $850 million so he could begin producing doses of promising coronavirus vaccines for the world\'s poor.Poonawalla calculated that he could risk $300 million of his company\'s money but would still be more than $500 million short. So he looked to a retired software executive in Seattle.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBill Gates, the Microsoft founder turned philanthropist, had known Poonawalla for years. Gates had spent billions to help bring vaccines to the developing world, working closely with pharmaceutical executives to transform the market. In doing so, he became the most powerful -- and provocative -- private player in global health.By the end of their conversation this summer, Gates had made a promise: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would provide a $150 million guarantee so the Indian factory could move ahead with production. By September, the foundation had doubled its commitment.It is part of an $11 billion effort to lay the groundwork to procure coronavirus vaccines for more than 150 countries, though it could eventually cost more. Funded largely with public money, the initiative is led by two global nonprofits that Gates helped launch and bankroll, along with the World Health Organization, which relies on the Gates Foundation as one of its largest donors.Working behind the scenes is the world\'s second-richest man, neither a scientist nor a doctor, who sees himself and his $50 billion foundation as uniquely prepared to take a central part. Gates and his team are drawing on connections and infrastructure the foundation has built over two decades to help guide the effort."We know how to work with governments. We know how to work with pharma. We\'ve thought about this scenario," Gates said in a recent interview. "We need -- at least in terms of expertise and relationships -- to play a very, very key role here."As the first vaccine candidates sprint toward regulatory approval, the question of how to immunize much of the world population has taken on added urgency. But nine months in, the success of the vaccine effort, known as Covax, is not at all certain.So far, it has pulled in only $3.6 billion in funding for research, manufacturing and subsidies for poor countries. Three companies have promised to deliver vaccines, but it is not yet known whether they will be effective. And it may be difficult to secure the necessary billions of doses in an affordable, timely way because the United States and other wealthy countries have cut separate deals for their citizens.In recent months, Gates has hosted online roundtables with drug company officials. He has pursued financial commitments from world leaders. He has consulted frequently with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s chief infectious disease expert and a longtime collaborator on vaccine initiatives. And to help staff the vaccine effort, his foundation has provided millions of dollars for McKinsey & Co. consultants.If the initiative, aided by Gates\' fortune and focus, manages to help protect the world\'s poor from a virus that has already killed more than 1.3 million people, it will affirm the strategies he has promoted in his philanthropic work, including incentives for drug companies.If the endeavor falls short, however, it could intensify calls for a more radical approach.Amid the pandemic, some public health officials and advocates argue that vaccine-makers, many of which have benefited from unprecedented public funding, should be compelled to share their technology, data and know-how to maximize production. India and South Africa, for example, are pushing to suspend the global enforcement of intellectual property rights involving the virus.Dr. Zweli Lawrence Mkhize, South Africa\'s health minister, said that the usual practices did not apply in this crisis. "There has to be a degree of broader consultation that looks at what is best for humanity," he said.In the current plan for a global vaccine deal, poor countries would receive only enough doses to inoculate 20% of their populations by the end of next year. Some models show that there will not be enough vaccines to cover the entire world until 2024."The consequence of longtime Gates strategies is that they go along with corporate control over supply," said Brook Baker, a Northeastern University law professor and policy analyst for Health GAP, which advocates equitable access to drugs. "In a pandemic, that is a real problem."Meanwhile, officials from some countries participating in the vaccine initiative complain that they were barely consulted until recently. "They are pushing us, cornering us, in order to make us pay," Juan Carlos Zevallos, Ecuador\'s health minister, said of the deal-makers. "We don\'t have a choice about which vaccine we would like to use. It is whatever they impose on us."\'The Bill Chill\'As a novel coronavirus linked to a live animal market began spreading rapidly in Wuhan, China, Gates watched from his office outside Seattle.On Feb. 14, he and leaders at his foundation, fearing a global threat, gathered to plan a response.Two weeks later, Dr. Seth Berkley -- chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a nonprofit the Gates philanthropy helped found -- flew to Seattle. He and Gates considered how to get COVID-19 vaccines to the developing world. On March 13, two days after the WHO declared a global pandemic, Gates conferred online with 12 top pharmaceutical executives, including the heads of Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, both of which have leading vaccine candidates.Gates became interested in immunizations in the late 1990s. Vaccines involved creating new technology, his specialty. Their impact was measurable; inexpensive doses could protect hundreds of millions against devastating disease. They were also about making deals.Many Western drug companies had stopped producing vaccines back then, finding them unprofitable. But through his giving, Gates helped create a new business model involving subsidies, advance market commitments and volume guarantees. The incentives drew in more manufacturers, resulting in many more lifesaving vaccinations.With a $100 million initial pledge, Gates helped create the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to invest in drugs and experimental vaccines. The foundation, which has about 1,600 employees, also funded academic researchers, installed its executives on the boards of multiple nonprofits and directly invested in drug companies.One of them was the German company BioNTech, which got a $55 million equity investment in September 2019. The business, partnering with Pfizer, announced last week that their jointly developed COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be 95% effective, and applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization.Some public health officials disagreed with Gates\' priorities, arguing that he should have directed more money to health systems. Others worried about a private individual wielding so much influence. But few people publicly criticized his foundation, fearful of losing its support. That self-censorship was so widespread it acquired a nickname: "the Bill Chill."At times, frictions were evident with the WHO, the United Nations agency charged with international public health. Gates felt frustrated with what he viewed as the organization\'s rigid bureaucracy and constraints on dealing with the private sector.Some at the WHO had concerns about his growing reach."The Gates Foundation presence has been, at best, an adjunct to WHO and at worst a hostile takeover and a usurpation," said Amir Attaran, a University of Ottawa professor of law and medicine.Today, the foundation and the WHO stress their mutual respect for each other.Capitalism at Work In March, Gates was urging drugmakers to move fast, cooperate with one another, open up their libraries of drug compounds and even share production responsibilities.The Gates Foundation employs former pharmaceutical executives in its top ranks. Working with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, they helped steer money into COVID-19 vaccine candidates and biotechnologies that could be quickly manufactured and suitable for the developing world.Some public health advocates and on-the-ground providers like Doctors Without Borders thought Gates was doing too little to pursue equitable access to vaccines and was too aligned with the pharmaceutical industry."Part of what they like about him is, he\'s protecting their way of life," James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that works to expand access to medical technology, said of Gates and drug industry executives.He and others believed that vaccine-makers would not maximize production for the developing world, especially when rich countries were clamoring for doses, because it wouldn\'t serve their bottom line. India and South Africa, in asking the World Trade Organization not to enforce coronavirus-related intellectual property rights, were seeking a way to wrest control of vaccines from big companies and ramp up local manufacturing.But Gates and many public health experts thought that most companies were taking laudable steps to help ensure access, such as nonprofit pricing and licensing of their technology to other manufacturers. They argued that drugmakers wouldn\'t take on the costly process of creating new products if their lucrative patents were jeopardized and that their control over their vaccines would ensure quality and safety."This capitalism thing -- there actually are some domains that actually works in," Gates said. "North Korea doesn\'t have that many vaccines, as far as we can tell."\'Acting Like a Lobbyist\'It was May 4, and the Gateses were on a video call with Boris Johnson. They congratulated the British prime minister on the birth of his son and asked about the COVID-19 case that had sent him to the hospital.Then they made their pitch: The world would never be safe from the virus and the global economy would never recover unless poor countries received vaccines and treatments too.Bill Gates had a long record of getting rich countries to provide funding for public health initiatives in poorer countries. Politicians saw him as a steward of public dollars with a nose for good investments.Leaders of wealthy countries were asked not only to help fund the initiative -- which was supporting development of nine potential vaccines -- but also to buy doses for their own populations.Companies either would charge all countries the same price or set tiered prices for low-, middle- and high-income nations; any could bow out if the price exceeded $21 per dose. Poor countries could get cheap, subsidized doses for up to 20% of their populations by the end of next year, but the wealthier nations could sign up for more.With so much attention on wealthy nations, there was little consultation with those the effort was intended to help most. It wasn\'t until the fall that lower-income countries learned they would have to pay $1.60 or $2 per dose, a significant price that would require some to secure bank loans or grants."It\'s going to be subsidized, yes, but countries still have to budget for their copay amount," said Chizoba Barbara Wonodi, the Nigeria director at the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. "So they need to be at the table when those discussions are made."Some middle-income countries have also felt squeezed, asked to pay prices in a higher tier, with little say as to what they would get or when they would get it.Zevallos, the Ecuadorian health minister, said he had spoken with fellow ministers in the region about raising concerns through their presidents. "They say, \'You don\'t get to choose, but you pay,\'" Zevallos said. "I\'m disappointed."Berkley, the Gavi director, acknowledged the frustration. "Did we communicate with everybody as well as we should? Absolutely not," he said. "But we did our best to try to do that."At the same time, Berkley said, "have we brought together the entire world to discuss equitable access to vaccines? Have we raised substantial amounts of funds? All of that is true."With coronavirus cases multiplying worldwide, Gates said there would be one simple way to judge the global vaccine initiative: "When did we stop the pandemic? That\'s the thing this all needs to be measured by."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

"I\'ve served in six administrations, so I\'ve seen a number of transitions, and I know that transitions are very important to get a smooth … I use the metaphor, essentially passing a baton without stopping running.

Read on to hear his further warnings, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.Dr. Fauci Warned the "Virus is Just Going to Keep Going"Fauci has been a member of the White House coronavirus task force since the beginning of the pandemic and has become famous for his candid, science-based assessments of what Americans should do to stop its spread. He has warned that this could be a "dark winter" as cases of the virus accelerate.\xa0"The virus is not going to stop and call a time out while things change," said Fauci on Monday. "The virus is just going to keep going."Fauci said that vaccine development "is now going in the very, very strong right direction." In the past week, two potential vaccines produced by the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna have been reported to be more than 90% effective.\xa0"The vaccines are effective," he added. "We want to get it approved as quickly as we possibly can. We want to get doses to people starting in December, and then we want to really get the ball rolling. As we get into January, February, and March, we want a smooth process with that. And the way you do that is by essentially having the two groups speak to each other and exchange information."RELATED: Unhealthiest Habits on the Planet, According to Doctors"We Don\'t Have to Accept Major Surges," Says FauciIn the meantime, the U.S. has set daily records for new coronavirus cases, and health officials worry that hospitals may become overrun by patients who need treatment. Fauci said it\'s important to continue with public health recommendations during this time."It\'s a very serious situation," said Fauci. "We know that this COVID fatigue, that people are just tired of the kinds of restrictions, but there are fundamental things that we talk about all the time — the physical distancing, the washing of hands, the universal wearing of masks, the staying away from crowds throughout the country. We don\'t have to accept major surges. We can blunt them."\xa0About the vaccine, Fauci said, "Help is on the way. It certainly is. But the fact that help is on the way should spur us even more to double down on some of the public health measures, to be able to use the combination of a vaccine and public health measures to turn this thing around."As for yourself, do everything you can to prevent getting—and spreading—COVID-19 in the first place: Wear a face mask, get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don\'t miss these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '4d23f0d7da1779fa607def5593b70fd1', 'title': 'France’s COVID Vaccine Rollout Is Going So Slowly It’ll Take 3,000 Years', 'description': 'PARIS–More than a week after France’s COVID-19 vaccine campaign was launched, only a few thousand people in the entire country have received their first injection, with President Emmanuel Macron’s vaccination strategy widely criticized for being flawed, too slow, and pandering to anti-vaxxers.Only 516 people in France had received their first vaccine dose as of Jan. 1, according to the independent website Covid Tracker, compared with 114,000 in Italy, 238,000 in Germany and more than one million people in the U.K. That figure is now reportedly “over 5,000”, but the Ministry of Health has yet to confirm the exact number. If the French vaccine rollout’s objective of one million vaccinations by the end of January is to be reached, 36,000 jabs must be carried out each day.In interviews with The Daily Beast, French doctors have blasted the country’s approach to the vaccine rollout, singling out “misjudged” policy decisions, a lack of information communicated to health workers, and a lack of preparation.The French strategy initially was to prioritize vulnerable groups in retirement homes, allowing for a two-week process to carry out each vaccination, including a doctor’s consultation, the patient’s approval and the injection itself. However, a slow take-up and reports of large numbers of care home patients refusing the vaccine have forced a change of plan.As of Monday, that recommended time period for vaccination has been reduced to one week and the focus has shifted, with doctors, nurses and carers over the age of 50 now able to volunteer to have a vaccination immediately. City vaccination centers are expected to open before the beginning of February.Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, criticized the decision to begin vaccination in retirement homes. “It was too complicated, it shouldn\'t have begun there,” he said. “If anything the [slow pace of the] strategy has encouraged anti-vaxxers. Medically and scientifically, there is no reason for this to be done slowly. On the contrary, it should be done as quickly as possible.”Inside the World’s COVID Anti-Vaxxer Epicenter“At this pace it would take 3,000 years to reach herd immunity,” said Professor Bruno Megarbane, head of the medical and toxicological intensive care unit at Lariboisière Hospital in Paris. “But for the official authorities, there hasn\'t been a delay in the vaccine rollout. For them, this rollout corresponds to the official vaccination strategy—even if observers like me say there has been a delay. Especially when vaccine doses are now uselessly sitting in freezers, not being used.”Megarbane is “confident” that the speed of vaccinations will increase, but is concerned about the lack of information being shared with hospitals. “We don\'t have any information,” he added. “We don\'t know when vaccination will begin, who can get vaccinated, or who will be allowed to carry out vaccinations.”Some are concerned about the longer-term implications of France’s sluggish start. Dr. Arnaud Fontanet, epidemiologist and member of the Scientific Council, estimates that 12 percent of French people have caught COVID-19 to date but that “the virus will only stop circulating epidemically” when at least half of the population have been immunized.“My worry is not so much about the first few weeks,” he added. “My concern is that we are facing a worldwide demand for these vaccines. In three months, will we have sufficient doses for Europe and the rest of the world.”On Monday the French government will launch a citizens’ committee formed of 35 randomly-selected, non-expert French people to help decide the country’s vaccine strategy. Made up of representatives of different demographics such as age, gender, region, level of qualification and socio-professional category, the committee is intended to "nourish the executive and legislative power" of the vaccination campaign and “to take into account their responses” .In the middle of an unprecedented health crisis, however, the creation of a non-expert group to advise on policy has led to puzzlement.“The French are vaccine sceptics despite our great elders like Pasteur,” said Emmanuel Andrès, head of the internal medicine department of Strasbourg’s University Hospitals and president of the medical commission establishment. “Personally, I don\'t really see how a citizens\' committee could be useful in defining French vaccination policy.”Mixed messages from the government over the plans haven’t helped matters. On Sunday the minister of transport, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, told BFM-TV that the goal was to “vaccinate 26 million people by the summer”, contradicting the target of 15 million set out by Prime Minister Jean Castex before parliament in December. Gabriel Attal, the government spokesperson, was then forced to clarify that the “priority objective” is 15 million by the summer.In comments leaked to the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, Macron complained that the government’s vax program has all the urgency of a “family stroll” and that “the government has failed to grasp the seriousness of the moment”. The report cited a senior minister source claiming that health authorities incapable of organizing mass vaccination were “presenting a constraint as a strategy”.Macron has also come under withering criticism in the national media for this latest misstep. “While America, Israel, Great Britain, Germany gallop, France advances at the speed of the snail. Champion in restrictions, gold medal in certificates, she is last in solutions,” read an editorial in Le Figaro, a daily newspaper.The French government has received 560,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine and from Wednesday, it expects to receive another 500,000. But the first two deliveries of vaccines at the end of December 2020—first 60,000, then 500,000 doses—were only sent to 40 hospitals, out of the hundred reference centers selected by the state.On top of the slow vaccine rollout, Macron is under pressure for failures in public education that put anti-vaxxer sentiment at nearly 60 percent and the fact that the French Sanofi vaccine will be delayed until the end of 2021 while Germany’s Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine and the U.K.’s Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have already been deployed.An Odoxa poll for Le Figaro, which was published on Sunday but carried out on Dec. 22 and 23, found that the majority of the population is still reluctant to be vaccinated, with a refusal rate of 58 per cent. That\'s an increase of 8 points compared to the previous month, when the first vaccines were given the green light.But in France, the arrival of the British variant of SARS-CoV-2, suspected of being more contagious, has raised concerns. The director general of health, Jérôme Salomon, said that “the trend is already worrying.” Even though the impact of the festive period is not yet known, he said: “We have had a gradual increase since the beginning of December”.Currently, 24,780 patients are hospitalized in France because of COVID-19, including 2,665 in intensive care, according to data from Public Health France. A total of 65,037 people have died since the beginning of the pandemic.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'ba94960b15369a8a805b6d1c2675e314', 'title': 'Biden is apparently determined to focus on infrastructure this week', 'description': 'One leitmotif of former President Donald Trump\'s tenure was his administration announcing "infrastructure week" at the White House — only to have Trump, or circumstances beyond the president\'s control, intervene and demolish any such plans. President Biden, however, appears determined to make "infrastructure week" something other than a punch line. And this week, a sort of infrastructure week, should test his resolve. "Biden is putting his foot on the gas pedal and moving ahead with his plans to sell an expansive infrastructure proposal this week," even as he "faces mounting pressure to act on other legislative priorities that have become increasingly difficult to ignore," USA Today reports. He will lay out the contours of his infrastructure plan, expected to cost up to $3 trillion, at an event in Pittsburgh on Wednesday. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Fox News Sunday that Biden has decided to break his "Build Back Better" plan into two legislative proposals, the first of which will deal with broadly popular items like rebuilding roads and bridges, shoring up railroads, and expanding broadband to rural communities — projects Republicans have supported in the past. "I will say that I don\'t think Republicans in this country think we should be 13th in the world as it relates to infrastructure," Psaki said, referring to a World Economic Forum ranking. "Roads, railways, rebuilding them — that\'s not a partisan issue." Biden will release the second proposal, focused on the "caregiver economy" — expanding access to child care and health care, for example — in April, she added. Biden is probably wise to take "a kind of hard-nosed assessment about what\'s politically possible and moving forward on those items," William Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, tells USA Today. "The politics of infrastructure aren\'t like the politics of gun violence. It\'s about decaying roads and bridges that are not quite as safe as they once were. If you say we\'ve got to always respond to the latest crisis, most of the time, you\'re going to put infrastructure on the back burner."

{'_id': '40fe633aedbfab2f76d71f1862dd1bc0', 'title': 'Here Comes the Biden Blame Game', 'description': 'During the eight years that President Obama and his team managed the economy, Americans were regularly assured that the president’s Keynesian policies would deliver striking growth in the years ahead. The growth repeatedly failed to materialize, and what followed was a master class in blamesmanship. No matter how far into the Obama term we were, the disappointing growth was a “new normal”- not the result of President Obama’s high tax and heavy regulatory policies. It was all the fault of the Bush administration. In some sense, Bush was portrayed for the entire eight years as a comic book villain. His policies were so terrible that they were able to overwhelm the economy for years.Watching Vice President Biden prepare to be president gives one a strong feeling of déjà vu. Last week he called on Congress to pass Nancy Pelosi’s large and untargeted stimulus bill, chock-full of candy that is poison to Senate Republicans, such as a massive bailout for blue states. He added that it is going to be a “long dark winter” with the emphasis on long, and promised to return to his “Build Back Better” agenda of tax hikes and regulatory crackdowns as soon as possible.Before they storm the castle, perhaps the Biden team should make a list of their assets. The first asset is a strong economy. The COVID-19 pandemic recession likely ended in the third quarter of this year, when real GDP advanced a whopping 33.1 percent. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate for the fourth quarter suggests it will post growth around six percentage points. Combining the two, that means that the economy will about return to the level of GDP it posted right before the pandemic began, back when we had the strongest economy in generations. So the “back” part of the Biden slogan is superfluous, as the economy will likely be back before he takes office. As has been discussed at length in this space, that agenda doesn’t build at all, but rather subtracts from economic activity. So it doesn’t build, we are already back, and it’s worse than the status quo.The second asset is a vaccine. We are very close to the widespread availability of two enormously successful vaccines. More could well be on the way. Most Americans should be able to receive them by the spring. This means that the acceleration in the economy that is currently underway should, if we leave it alone, pick up steam as things head back to a post-pandemic normal.The third asset is a likely Republican-controlled Senate that has already shown that it is able to pass significant stimulus legislation. But it is not going to hand out cash to blue state willy nilly as the House Democrats have proposed.Which completes the setting. The economy is carrying enormous positive momentum into next year. Since the case load is spiking now, there is some chance that lockdowns will get worse before they get better. Firms around the country need to tread water for a few more months, after which they can return to normal. The risk is that there is a wave of bankruptcies between now and the late spring, that is set off by a return to widespread shutdowns. To face this risk, the administration needs to show it is serious about finding a compromise stimulus package, and cognizant that a promise of massive tax hikes next year is a negative for business sentiment. Businesses that are just hanging on with hope of a brighter future could well give up if that future includes a government that taxes away all their profits.Unfortunately, Vice President Biden has come out with exactly the opposite of this message. By sticking to the Pelosi bill, he fails to signal a willingness to compromise, suggesting to those holding out for another round of stimulus that they have little to hope for. And the future is dark as well, since the administration’s tax hikes are coming. In other words, he seems poised to fritter away all of the economic gains that the U.S. has achieved in the second half of this year. If the double-dip recession hits next year, Biden will remind us over and over that its Donald Trump’s fault. My guess is that he will find a way to mention Bush as well.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': 'febfd63add3211f8a11590b83c4a31c4', 'title': "2,596 Trades in One Term: Inside Sen. David Perdue's Stock Portfolio", 'description': 'As a member of the Senate\'s cybersecurity subcommittee, David Perdue has raised alarms that hackers from overseas pose a threat to U.S. computer networks. Citing a frightening report by a California-based company called FireEye, Perdue was among the senators who asked this spring that the National Guard prepare to protect against such data breaches.Not only was the issue important to Perdue, so was FireEye, a federal contractor that provides malware detection and threat-intelligence services. Beginning in 2016, the senator bought and sold FireEye stock 61 times, at one point owning as much as $250,000 worth of shares in the company.Along with Sen. Kelly Loeffler, also R-Ga., Perdue faces an unusual runoff election in January. With control of the Senate at stake, and amid renewed concern about the potential for conflicts of interest in stock trading by members of Congress, Perdue\'s investment activity -- and especially his numerous well-timed trades -- has increasingly come into the public glare.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesLast week, The New York Times reported that the Justice Department had investigated the senator for possible insider trading in his sale of more than $1 million worth of stock in a financial analysis firm, Cardlytics. Ultimately, prosecutors declined to bring charges. Other media outlets have revealed several trades in companies whose business dealings fall under the jurisdiction of Perdue\'s committees.An examination of Perdue\'s stock trading during his six years in office reveals that he has been the Senate\'s most prolific stock trader by far, sometimes reporting 20 or more transactions in a single day.The Times analyzed data compiled by Senate Stock Watcher, a nonpartisan website that aggregates publicly available information on lawmakers\' trading, and found that Perdue\'s transactions accounted for nearly a third of all senators\' trades reported in the past six years. His 2,596 trades, mostly in stocks but also in bonds and funds, roughly equal the combined trading volume of the next five most active traders in the Senate.The data also shows the breadth of trades Perdue made in companies that stood to benefit from policy and spending matters that came not just before the Senate as a whole, but before the committees and subcommittees on which he served.Nearly half of Perdue\'s FireEye trades, for example, occurred while he sat on the cybersecurity panel -- a role that potentially could have provided him with nonpublic information about companies like FireEye. During that period, FireEye landed a subcontract worth more than $30 million with the Army Cyber Command, which had operations at Fort Gordon, in Perdue\'s home state. In 2018, Perdue reported capital gains of up to $15,000 from FireEye trades.And as a member of the Senate banking, housing, and urban affairs committee since 2017, Perdue bought and sold shares of a number of financial companies his panel oversaw, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Regions Financial.Perdue disputes the notion that his investment activity posed a conflict, saying that his trades were handled by outside advisers without his input, although his instructions to Goldman Sachs to sell Cardlytics suggest that he directed at least some trades."Sen. Perdue doesn\'t handle the day-to-day decisions of his portfolio -- all of his holdings are managed by outside financial advisers who make recommendations, set strategy and manage trades and personal finances," said John Burke, communications director for the senator\'s reelection campaign.Robert Hutchinson, Perdue\'s wealth manager at Goldman Sachs, declined to comment.In April, after questions were raised about stock trades that Perdue and other senators had made around the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, he abruptly sold virtually all of his stock holdings -- between $3.2 million and $9.4 million worth. (Members of Congress report their transactions in ranges, so it is often impossible to pinpoint the exact dollar values.) In May, he announced that his advisers would no longer trade in individual stocks for his portfolio, with the exception of a few companies on whose boards he had previously served, including Cardlytics; the utility Alliant Energy; and Graphic Packaging, a paper-based-packaging provider.Although Perdue has been unusually active in stock trading, his robust investing activity highlights broader questions once again being debated more than eight years after the passage of the STOCK Act, a law meant to grapple with the ethical issues inherent in lawmakers\' buying and selling stocks.While there is no law or regulation prohibiting such trading, the practice has long invited questions about possible conflicts -- and the potential for insider trading -- that can arise when members of powerful congressional committees buy and sell shares of companies directly affected by the issues before them. (By comparison, avoiding some or all individual stocks is common practice in other branches of government, where federal law prohibits most employees from engaging in matters whose outcomes may have financial implications for them.)"Members are in a constant state of gathering information from briefings, hearings, constituent meetings, investigations and staff," said Aaron Cooper, special counsel to the law firm Jenner & Block who previously served as lead minority investigative counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee. "They receive a massive amount of data every day -- both public and nonpublic -- and it\'s not always clear which category the information belongs to."As a result, he said, "prosecutors often face an uphill battle" in making an insider trading case against a member of Congress.The trend on Capitol Hill was already moving away from individual stock holding when Perdue was elected in 2014. Many senators had reduced their trading in individual stocks after the 2012 STOCK Act, which prohibited members of Congress from trading on nonpublic information acquired in the course of their duties. An analysis by Public Citizen published in 2017 credited the legislation with a 50% decline in stock trading by senators.Perdue\'s Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, has seized on the trading as a campaign issue. In a news conference Monday, he accused Perdue of "using his office to enrich himself" through the stock trades. A spokesperson for Perdue called the critique a "discredited line of attack" that was "baseless," and his campaign recently unveiled an ad arguing that he was "totally exonerated" by federal overseers who had studied his trades.Yet others have also found fault with Perdue\'s trading.In a letter last week to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., requested an investigation of Perdue\'s trades in BWX Technologies, a Virginia-based company that supplies nuclear components for Navy submarines. The trades were first reported by The Daily Beast.Perdue began buying the company\'s stock about a month before he took over as chair of the Senate\'s seapower subcommittee, where he pushed to beef up the nation\'s defenses, including by adding a multibillion-dollar nuclear submarine of the type BWX Technologies provides components for.He reported earning between $15,000 and $50,000 in capital gains when he sold the stock.Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who believes that the STOCK Act does not go far enough, has co-sponsored legislation that would ban the trading of individual stocks by members of Congress."There is no way that the public can\'t sense, can\'t absolutely smell, that this is corrupt, that you have it in the back of your mind when you vote," said Merkley. "You may have the public interest in your mind, but you also have in your mind how that decision might impact the value of your portfolio."A History of Good TimingPerdue, whose estimated net worth is more than $15 million, arrived on Capitol Hill in 2015, billing himself as an outsider and emphasizing his experience as a top executive at companies like Dollar General, Reebok and Haggar Clothing. He immediately established himself as a skeptic of government regulation, at various points suggesting the abolishment of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.As his term progressed, Perdue -- or his advisers -- would place some prescient bets in his portfolio, buying and selling stocks at just the right moment. His trading in Devon Energy, a company co-founded in 1971 by J. Larry Nichols, a major Republican donor, provides an example.On Nov. 12, 2015, Perdue sold his position in Devon, worth between $50,000 and $100,000, on a day the stock\'s price closed at $45.06. Over the next month, Devon\'s price would fall as low as $31.54, a 30% drop from the date Perdue liquidated his holdings. Analysts attributed the stock\'s decline to the company\'s announcement, after Perdue\'s sale, that it would acquire assets from Felix Energy.Although Perdue has traded many energy stocks while in office, buying and selling dozens of drilling, pipeline, power and related equipment companies, the transactions that invite special scrutiny are those involving industries that were within his direct oversight through his committee positions.Perdue actively traded in First Data, a financial firm based in Atlanta. Like his trading in Devon Energy, Perdue\'s transactions in First Data appear to have been well timed, as reported by The Daily Beast.After selling his entire stake in First Data in November 2018, Perdue repurchased shares in the company that December, three weeks before it announced a merger with financial services technology firm Fiserv on Jan. 16, 2019. Perdue subsequently reported capital gains of $50,000 to $100,000 in First Data.Perdue had received campaign contributions from First Data executives.During his Senate term, Perdue has at various times held shares in roughly a dozen banks, ranging in size from JPMorgan Chase, the nation\'s largest bank with nearly $2.7 trillion in assets, to the comparatively tiny First Hawaiian Bank.Regions Financial, a regional lender based in Birmingham, Alabama, has been one of Perdue\'s frequent trades. He spent much of his term loading up on the stock, buying shares on 30 occasions.Perdue was particularly active in buying Regions in 2017 and early 2018. During that time, he was also pushing to roll back financial regulations that had imposed additional scrutiny and cash constraints on banks with more than $50 billion in assets after the financial crisis. On Sept. 28, 2017, he co-sponsored a Senate bill proposing to soften the regulations governing midsize banks like Regions. A broader bill, which included the same proposal, was approved by the Senate the following March and signed into law by President Donald Trump that May.Between May 2017, about four months before Perdue introduced his legislation, and that November, he made more than a dozen purchases of Regions shares. And between Perdue\'s first purchase of Regions stock in 2017 and the time Trump signed the bill in 2018, the bank\'s shares rallied 35%.The chief executive of Regions, John M. Turner Jr., has also contributed to Perdue\'s reelection campaign.Stocks Poised to Surge in a PandemicPerdue\'s decision to sell off his stock holdings this past April followed criticism of trades made by several senators in coronavirus-sensitive stocks just after they had attended a Senate briefing Jan. 24.In the aftermath of those sales, the Justice Department opened investigations into trading by Sens. Loeffler; Richard M. Burr, R-N.C.; James M. Inhofe, R-Okla.; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. All have since been closed except the Burr inquiry, which is also nearing an end, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.Perdue, whose office has said he did not attend that briefing, was among those who bought and sold some of those stocks, including Pfizer, in the weeks that followed.Perdue purchased up to $260,000 worth of Pfizer stock between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28, in the early days of a market downturn. On the 28th, he issued a news release reporting that he had regularly attended briefings led by the coronavirus task force; records subsequently showed that he had bought the third tranche of Pfizer shares that same day.The news release also emphasized that the U.S. government was expediting the development of a coronavirus vaccine. And in March, Pfizer announced its partnership with a German biotechnology company, BioNTech, to develop a coronavirus vaccine.Perdue had frequently traded Pfizer stock before this year. He had rarely traded another stock he bought in the early stages of the U.S. outbreak, DuPont, which, as a manufacturer of personal protective equipment, also stood to benefit from the coronavirus response. (Perdue purchased some shares in DuPont on Jan. 24, the day of the Senate briefing, and additional shares later.)In late February and early March, Perdue sold stock in Caesars, an entertainment company whose casino business would be hard-hit by the pandemic, but purchased shares of Disney and Delta, additions to his portfolio that seem to run counter to any suggestion that he was trading on insider information about the virus.Midway through April, Perdue began selling most of his stocks. He moved some of his money into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which track baskets of stocks or bonds.The shift appeared timed to counteract harsh criticism leveled by the senator\'s political opponents.

Moderna says its experimental shot is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19.               That&#39;s based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial.               It makes it the second U.S. company to report results that far exceed expectations.               Together with the Pfizer vaccine, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the U.S. could have two vaccines authorised for emergency use by December.               A key advantage of Moderna&#39;s vaccine is that it does not need ultra-cold storage like Pfizer&#39;s, making it easier to distribute.               Production of the Moderna shots will partially be carried out by Swiss biotechnology firm Lonza at plants in the U.S. and Switzerland.               The news sent Moderna shares up around 17 percent.               Also on Monday, Russia said it expects to produce primarily freeze-dried Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine doses by the spring.               That would eliminate the need for transport at ultra-low temperatures.               Russia has an ambitious plan to inoculate its population.               But vaccine developers globally are scrambling to work out how to ship and store their vials, some of which must be kept in specialised freezers at extremely low temperatures.               The logistical challenge was brought into sharp focus after promising interim trial data for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer.               It&#39;s been considered a major breakthrough in the race to curb the pandemic.               But it needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, equivalent to an Antarctic winter.               That poses a challenge for even the most sophisticated hospitals.

Raphael Warnock demanded Saturday, along with a clip of his opponent dissembling in their recent debate."Happy Sunday," his fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff greeted supporters, "Why hasn\'t David Perdue put his stocks in a blind trust yet?"The double runoff in Georgia to determine control of the United States Senate is a rare election where a significant change in campaign message can be truly tested in the same cycle. Did the Biden campaign, and the Democratic Party as whole, make a mistake by not focusing aggressively on Donald Trump and other top Republicans? Were the party\'s failure to capture the Senate and disappointing House results simply products of running the wrong campaign?What voters did hear from the Biden campaign this year was primarily about health care, national unity, and COVID-19. The Democratic candidate\'s pitch was a mostly positive message of restoring dignity to the office, protecting the Affordable Care Act, and competently handling the pandemic. What was mostly absent was talk of Trump\'s corruption. For example, in the final week before the election, Biden tweeted about health care and defending the Affordable Care Act 10 times, the COVID-19 pandemic 15 times, but only once about Trump\'s corruption. Biden\'s so-called "closing argument" television ads reflected similar themes, and this was a pattern throughout the entire campaign.These messages didn\'t seem to resonate strongly in swing states, though. Both Fox News and CNN exit polls found Trump with a slight edge in those states on the question of who would better handle COVID-19, and the Fox poll found slightly more support for repealing at least part of the Affordable Care Act than there was for keeping it.Meanwhile, Democrats went easy on the Trump administration throughout his time in office. House Democrats could have gotten Trump\'s tax returns from New York state before the election but didn\'t push for them because they worried it would appear too partisan. Numerous scandals by Trump cabinet officials didn\'t receive full hearings or threats of impeachment. Even when House Democrats did impeach President Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided to go for a "narrow" impeachment focused only on the election interference issue. Then that impeachment was barely mentioned by Biden or any other Democrats during the campaign.By comparison, when House Republicans knew they would likely face Hillary Clinton in 2016, over the course of more than two years they spent $7 million holding 33 hearings to produce an 800-page report on just the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi. It was a relentless effort that, despite its thin factual premise, laid the groundwork for much of the prolonged controversy over Clinton\'s use of a private email server which undoubtedly drove down Clinton\'s favorable numbers and eventually her turnout.While some might argue that 2016 Trump voters didn\'t seem to care about his self-dealings, Democrats didn\'t need to convert those 2016 voters, they just needed to stop Trump from growing his base. A four-year long focus on doggedly pursuing Trump\'s many scandals and flagrant corruption would have made it harder for Trump to win over new supporters, and could have convinced infrequent, Republican-leaning voters that they might as well stay home. If Trump had only gotten the same number of votes he did in 2016, Biden would have easily won Florida, Texas, and North Carolina. Instead, Trump\'s approval rating barely moved during his presidency, and he increased his popular vote total by 11 million. That increased Republican turnout was also the primary difference between the Democratic wave in the 2018 midterms and the Democrats\' anemic House and Senate results this year.This is what makes the Georgia runoff elections a perfect test case. Now, Democrats are running the corruption-focused campaign they didn\'t run against Trump, heavily highlighting Republican senators\' well-timed stock trades after receiving nonpublic information. Over one week in early December, Ossoff tweeted 14 times about Republican Sen. David Perdue\'s "corruption" and questionable stock trades. Similarly, 10 of Warnock\'s tweets were about Loeffler "personally profiting off the pandemic" after getting a secret briefing on COVID-19. This message is also featured heavily in the ads currently saturating the state.Democrats entered these runoffs behind. In the November election, Perdue led Ossoff 49.73 percent to 47.95 percent. And while Warnock technically led Loeffler 32.9 percent to 25.91 percent, that special election was effectively an open primary, with all the Republican candidates collectively winning 50.5 percent of the two-party vote to Democrats\' 49.5 percent. The Democratic party needs to make up significant ground, and a corruption argument could be what does it.According to Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, his message testing in 2016 and 2018 showed a strong positive response to calling out corrupt political deals. If Democrats manage to pull off a double win in Georgia, it would be more strong evidence that a campaign that attacks incumbents\' perceived corruption can move voters, or at least convince the incumbents\' potential supporters to stay home. It would imply the Democrats missed a golden opportunity to make even larger gains this November by not putting Trump\'s misdeeds at the very center of their message.More stories from theweek.com  Joe Biden still doesn\'t get it  Fauci: Americans without underlying conditions could get COVID-19 vaccine by late March, early April  Donald Trump\'s defeat is good.

{'_id': '75aea7ea752d56011e32140b67bbbaf0', 'title': 'President Biden Is Keeping Schools Closed', 'description': 'Six months ago, when President Joe Biden was candidate Joe Biden, he spoke of “a crisis being felt all across the United States of America.” The crisis was school closures. Millions of children were staring at laptops rather than learning in a classroom. Biden said: “This is a national emergency. President Trump doesn’t have a real plan for opening schools safely. He’s offering nothing but failures and delusions.” Six months later, the education crisis abounds, and now-President Biden is so far just making it worse. At Tuesday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the new White House goal was “to have the majority of schools, so more than 50 percent, open by Day 100 of his presidency.” She defined that as “some teaching in classrooms, so at least one day a week, hopefully it’s more.” This isn’t just walking back a promise; it’s completely erasing one. According to school-data aggregator Burbio, we are already well past Psaki’s spring milestone today, and we were before Biden took office. Over 60 percent of school districts are already open with at least a “hybrid” model. “Hybrid” colloquially means two to three days a week of in-person learning. One day a week was not originally part of this debate. It’s a new and lower standard — one Team Biden has introduced. At first, I thought the transgression was simply they had put the issue on the backburner and were not paying attention to it, given the strange one-day-a-week utterance. But after 24 hours of blowback, Psaki was asked to clarify these remarks and she doubled down, calling the plan “bold and ambitious.” And sticking to the one-day standard, she said they hoped to exceed it. Again, this supposed bold and ambitious plan was exceeded before the inauguration. Politico Playbook said: “It is a goal so modest and lacking in ambition as to be almost meaningless.” President Biden’s ambitious rhetoric around schools was always going to have a collision course with his teachers’-union benefactors, who simply do not want schools to fully reopen any time soon. Not even after teachers got priority in vaccinations, and K–12 schools received over $68 billion in 2020 to mitigate COVID issues. I just didn’t expect that he would be breaking a core campaign promise so early in his presidency. So what’s holding Biden back from keeping his word? The White House would argue it’s funding, ventilation, and class sizes. Let’s look at each in turn. As mentioned, Congress allocated over $68 billion in 2020 for COVID mitigation in K–12 schools. So far, most of this money has not been spent. That hasn’t stopped the Biden administration from demanding another $130 billion. But let’s ignore the currently unspent billions of dollars for a moment and ask the essential question: Will more funding help? In fact, the schools that are currently open five days a week in America are parochial schools, which generally have less per-pupil funding than their public counterparts, and public schools that don’t compete with the per-pupil wealth of closed but well-funded districts such as Chicago, Fairfax County, San Francisco, and others. The issue is will, not resources. Ventilation is simply a crutch to excuse doing nothing. It was a problem identified early in 2020, again to mitigate the return to school before a coronavirus vaccine was available. The $68 billion Congress authorized provided funding specifically for ventilation. But most schools did little or nothing in the past year to improve ventilation, and it is more likely that we finally return to school before any substantive changes are made to the thousands of schools that remain shuttered. The absence of new ventilation systems has not held back the majority of schools that have opened up to some degree without disruption. Meanwhile, focusing the debate on the importance of class size is a way to disguise proposing that kids will go to school two days a week indefinitely. The idea is that a full class increases risk, so we need to cut class sizes in half. But nobody realistically believes that America is about to double its school-building capacity, at least not in the next year. Anyone whose kid has gone to class in a trailer behind a school building knows that it takes years to develop plans for new buildings, personnel, and district lines. The two-day-a-week hybrid model, with its implicitly smaller class sizes, was created to get kids back into the classroom before a vaccine was available. Inept school boards kept delaying the end of this temporary measure. Now, after it has been done for so long, it is being deceptively embraced as the post-vaccine ideal. This is simply nuts. After teachers in closed school districts are vaccinated, schools should be open full-time, five-days-a-week, just as so many of their counterparts already are doing (and as some were doing before vaccines were even available). Now that teachers are being vaccinated, for whom are we making these vast infrastructure changes anyway? It’s not for the teachers, whose risk will thankfully soon be measured in decimal points. And it’s not for children, who — public-health officials often and repeatedly remind us — are not significant spreaders or victims of this virus. In fact, the major health crises facing children today — depression, suicide, lack of confidence, academic failures, lack of socialization, poor nutrition, insufficient exercise — are being caused by the closures, not by the virus. In September 2020, Joe Biden said: “President Trump may not think this is a national emergency, but I think going back to school for millions of children and the impacts on their families and the community is a national emergency. I believe that’s what it is.” If this was a national emergency six months ago, and remains one today, where’s Joe? Some would argue that he should have more time, and that patience is required. He’s only been in office a few weeks. But we shouldn’t be surprised that many parents are simply out of patience. Others argue that advocating for school openings is anti-teacher. It’s a convenient way to shut down debate, because teachers are often underpaid and undervalued and thus not open to critique. But I love my kids’ teachers, who are doing the best they can. This is about being pro-children, not anti-teacher. In September, President Biden said: “Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos haven’t stepped up. We’re all seeing the results. Millions of students are now starting the new school year in the same way they finished the last one, at home. At home. Parents are doing their best, but more and more they’re finding themselves at wit’s end struggling to balance work and childcare and educational duties or worrying about their lost paycheck and how they’ll make ends meet while trying to keep their kids on track with remote learning.” Under Biden’s current plan, he has failed to live up to the standard he set for Trump. It’s time for Biden to purposefully engage this issue. He has enormous influence over unions and those who are advocating for kids to remain locked out of in-person instruction indefinitely. He has a serious group of public-health advisers who can persuade nervous parents and teachers of the low risks they face returning to the classroom (especially after a vaccine). As Joe Biden said six months ago on this subject: “Mr. President, where are you? Where are you? Why aren’t you working on this? Mr. President, that’s your job. That’s what you should be focused on right now. Getting our kids back to school safely.”', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': '01b01b6f44880c660526ddf2b9a2afdd', 'title': "Biden Tells Allies 'America Is Back,' but Macron and Merkel Push Back", 'description': 'President Joe Biden used his first public encounter with America’s European allies to describe a new struggle between the West and the forces of autocracy, declaring that “America is back” while acknowledging that the past four years had taken a toll on its power and influence. His message stressing the importance of reinvigorating alliances and recommitting to defending Europe was predictably well received at a session of the Munich Security Conference that Biden addressed from the White House. But there was also pushback, notably from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who in his address made an impassioned defense of his concept of “strategic autonomy” from the United States, making the case that Europe can no longer be overly dependent on the United States as it focuses more of its attention on Asia, especially China. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times And even Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is leaving office within the year, tempered her praise for Biden’s decision to cancel plans for a withdrawal of 12,000 U.S. troops from the country with a warning that “our interests will not always converge.” It appeared to be a reference to Germany’s ambivalence about confronting China — a major market for its automobiles and other high-end German products — and to the continuing battle with the United States over the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Russia. But all three leaders seemed to recognize that their first virtual encounter was a moment to celebrate the end of the era of “America First,” and for Macron and Merkel to welcome back Biden, a politician whom they knew well from his years as a senator and vice president. And Biden used the moment to warn about the need for a common strategy in pushing back at an Internet-fueled narrative, promoted by both Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China, that the chaos surrounding the American election was another sign of democratic weakness and decline. “We must demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people in this changed world,” Biden said, adding, “We have to prove that our model isn’t a relic of history.” For the president, a regular visitor to the conference even as a private citizen after serving as vice president, the address was something of a homecoming. The session was crunched down to a video meeting by Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, this year’s host, and the European leaders decided to do the same for a brief, closed meeting of the Group of 7 allies that Biden also participated in. The next in-person summit meeting is still planned for Britain this summer, pandemic permitting. Biden never named his predecessor, Donald Trump, in his remarks, but framed them around wiping out the traces of Trumpism in the United States’ approach to the world. He celebrated its return to the Paris climate agreement, which took effect just before the meeting, and a new initiative, announced Thursday night, to join Britain, France and Germany in engaging Iran diplomatically in an effort to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement that Trump exited. But rather than detail an agenda, Biden tried to recall the first principles that led to the Atlantic alliance and the creation of NATO in 1949, near the beginning of the Cold War. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident,” the president said. “We have to defend it. Strengthen it. Renew it.” In a deliberate contrast to Trump, who talked about withdrawing from NATO and famously declined on several occasions to acknowledge the United States’ responsibilities under Article V of the alliance’s charter to come to the aid of members under attack, Biden cast the United States as ready to assume its responsibilities as the linchpin of the alliance. “We will keep the faith” with the obligation, he said, adding that “an attack on one is an attack on all.” But he also pressed Europe to think about challenges in a new way — different from the Cold War, even if the two biggest geostrategic adversaries seem familiar. “We must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China,” he said, naming “cyberspace, artificial intelligence and biotechnology” as the new territory for competition. And he argued for pushing back against Russia — he called Putin by his last name, with no title attached — mentioning in particular the need to respond to the SolarWinds attack that was aimed at federal and corporate computer networks. “Addressing Russian recklessness and hacking into computer networks in the United States and across Europe and the world has become critical to protect collective security,” Biden said. The president avoided delving in to the difficult question of how to make Russia pay a price without escalating the confrontation. A senior White House cyberofficial told reporters this week that the scope and depth of the Russian intrusion was still under study, and officials are clearly struggling to come up with options to fulfill Biden’s commitment to make Putin pay a price for the attack. But it was the dynamic with Macron, who has made a habit of criticizing the NATO alliance as nearing “brain death” and no longer “pertinent” since the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, that captured attention. Macron wants NATO to act as more of a political body, a place where European members have equivalent status to the United States and are less subject to the American tendency to dominate decision-making. A Europe better able to defend itself, and more autonomous, would make NATO “even stronger than before,” Macron insisted. He said Europe should be “much more in charge of its own security,” increasing its commitments to spending on defense to “rebalance” the trans-Atlantic relationship. That is not a widely shared view among the many European states that do not want to spend the money required, and the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are unwilling to trust their security to anyone but the United States. Macron also urged that the renovation of NATO’s security abilities should involve “a dialogue with Russia.” NATO has always claimed that it is open to better relations with Moscow, but that Russia is not interested, especially as long as international sanctions remain after its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine about seven years ago. But Macron, speaking in English to answer a question, also argued that Europe could not count on the United States as much as it had in past decades. “We must take more of the burden of our own protection,” he said. In practice, it will take many years for Europe to build up a defense arm that would make it more self-reliant. But Macron is determined to start now, just as he is determined to increase the European Union’s technological capacities so that it can become less dependent on American and Chinese supply chains. Biden, in contrast, wants to deepen those supply chains — of both hardware and software — among like-minded Western allies in an effort to lessen Chinese influence. He is preparing to propose a new joint project for European and American technology companies in areas like semiconductors and the kinds of software that Russia exploited in the SolarWinds hacking. It was Merkel who dwelled on the complexities of dealing with China, given its dual role as competitor and necessary partner for the West. “In recent years, China has gained global clout, and as trans-Atlantic partners and democracies, we must do something to counter this,” Merkel said. “Russia continually entangles European Union members in hybrid conflicts,” she said. “Consequently, it is important that we come up with a trans-Atlantic agenda toward Russia that makes cooperative offers on the one hand, but on the other very clearly names the differences.” While Biden announced he would make good on an American promise to donate $4 billion to the campaign to expedite the manufacturing and distribution of coronavirus vaccines around the world — a move approved last year by a Democratic-led House and a Republican led-Senate — there were clear differences in approach during the meeting. Underscoring the importance that the European Union accords to Africa, Macron called on Western nations to supply 13 million vaccine doses to African governments “as soon as possible” to protect health workers. He warned that if the alliance failed to do this, “our African friends will be pressured by their populations, and rightly so, to buy doses from the Chinese, the Russians or directly from laboratories.” Vaccine donations would reflect “a common will to advance and share the same values,” Macron said. Otherwise, “the power of the West, of Europeans and Americans, will be only a concept, and not a reality.” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, on Friday also urged countries and drugmakers to help speed up the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines across the globe, warning that the world could be “back at Square 1” if some countries went ahead with their vaccination campaigns and left others behind. “Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do, it’s also the smartest to do,” Tedros said to the Munich conference. He argued that the longer it would take to vaccinate populations in every country, the longer the pandemic would remain out of control.

{'_id': '442c565e93753cf2fa34ac3d746c06bb', 'title': 'Brian Kemp Cast His Lot With Trump, and Has Now Paid the Price', 'description': 'ATLANTA -- Few politicians have been both elevated and diminished by the vicissitudes of President Donald Trump like Brian Kemp, Georgia\'s Republican governor.Kemp rocketed from hard-right underdog candidate to the governor\'s mansion two years ago on the strength of a surprise endorsement from Trump, and an argument that the president was right about a lot of issues facing the country.But these days Kemp is facing daily reminders of the perils of deciding that Trump is actually wrong.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIn recent weeks, Kemp has infuriated the president for resisting his demands to help overturn the election results in Georgia, a state Trump lost by roughly 12,000 votes. The president\'s outrage has spread to many of his supporters in Georgia as he persists in his extraordinary intervention into the nation\'s electoral process.At a news conference in the state Capitol on Tuesday to discuss the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine, Kemp was confronted by Trump loyalists asking why he had refused to call a special session of the legislature, as the president has requested, so that lawmakers can reallocate the state\'s 16 electoral votes to Trump. The question crowded the screen of a Facebook live feed of the event. As he departed the event, Kemp was stopped by a small group who presented a bag that they said was filled with 2,000 petitions making the same plea."If he doesn\'t call a special session, he\'s definitely a one-term governor, no doubt about it," said one of the activists, Erik Christensen, CEO of a moving company, who said he voted for Kemp in 2018.Kemp is now the most vivid example of the battle-scarred and even shellshocked conservative Republicans who once basked in Trump\'s glow but now find themselves derided for enforcing their state election rules and laws. Republican governors like Kemp and Doug Ducey of Arizona, and lower-level state officials like Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Georgia, have emerged as a new kind of institutionalist in the face of the Trump attacks on the election system: They are refusing to bend procedures to the will of Trump, and potentially paying a political price for it.As Trump continues to grope for a way to undo his electoral loss to President-elect Joe Biden, he is also engaged in a furious effort to torpedo Kemp\'s political future.Trump has called Kemp "hapless," mocked him for a supposed dip in popularity, and suggested, at a recent rally, that U.S. Rep. Doug Collins should challenge Kemp in the primary when he seeks a second term in 2022."I\'m ashamed that I endorsed him," Trump said in a Fox News interview.The president\'s willingness to threaten the governor\'s fervently pro-Trump voter base demonstrates how challenging it may be for Republicans to navigate a post-presidency in which the mercurial Trump could choose to play kingmaker, de facto party head and potential 2024 candidate.Republican politicians, strategists and party officials are anxiously watching the turmoil in Georgia, fearing that the civil war the president started among Georgia\'s Republicans could spread throughout the country. That would complicate the political dynamics for incumbents like Kemp, who plans to run for reelection two years from now.In November\'s election, Trump expanded the party base, driving up margins in rural areas, winning a larger share of Latino voters and capturing a record number of Republican votes. Whether those new voters will transform into loyal Republicans when Trump is not on the ticket remains one of the biggest uncertainties facing the party. And much may depend on what Trump tells Republicans to do."Any operative is wondering right now whether this is what the future looks like," said Henry Barbour, a Republican committeeman from Mississippi and an influential voice in the party. "We don\'t know, but the party has a tremendous opportunity going forward to build on what the president has accomplished."Kemp, 57, has not been the only target of Trump\'s wrath. Republican politicians and officials across the country who have defended the integrity of the election -- and resisted bending to the will of the president -- have faced a backlash from their own party.In Arizona, Trump has criticized Ducey for certifying Biden\'s win in that state, and suggested he would also pay a political price for it. ("Republicans will long remember!" he wrote in a recent tweet.) While term limits prevent Ducey from seeking another term, he is among those mentioned as a potential presidential contender in 2024.On the day that Ducey was selected to head the Republican Governors Association, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona said in a column on a conservative news site that Ducey had "harmed the common cause of the Republican Party.""The Duceys and the Kemps of the world, they may have some difficulty if they want to seek elective office within the Republican Party," said Michael Burke, chairman of the Republican Party in Pinal County in Arizona. "People will remember what happened here," added Burke, who worked at Trump\'s properties before becoming involved with politics.Allies of the president have begun issuing veiled threats toward Kemp, warning that what they see as his insufficient loyalty to the president could carry a political price."If you\'re not fighting for Trump now when he needs you the most as a Republican leader in Georgia, people are not going to fight for you when you ask them to get reelected," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an appearance on Fox News.Democrats are trying to exploit these divisions. MeidasTouch, a progressive national political committee, announced plans this week to put up billboards in Georgia emblazoned with a Trump tweet that reads, "Why bother voting for Republicans if what you get is Ducey and Kemp?" Biden plans to travel to the state next week to campaign for the two Democratic candidates, who would give his party control of the Senate if they won runoffs against Republican incumbents on Jan. 5.Kemp\'s descent from Trump\'s circle of approval is particularly striking. Throughout his career, he has taken pains to demonstrate his conservative credentials: In one particularly unsubtle ad that ran during his 2018 run for governor, titled "So Conservative," he demonstrated his desire to "blow up government spending" with actual explosives, and "cut regulations" with a real chain saw.It was Trump\'s positive tweet just days before the Republican primary runoff that helped Kemp gain the nomination. Then in the general election, Kemp became one of the Trump era\'s most enduring villains in the eyes of the left after his narrow victory over Stacey Abrams, who was vying to become the nation\'s first Black woman governor.Abrams and her allies argued that Kemp, then the secretary of state, engineered a "stolen" election by supporting policies that Democrats said amounted to voter suppression and in some cases targeted minorities.Since then, much of Kemp\'s political personality had been borrowed directly from Trump. Billing himself as a "politically incorrect conservative," Kemp has echoed Trump\'s hyperbolic message about the violent threats immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally pose to American citizens.Despite his rhetoric, Kemp has not played the role of radical disrupter the way doctrinaire former Republican governors like Sam Brownback of Kansas or Bobby Jindal of Louisiana did. But he has delivered for his conservative base by supporting and signing an anti-abortion "heartbeat" law, which was permanently enjoined by the courts.Other policy actions, including a raise for public schoolteachers, and a slew of appointments reflecting the state\'s burgeoning diversity, suggest some movement on Kemp\'s part toward a practical center. But much of that has been overshadowed by criticism of his reopening of the state in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic and his conflicts with the Democratic mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, including over her efforts to implement a mask mandate.Still, this generally conservative track record has not stemmed the torrent of criticism that is engulfing the governor from the right. Nor have Kemp\'s delicate -- or perhaps awkward -- efforts to praise Trump while steadfastly declining to give him the overturned election results he wants. At the news conference on Tuesday, for instance, Kemp talked about how "grateful" he was for the Trump administration\'s "unprecedented and incredible achievement" of making the vaccine available.A Republican consultant in Georgia familiar with Kemp\'s thinking said that while the governor agrees with many of Trump\'s policies, the president\'s request that he work to overturn the election -- a request Trump made in a phone call with the governor last weekend -- crossed a line.Kemp\'s office declined to make him available for an interview.Kemp\'s relationship with the president began to seriously deteriorate late last year when he defied Trump\'s wishes and appointed Kelly Loeffler, a wealthy Atlanta businesswoman, to an open Senate seat. Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue are the Republican candidates in the Georgia runoffs in January.Kemp will have to run on a ticket in 2022 with whoever wins the Senate seat. By choosing Loeffler, he was most likely trying to craft the image of the state Republican Party in a way that he thought would reflect Georgia\'s evolving politics: a female candidate who he believed could win back more moderate voters in Atlanta\'s populous northern suburbs. He also considered Loeffler, a political novice, a good fit for his brand, which he considers to be pro-business, outside the establishment and conservative.Trump preferred that the Senate seat go to Collins, the conservative Georgia Republican who had passionately defended Trump against impeachment. Collins subsequently jumped into this year\'s race, losing in the first round of voting but pushing Loeffler far to the right to prove her conservative bona fides.A similar dynamic could emerge if Trump backs a primary challenger in the 2022 governor\'s race. That could lead Kemp to lurch rightward after he has made some effort to move to the center. Such a shift might help Abrams, who may challenge Kemp in a rematch.But all of these projections are clouded with questions about the president himself. Will he get involved in 35 local and statewide races, or concentrate on two or three? Will he settle old scores? Kemp\'s political future may depend on the answer."I\'m 100% Donald Trump. I\'m 100% Brian Kemp," said former Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., a Trump ally. "I believe it\'s just something that we\'ve got to get through."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The Trump administration did not track vaccines between federal distribution and administration to patients, Biden officials told Politico. Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/AP The Biden administration has spent its first week in office attempting to manually track down 20m vaccine doses in the pipeline between federal distribution and administration at clinic sites, when a dose finally reaches a patient’s arm. The Trump administration’s strategy pushed the response to the coronavirus pandemic to individual states and omitted pipeline tracking information between distribution and when the shot is actually administered, Biden administration officials told Politico. The lack of data has now forced federal health department officials to spend hours on the phone tracking down vaccine shipments, the news website reported. “Nobody had a complete picture,” Dr Julie Morita, a member of the Biden transition team and executive vice-president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told Politico. “The plans that were being made were being made with the assumption that more information would be available and be revealed once they got into the White House.” As of Saturday, 49 million doses of vaccine have been distributed by the federal government, but only 27 million administered by states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About two million of those doses are believed to be accounted for by a 72-hour lag in reported administration, Politico reported. That still leaves millions in the pipeline between delivery and patient. At least 16 states have used less than half the vaccine doses distributed to them, USA Today reported this week. “Much of our work over the next week is going to make sure that we can tighten up the timelines to understand where in the pipeline the vaccine actually is and when exactly it is administered,” Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, told USA Today. Among the problems in the rollout identified by the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices are the need to improve scheduling, increase staffing and define administration site workflows. States must also improve supply-demand mismatch. In one example, a hospital in Arlington, Virginia, had to cancel 10,000 appointments after the state sent doses to county health departments. The state then directed patients to reschedule appointments through the county health department as they became available. “It’s very disappointing,” Jeff Gorsky, a resident whose 3 February appointment was canceled, told NBC4 Washington. “We’re all stuck in the house, I rarely leave my house now, just to go grocery shopping. It would have freed me up.” Similarly in Wisconsin, lawmakers quizzed the state’s health department on where 180,000 federally distributed vaccines that had yet to be administered were in the pipeline, according to a report from the right-leaning MacIver Institute. A state health department official told lawmakers there was not enough vaccine to meet demand, but also that 50% of the doses had been set aside for a pharmacy partnership to vaccinate staff and residents of long-term care homes. But adding to the confusion, a spokesperson for the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin later said pharmacies had not received the doses from the health department, and still others were set aside for second shots despite federal guidance not to do so. “Some of [the vaccine] was being held back for second doses,” said Danielle Womack, a spokesperson for the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, the MacIver Institute reported. Wisconsin does not expect a vaccination scheduling website to go live until February, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. If the Biden administration can’t get a handle on the rollout, inequities could also exacerbate racial health disparities between the populations worst impacted by Covid-19 and already behind in immunization. An early look at the 17 states and two cities that have released racial breakdowns through 25 January found black people in all places are getting inoculated at levels below their share of the general population, in some cases significantly below. “We’re going to see a widening and exacerbation of the racial health inequities that were here before the pandemic and worsened during the pandemic if our communities cannot access the vaccine,” said Dr Uché Blackstock, a New York emergency physician and CEO of Advancing Health Equity, an advocacy group that addresses bias and inequality. That is true even though they constitute an oversize percentage of the nation’s health care workers, who were put at the front of the line for shots when the campaign began in mid-December. For example, in North Carolina, black people make up 22% of the population and 26% of the health care workforce but only 11% of the vaccine recipients so far. White people, a category in which the state includes both Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites, are 68% of the population and 82% of those vaccinated. The racial immunization gap is partly explained by higher levels of distrust of medical personnel by racial minorities who for centuries have been subject to abusive and discriminatory medical practices. However, it is also a practical matter. In Florida, a plan to distribute Covid-19 vaccines through pharmacies with the supermarket chain Publix – which have been shown to cluster in affluent communities – left residents of Belle Glade 25 miles from the nearest vaccine center. Most residents of the predominantly black community “walk everywhere they go”, said Mayor Steve Wilson. The state later provided a vaccine site for the community. The CDC’s first report on early vaccine rollout is expected in February. The Associated Press contributed to this report', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The vaccine, which was authorized for emergency use last week, is expected to roll out Monday, but CVS and Walgreens, two companies that will distribute the shots at many nursing homes, have said they were told not to administer them in those locations until the week of Dec. 21 (although Human and Health Services Secretary Alex Azar has contradicted that timeline.)The news has created some confusion, but former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb broke the process down for CBS News\' Margaret Brennan on Sunday. As Gottlieb explained, the "critical issue" is that the government hasn\'t gone into the nursing homes to get consent from individual patients in care facilities. That needs to be done before employees from CVS and Walgreens can administer the vaccine.Gottlieb believes the "costly delay" may have been avoidable, despite regulatory orders. "I think they could have" gotten ahead of the FDA\'s emergency use authorization, Gottlieb said, by clearing a "fact sheet" on Pfizer\'s trial data with the FDA ahead of the official hearing, or maybe even provide a limited emergency use authorization just for nursing homes.

U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hanock said enough doses of both vaccines are on order to give the entire population two jabs, and he\'s "highly confident that we can get enough vulnerable people vaccinated by the spring that we can now see our route out of this pandemic."Skeptics may want some caveats attached to that statement since the Oxford-AstraZenca vaccine had some mixed results in clinical trials. Data revealed earlier this month showed it was 62 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections, which is not as high as the roughly 95 percent efficacy rate attributed to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna candidates. But the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot is nevertheless considered safe, and none of the volunteers developed a severe infection or were hospitalized, key metrics in determining the success of a vaccine. It also comes with a few key logistical advantages that could be a game-changer. It\'s cheap to produce, and unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doesn\'t require ultra-cold temperatures for storage, which will make vaccine distribution easier, especially to rural communities. Finally, the gap between the first and second dose of the vaccine can be as long as 12 weeks, which means more people in the U.K. can receive an initial dose at an earlier stage, giving them some form of protection before the second.

Now, a year into the pandemic, the country is setting another wrenching record. No other nation that experienced such a major outbreak is still grappling with record-setting death tolls and a health care system on the brink of collapse. Many other hard-hit nations are, instead, taking tentative steps toward a semblance of normalcy. But Brazil is battling a more contagious variant that has trampled one major city and is spreading to others, even as Brazilians toss away precautionary measures that could keep them safe. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times On Tuesday, Brazil recorded more than 1,700 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day toll of the pandemic. “The acceleration of the epidemic in various states is leading to the collapse of their public and private hospital systems, which may soon become the case in every region of Brazil,” the national association of health secretaries said in a statement. “Sadly, the anemic rollout of vaccines and the slow pace at which they’re becoming available still does not suggest that this scenario will be reversed in the short term.” And the news just got worse for Brazil — and possibly the world. Preliminary studies suggest that the variant that swept through the city of Manaus is not only more contagious, but it also appears able to infect some people who have already recovered from other versions of the virus. And the variant has slipped Brazil’s borders, showing up in two dozen other countries and in small numbers in the United States. Although trials of a number of vaccines indicate they can protect against severe illness even when they do not prevent infection with the variant, most of the world has not been inoculated. That means even people who had recovered and thought they were safe for now might still be at risk and that world leaders might, once again, be lifting restrictions too soon. “You need vaccines to get in the way of these things,” said William Hanage, a public health researcher at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, speaking of variants that might cause reinfections. “The immunity you get with your cemeteries running out of room, even that will not be enough to protect you.” That danger of new variants has not been lost on scientists around the world. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pleaded with Americans this week not to let their guards down. “Please hear me clearly,” she said. “At this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we’ve gained.” Brazilians hoped they had seen the worst of the outbreak last year. Manaus, capital of the northern state of Amazonas, was hit so hard in April and May that scientists wondered if the city might have reached herd immunity. But then in September, cases in the state began rising again, perplexing health officials. An attempt by Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima to impose a new quarantine ahead of the Christmas holiday was met with fierce resistance by business owners and prominent politicians close to President Jair Bolsonaro. By January, scientists had discovered that a new variant, which became known as P.1, had become dominant in the state. Within weeks, its danger became clear as hospitals in the city ran out of oxygen amid a crush of patients, leading scores to suffocate to death. Dr. Antonio Souza remains haunted by the horrified faces of his colleagues and relatives of patients when it became clear his Manaus hospital’s oxygen supply had been exhausted. He thinks about the patient he sedated, to spare her an agonizing death, when the oxygen ran out at another clinic. “Nobody should ever have to make that decision,” he said. “It’s too terrible.” Maria Glaudimar, a nurse in Manaus, said she felt trapped in a nightmare early this year with no end in sight. At work, patients and their relatives pleaded for oxygen, and all the intensive care beds were full. At home, her son caught tuberculosis after contracting COVID-19, and her husband shed 22 pounds as he fought the virus. “No one was prepared for this,” Glaudimar said. “It was a horror film.” Since then, the coronavirus crisis has eased somewhat in Amazonas but worsened in most of Brazil. Scientists have scrambled to learn more about the variant and to track its spread across the country. But limited resources for testing have kept them behind the curve as they try to determine what role it is playing. Anderson Brito, a Brazilian virus expert at Yale University, said his lab alone sequenced almost half as many coronavirus genomes as all of Brazil had. While the United States has done genetic sequencing on roughly one in 200 confirmed cases, Brazil sequences about one in 3,000. The variant spread quickly. By the end of January, a study by government researchers found it was present in 91% of samples sequenced in the state of Amazonas. By the end of February, health officials had reported cases of the P.1 variant in 21 of 26 Brazilian states, but without more testing it is hard to gauge its prevalence. Throughout the pandemic, researchers have said that COVID-19 reinfections appear to be extremely rare, which has allowed people who recover to presume they have immunity, at least for a while. But that was before P.1 appeared and doctors and nurses began to notice something strange. João Alho, a doctor in Santarém, a city in Pará, a state that borders Amazonas, said that several colleagues who recovered from COVID-19 months ago had fallen ill again and tested positive. Juliana Cunha, a nurse in Rio de Janeiro who has been working at COVID-19 testing centers, said she assumed she was safe after catching the virus in June. But in November, after experiencing mild symptoms, she tested positive again. “I couldn’t believe it,” Cunha, 23, said. “It must be the variants.” But there is no way to be sure what is happening to people who are reinfected, unless both their old and new samples are kept, genetically sequenced and compared. One way to tamp down the surge would be through vaccinations, but the rollout in Brazil, as in so many countries, has been slow. Brazil began vaccinating priority groups, including health care professionals and the elderly, in late January. But the government has failed to secure a large enough number of doses. Wealthier countries have snapped up most of the available supply, while Bolsonaro has been skeptical both of the disease’s impact and of vaccines. Just over 5.8 million Brazilians — roughly 2.6% of the population — had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Tuesday, according to the health ministry. Only about 1.5 million had received both doses. The country is currently using the Chinese-made CoronaVac — which laboratory tests suggest is less effective against P.1 than against other variants — and the one made by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Margareth Dalcolmo, a pulmonologist at Fiocruz, a prominent scientific research center, said Brazil’s failure to mount a robust vaccination campaign set the stage for the current crisis. “We should be vaccinating more than a million people per day,” she said. “That is the truth. We aren’t, not because we don’t know how to do it, but because we don’t have enough vaccines.” Other countries should take heed, said Ester Sabino, an infectious disease researcher at the University of São Paulo who is among the leading experts on the P.1 variant. “You can vaccinate your whole population and control the problem only for a short period if, in another place in the world, a new variant appears,” she said. “It will get there one day.” Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, who called the variant a “new stage” of the pandemic, said last week that the government was ramping up its efforts and hopes to vaccinate roughly half of its population by June and the rest by the end of the year. But many Brazilians have little faith in a government led by a president who has sabotaged lockdowns, repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus and promoted untested remedies long after scientists said they clearly did not work. Just last week, the president spoke dismissively of masks, which are among the best defenses to curb contagion, claiming that they are harmful to children, causing headaches and difficulty concentrating. Pazuello’s vaccine projections have also been met with skepticism. The government last week placed an order for 20 million doses of an Indian vaccine that has not completed clinical trials. That prompted a federal prosecutor to argue in a legal filing that the $286 million purchase “puts millions of lives at risk.” Even if it proves effective, it will be too late for many. Tony Maquiné, a 39-year-old marketing specialist in Manaus, lost a grandmother, an uncle, two aunts and a cousin in the span of a few weeks during the latest surge of cases. He said time has become a blur of frantic efforts to find hospitals with free beds for the living, while arranging funerals for the dead. “It was a nightmare,” Maquiné said. “I’m scared of what lies ahead.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

His administration’s latest screw-up involves Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine.It seems that after the vaccine proved promising in clinical trials, the pharmaceutical giant reportedly offered the Trump administration the opportunity to purchase additional doses beyond the 100 million it had acquired (enough to treat 50 million people, as it is a two-dose treatment). But Trump, for whatever reason, declined.“We learned from The New York Times that over the summer, the Trump administration refused an offer from Pfizer to pre-order additional doses of the vaccine, so those additional doses—that we could have used—are now set to go to other countries,” Kimmel explained.He then threw to a clip of ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos interviewing Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief science adviser of Trump’s vaccine program Operation Warp Speed. When asked about a proposed Trump executive order that would prioritize vaccines for Americans before those in other countries—even though vaccine distribution is already underway in the U.K.—Dr. Slaoui couldn’t answer.The late-night host then pivoted to the numerous members of team Trump who have come down with COVID-19.

Photograph: Timothy D Easley/EPA The archdiocese of New Orleans has told local Catholics to avoid the Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot Covid-19 vaccine, because its early development used “morally compromised cell lines created from two abortions”. It said two other vaccines in use in the US, made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, were acceptable despite having been developed with “some lab testing that utilised the abortion-derived cell line”. The archdiocese made the announcement on Friday. The statement put the archdiocese at odds with Pope Francis. In December, the Vatican said it was “morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted foetuses in their research and production process”, as the use of such vaccines “does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion from which the cells used in production of the vaccines derive”. Cells derived from an elective abortion in the Netherlands in the 1970s are commonly used in medical research. Last October, it was widely reported that an experimental Covid-19 therapy given to Donald Trump, Regeneron, was developed using such cells. Like most Republicans, the then president had courted anti-abortion groups and moved to restrict use of fetal tissue in research. Fetal tissue research has led to a number of important medical advances, especially in vaccine development. Cell lines derived from aborted tissue were used in the development of the polio, chickenpox, hepatitis A and shingles vaccines. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine subsidiary Janssen used PER.C6 cells, a proprietary cell line derived from aborted tissue in 1985. The New Orleans archdiocese said it maintained “that the decision to receive the Covid-19 vaccine remains one of individual conscience in consultation with one’s healthcare provider. We also maintain that in no way does the church’s position diminish the wrongdoing of those who decided to use cell lines from abortions to make vaccines. “In doing so, we advise that if the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine is available, Catholics should choose to receive either of those vaccines rather than to receive the new Johnson & Johnson vaccine because of its extensive use of abortion-derived cell lines.” The diocese’s comments come as the US undertakes national distribution of three coronavirus vaccines authorized for emergency use by drugs regulators. Vaccine hesitancy has been a major concern throughout the pandemic, as vaccines need to reach a vast majority of adults to protect those ineligible to receive vaccines, such as children under 16 and the immune-compromised. More than 28.6 million people in the US have been infected by the coronavirus and 515,000 killed since the pandemic began. Joe Biden and Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and chief medical adviser to the president, are both Catholic. Asked about vaccine efficacy, Fauci told NBC: “All three of them are really quite good, and people should take the one that’s most available to them. People need to get vaccinated as quickly and as expeditiously as possible, and if I would go to a place where they had Johnson & Johnson, I would have no hesitancy whatsoever to take it.” Anti-abortion groups and Catholic leaders in the US and Canada have raised ethical objections to the origin of cell lines throughout the pandemic. In June, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote a letter urging the Trump administration to “incentivize” the development of vaccines that do not use such cell lines. “It is critically important that Americans have access to a vaccine that is produced ethically,” the letter said. “No American should be forced to choose between being vaccinated against this potentially deadly virus and violating his or her conscience.” New Orleans is not the only diocese to engage in anti-abortion rhetoric. In January, Joseph Strickland, bishop of Tyler, Texas and “host of The Bishop Strickland Hour on VMP Radio”, tweeted: “All the political posturing on vaccines is truly disgusting. “The fact remains that ANY vaccine available today involves using murdered children before they could even be born. I renew my pledge … I will not extend my life by USING murdered children. This is evil WAKE UP!” Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the New York University School of Medicine, told Science magazine in June: “There are better ways to win the abortion wars than telling people not to use a vaccine. These are long-over abortions. These cells are decades old, and even major religious leaders like the pope have acknowledged that for the greater good it’s not worth the symbolism to put the community at risk.” According to Johns Hopkins University, by Tuesday morning Louisiana had recorded 430,504 Covid-19 cases and 9,628 deaths. According to one vaccinations tracker, nearly 700,000 people had received at least one shot in the state.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '72ee03c2ebf68819ea9a57e43c71d931', 'title': 'CDC Says Virus Patients Can Be Switched to Another Vaccine for Second Dose', 'description': "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has quietly changed its recommendations for coronavirus immunizations to allow patients to switch the authorized vaccines between the first and second doses in “exceptional situations,” and to extend the interval between doses to six weeks, even though such changes have not been studied in large clinical trials. The new guidelines were posted on the agency’s website Thursday with little public notice. With the possibility of vaccine shortages on the horizon and little expectation that supply can be increased before April, the changes may offer a way to vaccinate more people — a high priority for President Joe Biden, who outlined his national COVID-19 strategy Thursday. A CDC spokeswoman, Kristen Nordlund, said the agency’s “intention is not to suggest people do anything different but provide clinicians with flexibility for exceptional circumstances.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president’s special adviser for COVID-19, has repeatedly advised against delaying the second dose or making any other changes in vaccination protocol without the data to support them. Earlier this month, Britain quietly updated its vaccination playbook to allow for a mix-and-match vaccine regimen if the second dose of the vaccine a patient originally received isn’t available or if the manufacturer of the first shot isn’t known. Some scientists questioned the move at the time, saying Britain was gambling with its new guidance. In the United States, two vaccines have emergency federal authorization — one by Pfizer and BioNTech, and the other by Moderna — and both rely on the same mRNA technology and call for two doses. Until now, the CDC has strictly adhered to the recommendations from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which specifically stated that the vaccines were not to be mixed. The updated CDC guidance still states that the authorized vaccines are “not interchangeable with each other or with other COVID-19 vaccine products.” The agency put the word “not” in bold on its website and noted that the safety and efficacy of mixing doses has not been studied. But “in exceptional situations in which the first-dose vaccine product cannot be determined or is no longer available,” the guidelines added, any available mRNA vaccine can be used for the second dose. With respect to dosing, the guidance says that the second dose should be administered as close as possible to the recommended interval — three weeks for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and four weeks for Moderna. But if that is “not feasible,” the agency wrote, the interval between doses may be extended to six weeks. The pace of vaccination is critical not just to curbing disease and death but also to heading off the effect of more infectious forms of the virus. The CDC has warned that one variant, which is thought to be 50% more contagious, might become the dominant source of infection in the United States by March. Although public health experts are optimistic that the existing vaccines will be effective against that variant, known as B.1.1.7, it may drive up the rate of new cases if enough people remain unvaccinated. At a White House briefing Thursday — his first since November — Fauci said that experts are particularly concerned about new variants of the virus in South Africa and Brazil, which have not yet reached the United States. He said vaccines still appear effective against those variants, but the variants may sidestep the immune system to some degree, making it all the more urgent for people to be vaccinated. “Replicating viruses don’t mutate unless they replicate,” Fauci said, “and if you can suppress that by a very good vaccine campaign, then you can actually avoid this deleterious effect that you might get from the mutations.” Federal health officials and corporate executives agree that it will be impossible to increase the immediate supply of vaccines before April because of lack of manufacturing capacity. And the current vaccination effort, which had little central direction under Donald Trump's administration, has so far sown confusion and frustration. Some localities are complaining they are running out of doses, while others have unused vials sitting on shelves. According to a senior administration official, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are on track to deliver up to 18 million doses a week. Together, they have pledged to deliver 200 million doses by the end of March. A third vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, is due to report the results of its clinical trial shortly. If approved, that vaccine would also help shore up production. If all of that supply were used, the nation could average well over 2 million shots a day. In April and afterward, the outlook brightens. Pfizer and Moderna have each committed to supply another 100 million doses by the end of July; the companies may be able to provide even more. A week ago, Pfizer and BioNTech, its German partner, increased their global production target for the year to 2 billion doses from 1.3 billion doses.

President Biden says there will be enough vaccine doses for 300 million adults by end of May, two months earlier than previous projections. https://t.co/ZZvBZrzDbr pic.twitter.com/HI7PKdyVn4 — NBCWashington (@nbcwashington) March 2, 2021 Just a few weeks ago, Biden had set the end of July as the target date for universal availability, but the timeline has been expedited, largely thanks to the addition of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the arsenal. Biden couldn\'t account for the third shot when he last addressed the situation because it hadn\'t been granted emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration at the time. But that\'s where the caveats come in. Tuesday\'s announcement was primarily focused on an increase in supply, which is just one aspect of vaccine distribution. At least some of the hurdles that the U.S. currently faces in terms of actually getting people vaccinated could still be there in May. For example, Biden himself acknowledged that "it\'s not enough to have the vaccine supply, we need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people\'s arms," and, as Stat News points out, the president didn\'t highlight any new efforts to increase the number of vaccinators. That said, even though it\'s still unclear if every adult will actually be able to receive a vaccine by the end of May, the U.S. does appear to be consistently increasing its vaccination pace, so the supply increase may have come at the right time.

"They\'re tired, and they don\'t see an end in sight."Coronavirus cases are emerging in their highest numbers of the pandemic, with more than 175,000 a day, on average, in a country that has seen more cases and more deaths than anywhere else in the world. More than 1.2 million cases have been identified in the United States in the past week alone, and the country is on pace to reach 13 million known cases in the coming days. Deaths are also rising fast, with more than 2,200 announced nationwide Tuesday, the most on a single day since early May.The spread of the virus rages on in the Great Plains and the Upper Midwest. Iowa and South Dakota continue to report new cases at some of the highest rates in the country, and deaths there have reached their highest levels on record. But the pace of the spread has slowed in those regions while rapidly increasing in other, more populous parts of the country, including in California, where more than 17,000 cases were announced Monday, and in Texas, where more than 20,000 cases were announced Tuesday, the two highest daily totals of any state during the pandemic.All of this has been unfolding on the eve of what infectious-disease experts see as a likely turning point for the outbreak in this country. Dr. Eli Perencevich, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Iowa, said he feared the worst was still yet to come in his state, especially with Thanksgiving gatherings and cold weather looming."Human behavior is very different indoors versus outdoors when it gets cold, so I\'m worried that\'s going to make things worse," said Perencevich, who has treated coronavirus patients. "And then we know Thanksgiving, where we\'re all just bracing, given that the hospitals are completely full."Unlike in the spring, when the Northeast faced the worst, and the summer, when the Sun Belt saw explosive growth, this latest surge has begun to move beyond a single region. In fact, it is elbowing back into places like New York City that had brought earlier outbreaks under control and tearing through cities that had not seen many cases all along."People just wanted some normalcy and got loose, and here you are," said Cyndi Kirkhart, who runs a food bank in Huntington, West Virginia, an area that is averaging a record 250 cases daily, more than triple the number from a month ago. "With the pandemic fatigue and all the politics stuff getting close to Election Day, there were so many things that contributed."The small city of Cumberland, in Maryland\'s Appalachian panhandle, also avoided the worst of the pandemic\'s first months.By midsummer, Emmanuel Episcopal Church, a Gothic Revival landmark overlooking the city\'s downtown, was inviting people back inside for services, though with disinfectant and temperature checks. The church rector and a part-time priest and their spouses dined together regularly but took precautions, usually staying outdoors.And even as cases started rising this fall on the northern Plains, infections remained relatively scarce around Cumberland and many other cities in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast."Then, right before Halloween," said the rector, the Rev. Martha Macgill, "it just exploded."In the first days of November, the priest and her husband were both admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Per capita, Allegany County, where Cumberland is the county seat, now has the worst outbreak in Maryland, and the Cumberland region has the 14th-highest number of recent cases per capita of any U.S. metro area."It kind of happened silently then all of a sudden it was bad," Macgill said.About 1,100 miles to the west, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the fall surge came early. Mayor Paul TenHaken said some people in his city wrongly thought they had made it through the worst after a spring wave, mostly confined to a meatpacking plant, came and passed.But the virus returned and hit the city hard: Two of TenHaken\'s five staff members tested positive, as have dozens of others the mayor knows. The Sioux Falls area has had the sixth-most known cases per capita of any U.S. metro area. Hospitalizations and infections remain high statewide but have slightly declined in recent days. TenHaken\'s unease remains."This week makes me a little nervous, just with all the travel and Thanksgiving and gatherings," the mayor said. "I think this will be the real test, how diligent people are once you get into the holidays."Elsewhere, in the Midwest, there are localized signs of progress, or at least stabilization, though officials say that it could all prove fleeting.The marginal progress in the Midwest comes after governors in some states, including Illinois, Iowa and North Dakota, imposed additional restrictions, and after hospital leaders across the region issued public warnings that they were running out of capacity to treat the sick.In Wisconsin, which for weeks reported explosive growth, reports of new cases continued rising, but by 4% over the past two weeks. In Nebraska, which also saw runaway growth, the curve has flattened, with 1% growth. And in Illinois, which has averaged more than 10,000 cases per day, infection numbers have also leveled off, especially around Chicago."This is going to take weeks, not days," Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said this week. "But is there a glimmer of hope? There is."Any incremental improvements in the Midwest has been more than offset by growing outbreaks elsewhere. In Los Angeles County, California, where cases have soared past the levels seen this summer, to an average of more than 4,000 a day, restaurants can no longer offer indoor or outdoor dining starting Wednesday evening. Around Miami, reports of new cases have more than quadrupled since the start of October, although they remain below the peak levels seen in July."We fully anticipate it\'s going to increase, but we just want to do whatever we can to not get into the same position we were over the summer," said Dr. Peter Paige, who was recently appointed the chief medical officer of Miami-Dade County. "It\'s a real threat."Epidemiologists and public health officials around the country said the reason for resurging outbreaks could be explained by a simple variable: what people choose to do.Dr. Debra Bogen, health director in Pittsburgh\'s Allegheny County, told reporters last week that the fast-paced increase in local cases was fueled by people letting down their guard."The virus itself hasn\'t changed -- what has is our behavior," Bogen said, recounting the story of an informal homecoming dance, organized by parents in a local school district, that turned out to be an event that led to multiple confirmed cases.In Kansas, Anil Gharmalkar, 41, who owns a trucking company and lives in the town of Oswego, believed that the virus was a "big city problem," unlikely to affect him.Then he got infected."COVID didn\'t care what I believed," Gharmalkar said in a video posted by the University of Kansas Health System, where he has been treated and received a breathing device that has been implanted in his throat. "I gave lip service to being careful, and I could have been more careful, and I wish I would have been."All the while, deaths are rising, the virus is raging and, for most Americans, a vaccine is still months away.What comes next? It depends in part, experts said, on how Thursday plays out around the country."Thanksgiving hasn\'t happened yet," Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said this week. "People can still change their plans and change the outcomes. We don\'t have to have superspreader events at homes."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

More than 420,000 Israelis have been infected and 3,325 have died.Israeli officials have not publicized the exact number of vaccine doses that it has received so far, or how much it paid for them, saying the agreements are confidential. But if it turns out that Israel overpaid compared to other countries, Edelstein said, the cost would still be worth it even to reopen the Israeli economy one week earlier than it otherwise could have done.Professor Jonathan Halevy, president of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, said getting in early had been a "correct strategy."With Israel having prioritized health workers and citizens ages 60 and older, Edelstein said that a majority of its high-risk population should receive the second of two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by late January. About 150,000 Israelis are being vaccinated per day.Netanyahu -- who is on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust -- has made the vaccination campaign something of a personal mission, taking credit for signing agreements and securing millions of doses from Pfizer, along with Moderna and other companies.With Israel heading toward another election in March, the country\'s fourth in two years, Netanyahu has made the prospect of a speedy emergence from the health and economic crisis wrought by the pandemic a keystone of his fight for political survival. He has held out the prospect of Israel becoming the first country in the world to be fully vaccinated.Political motives aside, the prime minister has won praise for his efforts even from some longtime critics, after being widely blamed for mishandling the crisis last year."We can\'t blame Netanyahu for all of Israel\'s ills -- correctly, most of the time -- and then ignore his contribution when something works," wrote Gideon Levy, a columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper this week.Netanyahu became the first Israeli to be inoculated against COVID-19 on Dec. 19, saying he wanted to set an example. On Tuesday, he dropped into a Jerusalem facility to congratulate the 500,000th Israeli to receive a vaccine.On Thursday, he visited a vaccination center in the town of Tira, in central Israel, to encourage a higher turnout among the country\'s Arab minority. Arab citizens, who make up one-fifth of the population, have been more hesitant than others to get the vaccine."We brought millions of vaccines here, more than any other country in the world relative to its population," Netanyahu said, adding, "We brought them to everyone: Jews and Arabs, religious and secular.""Come and be vaccinated," he urged in Arabic.Arab representatives say they have been battling a flood of disinformation about the vaccine in the Arabic news and social media. Dr. Samir Subhi, the mayor of Umm al-Fahm, where Netanyahu and Edelstein visited Friday, told Israeli television that he had sent a voice message to 25,000 phones in the area urging people to get vaccinated and describing the fight against the virus as "holy for everyone."Israel\'s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, which has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, was also seen as a population that might resist vaccinations. But those initial fears appear to have dissipated.Rabbi Yitzchok Zilberstein, a leading ultra-Orthodox authority in Jewish law, issued a public ruling after consulting with Balicer saying that any dangers posed by the vaccine were negligible compared with the dangers of the virus. Several important figures in the community were photographed getting the vaccine.So far, the government\'s inoculation campaign has not extended to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, who have not had access to any vaccinations yet, and the Palestinian Authority does not appear to have publicly requested them. Legal experts and human rights activists said Israel was obliged to provide the Palestinians with vaccines.The United Nations humanitarian affairs agency for the occupied territories said this week that the Palestinian Authority had applied for financial support from the global vaccine-sharing system Covax, and was working with international organizations on the logistics.Edelstein said the government\'s first obligation was to its own citizens, but it was in Israel\'s interest to help suppress the infection among the Palestinians. "If, God willing, there will be a situation where we can say we are in a position to help others," he said, "no doubt it will be done."At the headquarters of one of the HMOs in Jerusalem this week, the atmosphere was calm and orderly. A constant stream of people were seated in small booths and injected within a minute or two of their arrival -- much less time than it had taken them to get through on the phone to make the appointment.In Tel Aviv, City Hall and the Sourasky Medical Center said that to meet demand, they were opening a huge vaccination center in the city\'s iconic Rabin Square in the first week of January.Facilities have been accommodating toward younger Israelis who have shown up with older relatives and have sometimes called on the general public to come rather than throw away leftover trays of thawed vaccine that cannot be stored until the next day."We make use of every drop," Sharon Alroy-Preis, a senior Health Ministry official, said on television Thursday.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

EU leaders will have their first discussions on the vaccination certificates at a video summit on Thursday. The Department of Health confirmed that vaccine passports were not being considered in Britain because it is not yet known whether the vaccines stop you being a carrier. That could mean British tourists missing out on EU holidays because they will not have the vaccination certificates, which the commission said could be used in the EU “and beyond”. It is unlikely that Britain would accept the certificates from EU citizens hoping to travel to the UK. Brussels said that using the vaccination certificates to allow greater travel and tourism in the EU was “premature” at this stage but left the door open for the plans to be picked up in the future. “We feel that now this is the time for these vaccine certificates to be recognised across the European Union, and even beyond the European Union.” said Margaritis Schinas, a commission vice-president. Mr Schinas said it was “perfectly imaginable that this can open avenues for other use, including facilitating travel”. But EU heads of state and government would have to agree to the idea and enough Europeans would have to be vaccinated first, he said. The commission said member states should set ambitious targets to vaccinate at least 80 percent of health and social care professionals and people over 80 years old by March 2021 and a minimum of 70 percent of the total adult population by summer. The bloc started jabs three weeks ago and has so far approved two vaccines - from BioNTech/Pfizer and from Moderna - with others soon expected to follow. But its pace of vaccination trails behind countries such as the US, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. In a swipe at Britain, Mr Schinas said the EU had opted for “safety first” instead of granting emergency approval for vaccines as the UK had. “It is not a race between countries but a race against time in Europe,” he said. The commission said the EU would agree the minimum data necessary for the vaccination certificate and ensure it would respect data privacy laws by the end of January. The common approach could be “scaled up globally” by becoming a model for the certification systems of the World Health Organisation. Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose country is dependent on tourism, has called for the certificates to allow for vaccinated people to travel freely around Europe. Other countries, including Germany, are more cautious, especially after the arrival of the British variant on the Continent, and are against any plan which discriminates between those who have the jab and don’t. Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of Germany\'s 16 states were expected to extend and tighten a partial lockdown beyond January last night, as fears grow over virus variant strains believed to be more contagious. The former Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has told Times Radio he\'s feeling "optimistic" about being able to travel in 2021, and has already booked two summer holidays, including a trip to Italy in June.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Vaccines are on the horizon, but even the most optimistic timelines put them months away. And time with family during the holidays, normally a bright spot in winter months, is all but canceled this year.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBut there are ways to steel yourself for such a dark set of circumstances! In fact, some people have been through all of that and then some.Take, for instance, an astronaut who spent nearly a year in space. Or the station leader of a research outpost in Antarctica. Or one of the eight people sealed inside the artificial ecosystem Biosphere 2 for two years in the early 1990s.The New York Times spoke with these people to get advice on coping with life in extended isolation -- and how to deal with not quite being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.If there\'s one takeaway, it\'s this: Adaptation and expectation management are key.Just a Few Hundred Miles Away, but a World ApartFor 328 days between March 2019 and February 2020, NASA astronaut Christina Koch was floating 250 miles above Earth aboard the International Space Station, setting the record for the longest continuous time spent in space by a woman. An astronaut since 2013, Koch, 41, was trained to deal with long-term isolation and constantly changing circumstances, but there isn\'t exactly training on what to do when the world you come back to is wholly different from the one you left.But that\'s not to say she wasn\'t equipped."One of the qualities that astronauts develop is adaptability and managing expectations," Koch said. "And I think that we really honed the skill of being able to be OK with whatever comes down the road and to just adapt our hopes and dreams to what that situation is and make the best of it."While aboard the ISS, Koch and her crew mates watched the early days of the pandemic unfold, but they didn\'t know how deeply things would change.She returned to Earth in February, but just as she was finishing physical rehabilitation and ready to embark on the many plans she had made, Koch had to trade one type of isolation for another. "Right when I was ready to go back out into the world, it got shut back down," she said.To be clear, being stuck at home inside with all of the comforts -- and Seamless deliveries -- we\'re used to isn\'t exactly an apples-to-apples comparison to spending nearly a year in space. But many of the emotions and psychological bruises we are dealing with right now are actually similar to what astronauts experience in space, Koch said. And the strategies and tactics of dealing with those experiences can be quite transferable.For instance, Koch said that learning to accept and be comfortable with unpredictability is something that is built into astronaut training. During her time on the ISS, Koch said, there were days she would go to sleep knowing her schedule for the next day, only to wake up and have it entirely rearranged. And even if a day\'s schedule didn\'t have any surprises, at any moment something could go wrong, and the entire crew would have to adapt -- a mindset she uses while quarantining at home."What you can control is how you react to that situation," she said. "What you can control is whether or not you let yourself go down a bad mental path or not."In fact, while on the ISS, Koch was surprised by an extension to her mission by about five months. So in one sense, she said, she has been here before."I had to shift my thinking from, \'It\'s a marathon, not a sprint,\' to, \'It\'s an ultramarathon, not a marathon,\'" she said. "In the pandemic, that\'s what I have reframed. When lockdown started, it was going to be a two-week pause, and now it\'s going to last through the spring."Koch said a key skill she uses from her time in space is learning how to stay connected to loved ones when we can\'t be physically present. While in space, for example, Koch "ran" a half-marathon in Glacier National Park with her friends; at the same time they were running on the course, Koch ran the 13.1 miles on her space treadmill."You have to be creative in how you stay relevant in the lives of your loved ones," she said. "Staying relevant means you don\'t just communicate occasionally by email; you do things that almost feel like you\'re close."As for all those plans she had in store? This time she is just going to wait and see."I\'m a big fan of just setting expectations in my own mind to always err on the side of being pleasantly surprised," she said, "rather than being disappointed."\'Not Every Day Can Be Sunshine and Penguins\'Your average day this year probably looks a little bit like David Knoff\'s.He drags himself out of bed around 7 a.m., looks at the weather, then sips a latte while planning his day. He makes his morning commute -- a very short trip from where he sleeps to where he works -- and catches up on emails for a few hours before attending online meetings.Mealtimes are always the same, and the faces around the dinner table never change, except for the occasional extreme haircut or overgrown beard. To unwind, he might have some tea or a beer and reminisce about what life used to be like.But there\'s one key difference: Knoff lives in perhaps the most remote place on the planet -- and his most exciting evening lately involved penguins.Since November 2019, Knoff has led a team of 24 people at Davis Station, a permanent research outpost in Antarctica run by the Australian Antarctic Division. The yearly average high temperature there is around 19 degrees Fahrenheit, and during the darkest days of winter -- typically from May to July -- there are some weeks when there are zero hours of daylight."The darkness had more of an impact on mood and energy than many of us expected, for a few months during the depths of winter the sun barely made it above the horizon (or not at all)," Knoff, 35, wrote in an email.To get through a bleak winter, Knoff said, it\'s important to change with your surroundings and train yourself to learn to make the best of a tough situation. "It is surprising how well you adapt to your surroundings and conditions," he said.Not long ago, Knoff was unexpectedly marooned in a field hut for four nights with another expedition member after a blizzard got very bad, very fast, and their vehicle broke down. Stuck inside with nothing to do but wait out the storm, he caught up on a collection of 1970s literature left in the hut long ago. He also cooked and drank tea with his teammate."It was the longest I\'d been without Wi-Fi in years," he said. However, "in the end, it will end up being one of my fondest memories of my time here due to the truly unique situation of being that cut off from the rest of civilization, yet strangely safe and warm, with little to worry about other than the weather."Still, even a place as isolated as Antarctica hasn\'t been entirely untouched by the pandemic. While the continent hasn\'t confirmed a single case of the virus, Knoff and his team were forced to extend their stay by four months, which, he said, "brought with it multiple challenges and an emotional roller coaster."It "feels like we have just endured the toughest game of life we could have ever imagined, and then the game has been sent into overtime," he said. The goal now is for everyone to "look inside themselves to dig out the motivation and resilience to make sure that as a team we make the most of the next few months and return safely to our friends and families back home," he said.And about that exciting recent evening: A huddle of emperor penguins waddled onto the station\'s beach while half the team happened to be outside -- a good reminder to take the good with the bad."Not every day can be sunshine and penguins," Knoff wrote in an email. "You will have bad days/weeks/months, and the highs and lows will oscillate faster and higher as the months roll on, but stay focused on the positive and have a goal in sight."He added, "Although not entirely accurate during an Antarctica winter, the sun will always come up tomorrow!"Life in a Bubble Turned Pressure CookerYou have probably had a fight or two with your family or roommates during quarantine. But at least the house didn\'t break out into warring factions.That\'s what happened in Biosphere 2, a fully enclosed, self-sustaining, 3-acre ecosystem in Arizona in which eight people lived sealed off for exactly two years from September 1991 to September 1993, conducting one of history\'s most ambitious -- and weirdest -- science experiments. (The first biosphere, in case you\'re wondering, is the one you currently live in.)Biosphere 2 had everything: pygmy goats, a fog desert, feral pigs, Japanese silky bantams, a tropical rainforest and ... a lot of conflict, according to Jane Poynter, one of the eight people sealed inside."I wish I could tell you it was a happy success story," said Poynter, laughing as she recalled those warring factions. Poynter, who designed and was responsible for Biosphere 2\'s farm system during the mission, is now the founder and co-chief executive of a space tourism company called the Space Perspective."We broke into two factions of four and four," she said. "It turns out eight is the worst number we could\'ve chosen because you break into two factions of four that are very stable."Her theory of why tensions rose so high? "When you\'re enclosed for a long period of time, you come face to face with yourself."A shared sense of mission brought the factions together to complete work that needed to be done, despite the awful tension and awkwardness, Poynter said. None of the eight thought of abandoning Biosphere 2, whose chief financial backer was a Texas oil billionaire, because they could see the importance of the bigger picture.Fighting aside, Poynter noted another effect that affects anyone in long-term isolation, whether it\'s an astronaut, a researcher in Antarctica, a biospherian or just an average citizen wondering when this will be over: the third-quarter phenomenon.You\'ve felt this before. You\'re past the halfway point of something but nowhere near the end, and you start to drag. It\'s the "decline in performance during the third quarter of missions in isolated, confined and extreme environments, regardless of actual mission duration," according to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Human Performance in Extreme Environments.That\'s not to say we\'re necessarily in the third quarter of the pandemic, but the recent promising news of vaccines has given us hope that the end may be in sight."We are all going to feel like we\'ve had it up to here with this, and that\'s normal," Poynter said. "The only thing I can say is, be patient."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Hours Later, He Walked Away.', 'description': 'GENEVA -- In late May, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, Andrew Bremberg, went on a rescue mission to the World Health Organization headquarters. He told its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that despite weeks of threats that President Donald Trump would quit the health organization, the relationship could still be salvaged.Bremberg hand-delivered a list of seven demands that U.S. officials saw as the beginning of discreet discussions.Hours later, Trump took the lectern outside the White House and blew it all up, announcing that the United States would leave the WHO. The announcement blindsided his own diplomats and Tedros alike.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIf Trump thought Tedros would relent under the pressure of a U.S. withdrawal, he was wrong. The WHO leader has refused to make concessions or counteroffers, according to American and Western officials. And Trump ultimately made good on his promise to abandon a health agency that the United States helped form a half-century ago.With Trump\'s election defeat, President-elect Joe Biden appears ready to rejoin the global health body. But he will inherit a fractured relationship and must quickly make decisions about how to overhaul an organization that even staunch supporters say is in dire need of change.While the Trump administration\'s demands are now moot, they offer a glimpse into both the growing U.S. frustration with the WHO and Trump\'s personal grievances. And as Biden signals a return to multinational diplomacy, the Trump administration\'s demands offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the deal-making of a president who favored aggressive, unpredictable moves over more conventional negotiations.As has often been the case during Trump\'s presidency, his administration was divided, current and former officials said.Diplomats and veteran health officials said the list contained reasonable requests that might have been easily negotiated through normal channels. (The WHO has since made some changes anyway.) But it also contained politically sensitive, if not inappropriate, demands."It doesn\'t seem to reveal a clear strategic vision," said Gian Luca Burci, a former counsel to the health organization who reviewed the list for The New York Times.Experts said it was easy to see why, in the face of Trump\'s withdrawal and his efforts to deflect blame for the pandemic, Tedros chose not to negotiate."It was an enormous backfire, and it was bound to be," added Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and longtime WHO adviser who also reviewed the list. "It wasn\'t a negotiation. It was blackmail."The State Department did not directly address its proposed terms but said it had acted in good faith in calling for needed changes."At a critical moment when the WHO leadership had the opportunity to rebuild trust among some of its critical member states, it chose a path that did the very opposite and demonstrated its lack of independence from the Chinese Communist Party," Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, said in a statement.The WHO did not comment. Several current and former Trump administration officials and Western diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose private conversations.The U.S. list was the product of months of growing irritation with Tedros, whom senior administration officials saw as too quick to praise China or frame the outbreak in ways favorable to Beijing. Tedros, for example, announced in January that China would share biological samples with the world. But he declined to speak up when China never made good on that promise.The WHO had also quietly acquiesced to Beijing\'s conditions before an international mission in February and ceded control of an investigation into the virus\'s origins.Some European health officials and diplomats shared the Trump administration\'s concerns, officials said. But they regarded these as minor issues in the midst of a pandemic.Trump was particularly focused on the issue of travel. The WHO had a long-standing policy of unrestricted travel. As health experts began reconsidering that policy, Trump became preoccupied with getting credit for having halted some travel from China to the United States in February.By April, as Trump toyed with withdrawing the United States from the WHO, two camps emerged in his administration, current and former officials said. The first group, which included Trump\'s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, wanted to leave and rally support for a health agency built around Western allies.Others -- like Bremberg; Alex Azar, the health secretary; and Adam Boehler, head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. -- argued that only the WHO was backed up by a global treaty. If the United States could get the health agency to make changes, they said, it made sense to stay.That argument prevailed into May, and Trump wrote a letter -- which he released on Twitter -- with an ultimatum. He would leave the WHO if it did not "commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days."Exactly what changes Trump sought, however, remained unclear. The final list emerged from discussions between the White House, State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services. In Geneva, Bremberg consulted with European allies, who were eager to keep Trump from abandoning the health organization, Western diplomats said.By late May, the list stood at seven items. The first called for investigations into the WHO\'s handling of the outbreak and the source of the virus. U.S. officials said they saw this as an easy request; more than 140 countries had already endorsed these investigations.In July, Tedros would do just that. He appointed Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia, to lead an investigation into the response to the pandemic. A separate investigation into the virus\'s origins is slowly getting underway.Second, the United States asked Tedros to call on China to provide live virus samples and stop censoring Chinese doctors and journalists. This would have been a significant break for the WHO, which rarely criticizes members. Tedros has told colleagues that he sees no benefit in such criticism, especially during a pandemic.Conceding to the Trump administration\'s demand would have meant allowing one country to dictate the organization\'s posture toward another. But in Washington, one senior White House official recalled this as a key condition, a signal of Tedros\' independence.The third item asked Tedros to say that countries were right to consider travel restrictions during the pandemic -- a break from the long-standing advice that limiting travel would not slow the virus but would harm economies and delay medical treatment.The WHO had already begun to soften that stance by the time Bremberg delivered the list. In April, the organization called for "appropriate and proportionate restrictions" on domestic and international travel.But Tedros interpreted the request as demanding that he apologize to Trump and say the president was right to restrict travel from China, according to public health officials and diplomats who have talked to him. Tedros was wary of being drawn into the U.S. presidential campaign, where travel restrictions were a rallying cry for the Trump campaign.Gostin, who agrees that the WHO should study and revisit its travel guidance, said it was inappropriate for the United States to try to strong-arm the change. He said the list smacked of politics, not good health policy."It was all about my country, my politics, my election," he said.The fourth item on the list called for the WHO to dispatch a team to Taiwan to study its successful pandemic response. Taiwan is not a member of the health organization, and Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its own, exerts tremendous pressure to keep the WHO from engaging with Taiwan\'s government.The U.S. requests also called for the WHO to prequalify coronavirus drugs and vaccines for use around the world once they were authorized by major regulators in the United States, Canada, Europe or Japan. That could help fast-track important treatments, but it could also have been seen as allowing the United States to influence the health organization\'s drug-approval policy.The Trump administration also asked Tedros to ensure that countries like the United States that contribute heavily to the WHO are proportionally represented on the organization\'s staff. And it sought support for proposed changes put forward by the Group of 7 -- the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Canada and Italy. That request is moot, as the G-7 proposal has been folded into larger overhaul efforts.By the time Bremberg and Tedros met in Geneva, however, the political ground had shifted in Washington.Meadows, the White House chief of staff, believed that negotiations with Tedros were a long shot. Even if they succeeded, he argued, they would take too long and yield too little, one senior administration official recalled.Trump had already planned a news conference criticizing China. Shortly before the event, the president\'s national security adviser, Robert O\'Brien, joined Meadows, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Boehler in Meadows\' office in the West Wing, according to the official. From that meeting emerged a plan: Trump would withdraw the country from the WHO.Trump agreed and added the announcement to the news conference. He had done something similar in 2018, announcing that he was quitting a United Nations postal pact, only to reverse himself after winning concessions.Tedros showed no appetite for such deal-making. He told colleagues that he felt boxed in, stuck between China and the United States. Speaking to reporters soon after Trump\'s announcement, Tedros said that U.S. partnership had served humanity for decades."It has made a great difference in public health all around the world," he said. "It is WHO\'s wish for this collaboration to continue."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) tested positive for the COVID-19, but remains asymptomatic, after receiving the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine, his office said Friday. Why it matters: Lynch\'s case stresses the importance of continuing to social distance and wear a face mask even after getting vaccinated. Support safe, smart, sane journalism. Sign up for Axios Newsletters here.What they\'re saying: Lynch received a positive test result on Friday "after a staff member in the Congressman\'s Boston office had tested positive earlier in the week," Lynch\'s spokesperson, Molly Rose Tarpey, said in a statement, per the Boston Globe.  * "Congressman Lynch had received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and subsequently received a negative COVID-19 test prior to attending President Biden\'s Inauguration," she added.   * Lynch "remains asymptomatic and feels fine" but will continue to "self-quarantine and will vote by proxy in Congress during the coming weeks."   * It is unclear when Lynch received each dose of the vaccine.   * Lynch\'s office did not immediately respond to Axios\' request for comment. The big picture: Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the companies that have developed the two vaccines authorized in the U.S., say their vaccines are about 95% effective at preventing people from getting sick after getting the second dose of their respective vaccines.   * "It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (protection against the virus that causes COVID-19) after vaccination," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes.   * "That means it’s possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection," the CDC adds.   * It is also not yet clear how effective the vaccine is against infection and transmission, but researchers say it should prevent people from getting sick.

He vowed to return to Washington, D.C., for President Joe Biden’s inauguration, armed with guns to “embrace” the Second Amendment, according to a criminal complaint.He was scheduled to appear at a detention hearing on Monday afternoon.Proud Boy Charged in Capitol Riot Had USB Full of Bomb-Making Instructions: Docs“You want to say that that was a mob? You want to say that was violence? No sir,” Griffin said in a video posted on the “Cowboys for Trump” Facebook page the day after the insurrection. “No Ma’am. No, we could have a 2nd Amendment rally on those same steps that we had that rally yesterday. You know, and if we do, then it’s gonna be a sad day, because there’s gonna be blood running out of that building. But at the end of the day, you mark my word, we will plant our flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Donald J. Trump if it boils down to it.”Prosecutors warned that Griffin is a danger to the community and should be held without bail due to his history of threatening and racist comments. His lawyers insist Griffin should be released because he simply “got caught up in the crowd” on Jan. 6 and that “he believed he needed to carry firearms to protect himself and his family—not to harm people in Washington, D.C.”In a Friday memo arguing for his pre-trial release, Griffin’s lawyers released several interview transcripts between the FBI and the county commissioner. In those interviews, Griffin revealed his intention to attend a Jan. 20 protest that he hoped would be nonviolent—though he added that “no option that’s off the table for the sake of freedom.”Griffin told FBI agents he’d met the former president twice: once in September 2019 inside the White House and again in Albuquerque. He also attended the inaugural tree lighting at the Capitol in 2018.But Griffin’s relationship with Trump appears to go deeper. In March 2019, Griffin said he had a 30-minute phone conversation with the then-president after he organized a week-long horseback ride from Maryland to the nation’s capital in the name of border security.During the call, Trump welcomed him to the White House that summer, and that meeting appeared to take place in September.Montana Brothers Who Accosted Lone Black Cop During Capitol Riots Are Charged“He said, ‘Couy, that sounds amazing’... ‘If you will do that, then whenever you get here, there’s 20 acres on the South Lawn and the gate will be open to you at the White House where you can ride your horses right in,’” Griffin told the Alamogordo Daily News. “Then he jokingly said that he might have to get on my horse whenever I get there.”In February 2020, Griffin had another audience with Trump in the Oval Office, The Washington Post first reported. Photos of their meeting were posted on the “Cowboys for Trump” Facebook page, which has since been suspended, along with its Twitter account.“These photos are not being used for ‘political purposes,’” he wrote in a Feb. 18 post with images from the meeting. “I am simply posting these pictures of me and a friend. The friend you may recognize. Please don’t copy and paste these photos for ‘political purposes.’ If you do, snowflakes all across the land will begin to melt. But I post them only for personal reasons to show a friendship with a great man and leader!!”The photos show Trump and Griffin sitting and standing together near the Resolute Desk and another of Griffin watching Trump leaving on Marine One from the South Lawn.Three months later, Griffin released a video titled “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat,” in which he insisted he was only speaking theoretically. Trump promoted the controversial video on Twitter, writing, “Thank you, Cowboys. See you in New Mexico!” (Trump’s Twitter account was suspended in January after the Capitol riots.)In an interview with The Daily Beast, Griffin insisted he only meant Democrats who were dead in “the political sense” and suggested Democratic officials who insisted on strict lockdowns amid the coronavirus pandemic should be guilty of treason.“You get to pick your poison: You either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope,” Griffin said.A SoulCycle Influencer Crowed About Getting the Vaccine and All Hell Broke LooseSince his arrest, Griffin has continued his defiant behavior. In a Friday memo, a federal judge revealed that in the two weeks he has been jailed for his role in the riots, he has refused to take a COVID-19 test or appear at a virtual hearing. Griffin, who has been in isolation, could get slapped with contempt charges on Monday if he refuses to appear at his court hearing.“Simply taking a COVID-19 test, something hundreds of millions of people have safely done across the world, will allow the defendant to exit isolation,” U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui wrote Friday.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Revealing his long-awaited reopening “road map”, the Prime Minister will say school sports will be allowed when children return to classrooms on Mar 8 and all organised outdoor sport will be permitted from March 29. Guidance telling people to stay at home and in their local area will also lift on March 29, The Telegraph understands, with groups of six or two households able to meet outside from that date. However, the lifting of lockdown will be gradual, spread over at least four months with social distancing rules and guidance to work from home remaining in the near term. There will be four different ‘stages’ of the reopening roadmap, and to progress through them four data ‘tests’ must be met, showing that vaccines are effective and hospitals are protected. Mr Johnson said: “Our priority has always been getting children back into school which we know is crucial for their education as well as their mental and physical wellbeing, and we will also be prioritising ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely." The roadmap was signed off by key cabinet ministers on Sunday. It will go to the full Cabinet on Monday, with Parliament informed around 3.30pm and a press conference around 7pm. The document, close to 60 pages long, will outline four stages for reopening which roughly correspond to the months of March, April, May and June.', 'num_of_covid': 1}
{'_id': '13868423231c665d0b27c679964ec73c', 'title': 'Melania’s Ex-BFF: There’s Blood on Her Hands', 'description': "What we have all witnessed since the day Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States is criminal, and what I have personally experienced since the day he was elected on Nov. 8, 2016, is shocking, awful, disheartening and shameful. Every single MAGA mob rioter who stormed the U.S. Capitol did so “at the direction of, and in coordination with” President Trump, and it was an assault on human life and our great democracy. Unfortunately, our president and first lady have little, if any, regard for either.Everyone around them has stoked and massaged their egos and wittingly agreed to the falsehoods and poisonous lies, veiled as truths, that built this house of mirrors. I take responsibility for being Melania’s enabler, and her using me became the basis of our friendship. I can’t believe how blind I was to the depth of her deception and lack of common decency.I wish I could say I was shocked by President Trump's actions, but sadly I can not, or say I don’t comprehend Melania’s silence and inactions, but pathetically, they are both expected. Melania knows how to “Be Best” at standing up and reading from a teleprompter and not from the heart. She and her husband lack character, and have no moral compass. Although my intentions to support the first lady in the rollout of her initiatives were always pure, I’m disheartened and ashamed to have worked with Melania.Melania’s BFF Wants You to Know That Melania Wouldn’t Give You the Parsley Off Her FishIt is our moral imperative to instill in our children the skill set needed to embrace values of empathy and communication that are at the core of kindness, mindfulness, integrity, and leadership, all of which instill positive feelings of mutual respect. We all know that our children learn by example, and it goes without saying, it begins at home. Melania told me boldly, “Look, I know what the truth is, and it doesn’t need to be explained. Some things don’t need to be dignified with an answer.” As I said in my book, Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady, “A Trump is a Trump is a Trump.”Throughout the years, Melania controlled her image, created her fairytale narrative, and remained an enigma, which enabled her to play make believe. I felt it my civic duty to stop protecting her and to unearth the “most mysterious First Lady,” the world has ever known. By sharing my history with her, I unmasked her true identity and revealed an unvarnished portrait of a woman whose veneer I’ve stripped off, leaving nothing but an “unapologetically, skin-deep” woman. Only they could flick aside having their lives ripped open and all their regretful, hateful, humiliating moments splayed out for the world to see and judge. Melania and Donald are a perfect match.Melania held one of the most honorary positions in the world, one that so many brave Americans have fought and died for. Michelle Obama, and so many first ladies before her, accomplished so many things. Michelle was beautiful, brilliant and wise on the inside and out, and in spite of being criticized constantly, actually enacted programs to help children and military families instead of just talking about it. Since Melania wasn’t going to be “given credit by the media” and had little support, she resigned herself to just go through the motions. She left behind no legacy or profile to be proud of as First Lady of the United States. I made a life-changing mistake and continued working for Melania, even though I knew the environment was toxic after the planning of the inauguration, because I believed I could make a difference. What a fool I was, thinking I could make a difference in the middle of this den of thieves.Melania is no better than Donald is in terms of needing attention. She wasted a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a platform to make a difference in the lives of so many children and didn’t provide any of that. She was just there as an extension of Donald, used to “soften” his image, highlight his showmanship, and smile for the cameras. In her free time she took up “albuming” and made scrapbooks filled with photographs of herself. Melania is simply an extension of her husband, just as hypocritical, speaking out of both sides of her mouth, when it suits her best. The tapes push beyond the, “he said/she said,” and despite attempts at a public image of concern and care; what was on the back of Melania’s jacket wasn’t just by design, it's her mantra. It extends to responsibilities as first lady, which was, “I DON’T CARE.”Melania herself is a double-edged sword. As an immigrant, she represents the American dream come true. On the flip side, Melania symbolizes what is wrong in America. Millions idolized her and believed in her, but why? Name one thing that she actually accomplished. Try. People warned me not to work for them. And now, I can tell you, having seen it firsthand, that no one will escape the destruction created by these people.Melania represents what is wrong in America. She got a pass in life because in America, white, “beautiful” women who are silent always have gotten a pass. Melania has made “beautifully” designed parties, events, rooms, and comes across to children as “sweet and caring.” All these ideas go back to the ’50s where women were silent and pretty, racism was rampant, immigrants did the dirty work, and men made fortunes in dirty ways. Many wives of malignant American men have done the same. At their core they are Machiavellian. Win at all costs. And make it look pretty. Melania knows exactly what is going on. Melania has always had her own agenda, BE BEST says it all. Be Best no matter what the cost.It now makes sense to me why Melania kept her chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham, around—because she spent her time in office combatively speaking to the press and spreading falsehoods about others. It came as no surprise to learn, with less than two weeks to go, Grisham jumped ship during Trump’s self-imposed reprehensible implosion. Grisham was probably fired and used this opportunity to pretend she had a moral line in the sand.How Melania Trump Destroys Her FriendsAlso, at this moment, when children are asking their parents why people destroyed our Capitol, what will be her answer? Will she continue the lies that it was antifa? Or will she tell the truth, which is, Trump lit the match that sparked the rioting and decimation. He, his children, and personal lawyer incited violence and told people to riot.What does a mother do when a father is an abuser? Many still believe that Melania is powerless, but don’t be fooled; she is an abuser too, of the worst kind. The kind that speaks kindly to children. The sickness is under the skin. Melania knows and supports Donald and his viewpoints. If you hit him, he’ll hit you back harder. He’s the brass knuckles, aggressive guy, and she elects to grin and bear it. She turns a blind eye. The truth is she’s actually encouraging him to go for it. Be aggressive. She’s his biggest cheerleader. Well, he should pay a price. No one is above the law.The fleecing of America will be the legacy the Trump family name will be synonymous with, their time in the White House will always be aligned and maligned with scandal, and they will always be remembered as the most careless president, first lady and first family our country has ever known.As people are dying in America from COVID because of his ineptness, if Melania had an ounce of Eleanor Roosevelt in her, she would be out there getting the vaccine to people, supporting our nurses and doctors, and helping at food banks. They will depart the White House, with no regrets, leaving dead bodies behind, and driving off to Mar-a-Lago without looking back.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Can you meet up with old friends? The grandkids? Can you go grocery shopping without fear? To try to clear some things up, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been saying what you should not do after getting your COVID vaccine. Read on—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Dr. Fauci Says Don’t Travel “It is not a good idea to travel period,” Dr. Fauci said at a CNN Town Hall. “I mean, if you absolutely have to travel and it\'s essential, then obviously one would have to do that, but we don\'t want people to think because they got vaccinated, then other public health recommendations just don\'t apply.” He added: “Getting vaccinated does not say now I have a free pass to travel, nor does it say that I have a free pass to put aside all of the public health measures that we talk about all the time.” 2 Dr. Fauci Says Don’t Take Off Your Face Mask “One of the biggest things that are really not well understood as people ask, why should I even have to wear a mask after I get my second shot? And the reason is very clear that the primary endpoint of the vaccine trial was clinically apparent infection. So you could conceivably get infected, get no symptoms and still have virus in your nasal pharynx, which means that you would have to wear a mask to prevent you from infecting someone else, as well as the other side of the coin, where you may not be totally protected yourself,” says Fauci. 3 Dr. Fauci Says Don’t Gather With People—With One Caveat Dr. Fauci says gatherings are still off limits, with one exception: “You can start getting together as individual people, even though the risk is not zero, the risk becomes extremely low when you have both parties vaccinated,” Fauci told CNN Thursday night. “My professional judgment is that when my daughter wants to come in here and she is doubly vaccinated, I’m going to have her over to the house, and I’m going to give her a big hug that I haven’t been able to do for a year,” Fauci said. 4 Dr. Fauci Says When You’ll Have the Most Immunity “You can get some degree of protection, some degree that isn\'t durable, 10 days to 14 days after the first dose, but you can\'t rely on that. The maximum immunity begins about 10 days to two weeks and beyond following the second dose—that goes for anyone, regardless of whether you want to travel or not. That would give you as a group about a 94 to 95% efficacy and a good safety profile.” RELATED: Dr. Fauci Just Said When We\'d Get Back to Normal 5 Dr. Fauci Says the CDC Will Announce New Rules Soon Fauci said it was “common sense” that some relaxation on rules for those already vaccinated would be announced by the CDC—and it could be soon. "If I\'m fully vaccinated, and my daughter comes in the house, and she\'s fully vaccinated, do we really need to have the stringent public-health measure that we would if it was a stranger who was not vaccinated?" he said on CNN. Until then, don’t travel, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The news set off a wild scramble to make sure the coveted doses didn\'t go to waste, regardless of what state distribution guidelines demanded, the Los Angeles Times reports.Luckily, the freezer contained Moderna vaccines, which don\'t require as low a storage temperature as the Pfizer vaccines. But staffers still estimated they only had two hours left to use the doses before they expired. So with the thinking that "the more people we vaccinate just brings us closer to herd immunity," as Adventist spokesperson Cici Winiger told the Times, they got to work.Winiger first tried getting in touch with elder care centers in an attempt to get doses to older people whom the state designated as the first to get the vaccine. The hospital\'s chief medical officer drove 40 doses to one elder care facility. The county took back 200 doses it was storing at the hospital, and gave 97 of them to staff at the county jail; "they didn\'t think there was enough time to gain consent and organize a safe protocol for inmates," jail officials told the Times.Meanwhile, with a big-rig accident blocking a quick route to another nearby hospital, Adventist staffers contacted every medical professional in the area and asked them to report to four distribution sites in the area. Within 15 minutes of learning of the freezer failure, local residents were getting shots, and not a single dose was left unused when the two hours were up.

Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) spent as physician to the president, finding that Jackson made inappropriate comments about a female subordinate and drank alcohol while on trips with the president, violating policy. CNN obtained a copy of the report on Tuesday, a day before its expected release. Jackson, who served as the top White House doctor during the Obama and Trump administrations, was elected in November to represent Texas\' 13th Congressional District, and is on the House Armed Services subcommittee. The investigation into his conduct began in 2018, and the report says that the probe was "limited in scope and unproductive" because former President Donald Trump\'s White House counsel demanded on being present during all interviews with White House Medical Unit employees. The report states 56 of the witnesses who worked with Jackson said they "personally experienced, saw, or heard about him yelling, screaming, cursing, or belittling subordinates." He was described as a "dictator," "control freak," and "crappy manager," and only 13 witnesses had anything positive to say about him, CNN reports. While on trips with the president, the White House physician is not allowed to drink for 24 hours before the president\'s arrival until two hours after the president leaves. Witnesses said they observed Jackson drinking during two overseas trips with former President Barack Obama — in Manila in 2014 and in Bariloche, Argentina, in 2016. In Manila, witnesses said Jackson was intoxicated and made lewd comments about a female subordinate, with one person stating they also spotted him "pounding" on the door to her room while saying "I need you" and "I need you to come to my room." In a statement, Jackson told CNN the report was politically motivated, and accused Democrats of using it "to repeat and rehash untrue attacks on my integrity." He also denied "any allegation that I consumed alcohol while on duty."

Top of mind for many is, can you still take your medications? Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke with CBSN about just that during a Q+A session. “Patients often ask me whether they should be taking pain relievers either before or after the vaccine shot,” asked a healthcare worker. “I've heard mixed advice. What do you think?” Read on for his answer, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Dr. Fauci Says Do Not Take A Drug That “Supresses an Immunological Response” As for taking medicines after the vaccine, Fauci says “the mixed advice is based on the fact that there's very little data on that. I mean, if you're going to take something that suppresses an immunological response, then obviously you don't want to take something like that, except if you're taking it for an underlying disease.” Immunosuppressants are “medications that suppress the body’s immune system,” according to Johns Hopkins. “These are usually taken after an organ transplant to prevent the body from ‘rejecting’ the transplanted organ.” Keep reading to see what he thinks you can take. 2 Dr. Fauci Says Some Tylenol After the Vaccine Should be OK Aches and pains are a common side effect of the COVID vaccine. “If someone gets achy or gets a headache and it's really bothering you, I mean, I would believe as a physician that I would have no trouble taking a couple of Tylenol for that,” he said. “So again, people are going to come back and forth and say, well, it could mute or dampen the immunological response to the vaccine itself. I don't see any biological mechanisms why something like Tylenol would not do that.” 3 Dr. Fauci Said He Didn’t Think Anti-Inflammatories Would Be a Problem, but Is Unsure “There's the hypothetical theoretical. That's the better word,” he continued. “That may be something that's a true, anti-inflammatory such as one of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories should not be given, but I don't think that's going to be a major thing.”RELATED: If You Feel This You May Have Already Had COVID Says Dr. Fauci 4 Dr. Fauci Said Do Expect Some Side Effects, Especially After the Second Dose “If you are really having discomfort that usually would occur rarely after the first dose, you likely would get a pain in the arm and maybe a little bit of an ache, not very much of an issue there. That's what I went through personally, when I got it,” he said. “But the second dose of either the Madonna or the Pfizer in some people do get about a 24 hours worth of achiness, maybe some chills, occasionally a fever, a headache. You feel under the weather, as it were taking something appealed to you—like two Tylenol, every six or eight hours or so—I can see is going to have a major difference that might make you feel much better.” 5 How to Stay Safe Before and After Vaccination Follow Fauci’s fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live—wear a face mask that fits snugly and is double layered, don’t travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

"But interviews with central players, and documents including previously unreported emails, videos, and social media posts scattered across the web, tell a more encompassing story of a more coordinated campaign," ultimately "summoned and directed by the departing president" in "one final norm-defying act of a reality-denying presidency." The Jan. 6 rally at the Ellipse that led to the mobbing of the Capitol was originally organized by a pro-Trump group called Women for America First. After Trump decided on Dec. 18 that trying to get Congress to overturn his loss on Jan. 6 was his last best hope, the group, founded by Tea Party veteran Amy Kremer and led by her daughter, Kylie Jane Kremer, put together a multi-state bus tour to Washington, D.C. Two activists with close ties to Stephen Bannon — Jennifer Lawrence and Dustin Stockton — helped organize the effort, the Times reports, with funding from Bannon\'s "War Room" podcast and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. Trump tweeted on Jan. 2 that he would be at the event, and though "Kremer held the permit, the rally would now effectively become a White House production," the Times reports. Publix supermarket heiress Julie Jenkins Fancelli donated $300,000 and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones chipped in another $50,000; Caroline Wren, a former deputy to Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson joined the organizing of the event. Stockton, a hard-right gun activist, told the Times "he was surprised to learn on the day of the rally that it would now include a march from the Ellipse to the Capitol. Before the White House became involved, he said, the plan had been to stay at the Ellipse until the counting of state electoral slates was completed." The violent assault on the Capitol, followed by Congress certifying Biden\'s victory, spelled the end of Trump\'s post-election campaign, the Times reports, but "the same cannot be said about the political staying power, the grip on the Republican faithful, of the lie he set in motion," that the election was stolen from him.

Our hospitals in Utah are among the best in the world but they cannot give the best care when hospitals are at capacity and medical professionals are exhausted and spread too thin and that is what is happening now.”               The governor ordered a state-wide mask mandate until further notice and said casual social gatherings were being limited to household-only for the next two weeks.

{'_id': 'c71ae9f9689d223ba36429af1a5632aa', 'title': 'Where the GOP draws the line', 'description': 'Congressional Republicans don\'t always cower before Donald Trump\'s demands. Occasionally — very occasionally — they find it within themselves to defy the outgoing president or shrug off his threats in favor of some greater good.So it goes with the National Defense Authorization Act. Trump has threatened to veto this year\'s edition of the defense spending bill for two reasons: It requires the military to rename bases currently named for Confederate generals and — unrelated to any real national security function, but very related to the president\'s hurt feelings about having his election tweets labeled as the falsehoods they are — it doesn\'t contain legislation stripping social media outlets of some legal protections. No matter. The House on Monday passed the NDAA by a veto-proof majority that included most Republicans. The GOP-controlled Senate appears poised to follow suit. The whole episode, Politico noted, is the "first and last Trump rebellion" by congressional Republicans. Trump\'s huffing and puffing simply hasn\'t mattered."I\'m pro-military and I\'m from a pro-military state," Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) said, "so I\'m not really worried about that."On one hand, it is good in these deeply polarized times that Democrats and Republicans can come together for bipartisan cooperation on any topic at all. On the other hand it is also incredibly frustrating. Why can\'t GOP members of the House and Senate find their spines when Trump is threatening to usurp more than two centuries of constitutional governance by falsely claiming that Democrats stole the presidential election he lost? And why can\'t Congress get its act together on other, non-military issues of vital national importance?Right now, the legislative branch can\'t agree on a plan to pay for the rest of government — the House and Senate are expected to pass a one-week resolution to keep funding agencies at their current level. That\'s more progress than has been made on a desperately needed pandemic stimulus bill, which has been gridlocked for months. It seems the needs of ordinary Americans simply don\'t rate as highly as the need to buy new fighter jets.Indeed, it\'s a point of pride among congressional leaders that this marks the 60th year in a row both parties have come together to approve a defense bill. "The NDAA is one of the few pieces of legislation Congress passes year after year — because both parties and both houses recognize how important it is to honor our commitments to our men and women in uniform and to secure our national defense," Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said in a joint statement.That sounds reasonable, even noble, until you realize that the federal government has at least partially shut down 18 times since 1976 because appropriations bills weren\'t signed on time. Studies show those failures have taken their toll on the broader U.S. economy.Why, then, does military spending overcome the usual bad habits of Congress, and congressional Republicans in particular? Some of it is surely patriotism, or at least a desire to avoid appearing unpatriotic — would you want to run for office with a vote against funding the armed forces on your record? Surely not. It is also true that the defense budget functions as a kind of back-door socialism in America, a way for the federal government to prop up local economies across the country in the name of national security. The Pentagon scatters defense contracts far and wide in part to ensure continued bipartisan support for such funding."As a result, many members of Congress view defense spending as a bipartisan stimulus program, where the immediate benefits of continued investment — protecting local jobs — outweighs long-terms costs in strategic trade-offs, waste, or inefficiency," Rebecca U. Thorpe, author of The American Warfare State, wrote last year. The new NDAA, coming in at a whopping $740 billion, promises to continue that trend. (Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin III, President-elect Joe Biden\'s pick for defense secretary, doesn\'t seem a good bet to break the cycle — he serves on the board of Raytheon.)The Republicans\' decision to ignore Trump\'s veto threat fits a broader pattern within the party: It defers to him on most issues, except where the armed forces are concerned. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis denounced the president as a "threat to the Constitution" earlier this year, but resigned from the Cabinet only when Trump announced he was withdrawing troops from Syria. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has redefined toadyism during Trump\'s tenure, but has pushed back against attempts to end the war in Afghanistan. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has backed legislation that would essentially force Trump to maintain troop levels abroad.Outside of tax cuts, it is difficult to think of another set of issues that so unifies the GOP. (Though there are some exceptions.) President Trump has damaged every American tradition and institution he got his hands on during the last four years, and done it with the acquiescence of his party. But even he couldn\'t get between Republicans and their support for forever wars and bigger military budgets.More stories from theweek.com  7 criminally funny cartoons about Trump\'s potential pardon spree  Why Trump supporters won\'t accept election results  Trump\'s jaw-dropping vaccine screwup', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Shares slipped about 1% in Monday’s morning trading session. Specifically, Merck (MRK) will discontinue the development of vaccine candidates V590 and V591, and instead focus on a research strategy to advance two SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 therapeutic candidates, MK-4482 and MK-7110. The US drugmaker said that the decision was based on findings from the Phase 1 studies for the vaccine candidates, which showed that the immune responses were inferior to those observed following natural infection and those reported for other COVID-19 vaccines. Merck announced that it will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to ending the COVID-19 program. The charge will be included in the company’s generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results, but is not expected to have an impact on its non-GAAP results. “We are resolute in our commitment to contribute to the global effort to relieve the burden of this pandemic on patients, health care systems and communities,” said Merck Research Laboratories president Dean Y. Li. Merck emphasized that the drugmaker will continue to advance clinical programs as well as the production for the two investigational medicines, MK-7110 and MK-4482 (molnupiravir). Molnupiravir, which is being developed in partnership with Ridgeback Bio, is an oral antiviral, that is currently being tested in Phase 2/3 clinical trials in both hospital and out-patient settings. The primary completion date for the Phase 2/3 studies is May 2021, with initial efficacy data expected in the first quarter of 2021. MK-7110 is a potentially first-in-class recombinant fusion protein that modulates the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. Interim results from a Phase 3 trial found a greater than 50% decline in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. Full results from the study are expected in the first quarter of 2021. Last month, Merck announced a $356 million agreement to supply the US government with 60,000-100,000 doses of MK-7110 upon Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Merck shares have dropped almost 9% over the past year and the stock scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 6 Buys versus only 1 Hold. Meanwhile, the average analyst price target of $96.57 implies 19% upside potential over the coming 12 months. Following the news, Mizuho Securities analyst Mara Goldstein maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $100, calling Merck’s decision an “unexpected move.” “While this move was not necessarily anticipated and thus the shares could be weak on the news, other than a charge to EPS, we do not see an impact as we had not incorporated these programs into our valuation,” Goldstein wrote in a note to investors. “But the discontinuations of the programs and focus on the therapeutics is a strong statement by newly installed R&D chief, Dr. Dean Li, for a visibly swift and decisive action, albeit based on a negative outcome to focus efforts and R&D dollars appropriately.” (See MRK stock analysis on TipRanks). Moreover, MRK scores a perfect 10 on TipRanks' Smart Score, indicating that the stock has a strong chance of beating market expectations.

In its updated vaccination strategy, due to be presented to the country’s regional authorities on Wednesday, Spain’s health ministry said cases of reinfection were “exceptional”, and recommended that those who have had Covid be put at the back of the queue. The instructions currently apply to key workers 55 or younger, the next priority group to be included in Spain’s vaccination campaign and who are set to be given AstraZeneca jabs. Spain is thought to be among the first countries to impose such a policy. “The number of documented cases from reinfection is very low in the first six months after infection,” explained the new vaccination strategy document. Spain’s health ministry decided last week that the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be administered to people older than 55 due to a lack of clinical data on the drug’s effect on older people. For key workers and people from other risk groups of 56 and over, the plan is to vaccinate them whether they have had a Covid infection or not. Results from a study by Public Health England released in January suggested that the protection from reinfection from Covid created by naturally occurring antibodies was between 83 and 99 per cent. The results were based on two probable and 42 possible cases of reinfection among health workers within five months of testing positive. The Spanish government’s decision is in line with the advice from several public health organisations, including the national immunological society, who have called for a gap of up to eight months between a person being infected and having a Covid vaccine. “We must prioritise and advance at the highest speed possible, optimising each dose received to ensure it reaches the citizens who need it most,” the letter addressed to Spain’s health ministry says. The WHO also says that people who have had Covid-19 can wait six months before being vaccinated. As of Monday, Spain had administered 2.17 million doses - mostly of the Pfizer vaccine - with 839,000 people having received their second jab. According to the government’s new strategy, under-55s who test positive for Covid after having their first dose should also wait six months before their second jab. A recent study found that those who have already been infected with the virus had a far higher antibody response following vaccination than those who had not been infected and may only need one jab.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Merck will record a pre-tax charge for the two vaccines in the fourth quarter. The news sent its shares down about 1% in early trading Monday.  Merck was a latecomer in the race to begin with. It acquired one vaccine candidate by buying Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience. It developed the other one with a nonprofit research organization.  Rivals Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech as well as Moderna have already produced tens of millions of doses that have been administered globally. Others like Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca are racing to develop safe and effective vaccines to protect against the virus.  Merck says it will now focus pandemic research on treatments.

The two do find common ground on COVID-19 containment efforts like vaccine distribution and testing — both would allocate $160 billion in that category. But, there's not a lot of overlap elsewhere. The GOP package contains direct stimulus checks, but they begin at $1,000 per individual and begin phasing out for people who earn $40,000 per year with a cap at $50,000. The Biden plan, meanwhile, would provide $1,400 that begin phasing out at $75,000 per year with a $115,000 cap for individuals and $206,000 for couples. The GOP bill would also extend enhanced unemployment insurance through June at $300 per week, compared to Biden's $400 per week, which would last through September.

Ignacio Aguado, Madrid’s deputy president, said that the region’s health authority had received fewer vaccines than initially promised by the Spanish government, and claimed that the decision to reserve some of the first supplies from the end of December and early January was now vindicated. “We will focus on delivering the second doses, which are so necessary,” Mr Aguado said. Spain’s health ministry has marked out the strategy for regions to implement, with elderly care home residents and health workers the first risk groups to be vaccinated, and all other over-80s next on the list. Regions are assigned a proportion of the vaccines imported by Spain according to the needs of their population, but the Spanish government recalculated those numbers partly based on the regions’ different speed of use when Pfizer’s delivery batch was less than expected last week. Madrid complained that it received only half of the scheduled 48,750 doses on January 18, forcing it to re-examine its strategy. Madrid has used just under 170,000 doses, but only 4,000 have been second shots. Faced with a similar problem, the region of Catalonia has taken a different approach and opted to delay the second dose for around 10,000 people beyond the three-week time lag recommended by Pfizer. Catalonia’s health department noted that the European Medicines Agency based its approval of the Pfizer vaccine on the results of trials in which the time between doses ranged between 19 and 42 days. Nationwide, just under 1.3 million doses have been administered in Spain in a month. Given that the population stands at 47 million, the objective of reaching 70 per cent vaccination by the end of the summer remains a tall order.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

As we enter into the holiday season, it is becoming increasingly more important to slow the spread of the virus. Obviously, one of the key ways that people can do this is by quarantining if they are infected — especially if they are contagious. But how do you know if you are capable of spreading the virus to others? During a talk with CNN\'s Dr. Sanjay Gupta during "COVID-19: Chasing Science to Save Lives," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading infectious disease expert explained one way to figure out if you are contagious with COVID — even if you are asymptomatic. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.\xa0Dr. Fauci Says it All Comes Down to TestingAccording to Dr. Fauci, it all comes down to testing, and more specifically, the type of testing you undergo. "I think that our listeners and viewers need to understand that there are tests for different purposes."The first type, PCR tests are more sensitive and therefore more accurate.\xa0"If you\'ve been exposed — either symptomatic or not — expensive PCR tests that you can\'t get in 10 or 15 minutes, it\'s going to get at best a day and sometimes two and three days," he explained.\xa0Then, there are the less sensitive, less accurate antigen tests, which are a great way to "get a feel for what the penetrance of infection is in a particular group" — such "as a college, in a factory, in a nursing home" — even when nobody is experiencing symptoms. "If you get tested two or three times a week, the lack of sensitivity of that test will be made up for, by the frequency with which you get it," he explained.\xa0This second group of tests, the antigen, are also a good determinant of whether or not you are contagious. Basically, if your level of virus is so low that the test doesn\'t pick it up, you probably aren\'t going to spread it to anyone else.\xa0"Even though the sensitivity might be lower in the antigen test that\'s more of a screening test, if you wind up getting a level of virus that is not picked up by the antigen test, because it\'s so low, you could be infected, but your virus is so low that you are not infective," he explained. "You\'re not going to transmit it because it\'s not picked up by the antigen test.""I think that\'s something we\'re learning more and more about the more information we get, the more confident we\'ll be as to whether or not these tests can be used on a basis of screening to tell you, at least I\'m not infective to someone else," he concluded.\xa0RELATED: 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say DoctorsHow to Stay Healthy During the PandemicAs for yourself, do everything you can to prevent getting—and spreading—COVID-19 in the first place, since the vaccine isn\'t here yet: Wear a face mask, get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don\'t miss these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Brandenburg knew this could spoil the vaccine, which can only survive for up to 12 hours outside of refrigeration, said prosecutors. The damaged doses that Brandenburg tampered with were subsequently given to at least 57 patients.The warrant application, filed in federal court by FBI Special Agent Lindsay Schloemer, reveals that Brandenburg’s delusions went far beyond doubting the reality of the coronavirus. Not only did Brandenburg insist the “microchipped” vaccine would “turn off people’s birth control and make others infertile,” he was convinced that the physical world around him was not what it seemed, a coworker told investigators.“Some of the conspiracy theories Brandenburg told [the coworker] about included: the earth is flat; the sky is not real, rather it is a shield put up by the Government to prevent individuals from seeing God; and Judgment Day is coming,” the 26-page filing says.The coworker, identified in the document as pharmacy technician Sarah Sticker, told authorities that Brandenburg carried a .45-caliber handgun to work, which he said he needed “in case the military came to take him away.” Cops seized several firearms from Brandenburg’s home on New Year’s Eve.Sticker, who is reportedly the one that discovered the vaccines Brandenburg removed from the refrigerator on Dec. 24 and Dec. 25, told investigators that Brandenburg tried to “guilt trip” her after learning she turned him in.“If I lose this job, I lose my kids,” Brandenburg allegedly told Sticker, who said she feared Brandenburg was becoming “desperate” or “unhinged.”Sticker, who was unable to be reached for comment, also told investigators she saw Brandenburg researching the vaccine on his work computer, looking to see if there was a mechanism on the boxes that tracked the vials’ temperature.When interviewed by law enforcement, Brandenburg at first tried to explain away what he did as a simple mistake. He said that his attempt to render the vaccine doses ineffective was “a spontaneous act,” and that he “wasn’t thinking straight due to what was going on in his life.”“Investigators asked how this could be a spontaneous act when Brandenburg did it two days in a row,” says the warrant application. “Brandenburg did not have an answer.”In a subsequent interview, followed by an email included in the warrant application, Brandenburg confessed that he in fact did spoil the vaccines because he thought they would “alter the recipient’s DNA.” He further explained that he was in the midst of a “very contentious divorce” and wasn’t sleeping properly.“My actions were inexcusable and I deeply apologize for the harm I have caused,” Brandenburg wrote.According to divorce records reviewed by Milwaukee ABC News affiliate WISN, Brandenburg’s wife Gretchen told a judge that her husband was storing bulk food and guns in multiple rental units, fearing that the government was planning attacks on the electrical grid and the nation’s computer networks. She said she was so scared for her safety, and that of her children’s, that she left town.Last week, Brandenburg—who has since been fired from his job—agreed to plead guilty to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products with reckless disregard, and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each charge. His lawyer, Jason Baltz, did not respond to a request for comment. Brandenburg is due back in court on Feb. 9.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Neither of the main blocs were on course to win a majority, setting the stage for another protracted round of coalition negotiations or, even worse, a fifth election in two years to be held in the coming months.Even before another election can be held, Netanyahu could be forced out of office within weeks.The full results, including half a million mail-in ballots, are expected to be announced by Thursday, but Netanyahu already appeared to have virtually no path to forming a new government. While Netanyahu’s opposition is fractured, the results—if borne out by the final count—will dramatically affect Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and the first to be indicted on criminal charges. For the past year, Netanyahu has held onto power through a fragile power-sharing agreement which survived the opening of his trial on fraud, corruption and breach of trust opened last May. But without that agreement, Israel’s ragtag collection of opposition parties are expected to immediately vote in a new Speaker, and bring to the table a law that would prevent an indicted prime minister from staying in office. As a result, Netanyahu finds himself a hair’s breadth away from losing power even though his party, with an estimated 30 or 31 seats, is the largest faction in the 120-seat Knesset. All this after Netanyahu threw everything at this campaign, which would have secured him a sixth term in office.Bibi’s Trumpian Election Freakout Has Experts WorriedHe all but muzzled his ministers, making sure all public attention was on him. When the Central Elections Commission prohibited his party, the Likud, from adopting the health ministry’s vaccination slogan, “We’re coming back to life!” for the electoral campaign, he doubled down with posters of himself smiling above the words plastered on entire buildings.Netanyahu spent the campaign’s final weeks belittling his rivals and attacking individual journalists by name. “The media,” he claimed repeatedly, “is a party unto itself. It is the never-Netanyahu party.”Interviewed by veteran political analyst Rina Matsliah on Saturday night, Netanyahu pointed at his ear with the spiraling gesture that universally means “crazy,” and said, of her earpiece, “Rina, Rina, Rina, go on! Go on, Rina. Rina, Rina, you have anything else to say? You got any more for your loser app… you think anyone believes you? Anyone?”After supporters of Netanyahu’s Likud party crashed an event at which his rival Gidon Sa'ar was speaking, throwing stones and eggs at members of the public, Netenyahu said that he condemns “all violence against all candidates, and especially against irrelevant candidates like Gideon Sa’ar.”Knesset Speaker Yariv Levin, a top Netanyahu surrogate, has been accusing the electoral commission of prejudice in an apparent preemptive move to cast doubt on the election should it not go in the Likud’s favor.He made baseless accusations against the committee chair, Supreme Court Justice Uzi Fogelman, saying he took “bias, one-sided, illogical” positions.“It’s a huge dilemma for the politicians running against Netanyahu,” Chaim Levinson, political analyst for Haaretz, said in a podcast for the news site Al-Monitor. “Can they become as merciless and amoral as him in order to win? Because Netanyahu will do everything to win. He doesn't have any problem… Netanyahu doesn't care. And if you run against Netanyahu, if you are not willing to be like Netanyahu, you’re at a disadvantage, because he is fighting without any rules and you’re fighting with rules. You are not trying to kick someone in the balls.”In an interview, Gayil Talshir, a Hebrew University expert on polling, said Netanyahu’s predicament is a result of “Israelis’ exhaustion with the political system—not tiredness with Netanyahu.”There was a five percent reduction in voter turnout on Tuesday mirroring exhaustion among the Israeli electorate after so many elections in short succession.According to his rivals, that was Netanyahu’s goal all along.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'fdde72cab0c7d969d9c499c5e2ea011d', 'title': 'Stop Doing This Immediately, Dr. Fauci Says', 'description': 'There has been good news about vaccines recently—in the last week, Johnson&Johnson has announced that its potential vaccine is more than 70% effective—but that doesn\'t mean Americans should let down their guard and resume old habits, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading infectious disease expert, last week. One activity that should be avoided: Travel, which Fauci said was "not a good idea… period." Read on for more of his warning—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. 1 You Do Not Have a "Free Pass" to Travel After Getting Vaccinated "Getting vaccinated does not say you have a free pass to travel," Fauci said on a CNN town hall about COVID-19. "Nor does it say you have a free pass to put aside all the public health measures that we talk about all the time."The two current vaccines—produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—require two doses taken three weeks apart. "You can get some degree of protection that isn\'t durable 10 days to 14 days after the first dose, but you can\'t rely on that," said Fauci. "The maximum immunity begins about 10 days to two weeks and beyond following the second dose. That goes for anyone, regardless of whether you want to travel or not." Keep reading to see how you can get infected even after getting vaccinated. 2 You Don\'t Have 100% Protection With a Vaccine Fauci pointed out that even after you get maximum immunity from two doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, protection isn\'t complete. "That would give you, as a group, about a 94% to 95% efficacy and a good safety profile," he said. That means the vaccines do what they\'re intended to do: Prevent severe illness from COVID-19. It\'s not clear if they prevent infection with coronavirus or transmission to other people. "You could conceivably get infected, get no symptoms and still have virus in your nasal pharynx, which means that you would have to wear a mask to prevent you from infecting someone else, as well as the other side of the coin, where you may not be totally protected yourself," explained Fauci."It is not a good idea to travel, period," he added. "If you absolutely have to travel and it\'s essential, then obviously one would have to do that. But we don\'t want people to think that because they got vaccinated that other public health recommendations just don\'t apply." 3 The CDC Chief Agrees With Dr. Fauci: Don\'t Travel There is no better time to cancel your travel plans. "Now is not the time to travel," new CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, asserted last week. "But if you must, be safe and follow the CDC guidelines." This includes wearing a mask as well as testing and quarantining protocol. 4 The CDC Just Issued a Mask Mandate in All Transportation Hubs The CDC just issued a mask mandate in all transportation hubs, which includes "airport, bus terminal, marina, seaport or other port, subway station, terminal, train station, U.S. port of entry or any other location that provides transportation." "Conveyance operators must use best efforts to ensure that any person on the conveyance wears a mask when boarding, disembarking and for the duration of travel," the document said. 5 How to Get Through This Pandemic Healthy As for yourself, do everything you can to prevent getting—and spreading—COVID-19 in the first place: Wear a face mask, get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don\'t miss these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

That&#39;s more than twice the number of fatalities in India, the country reporting the second-highest number of cases in the world.               And as the U.S. crosses that milestone - losing on average 800 people a day to virus - the pandemic here is not localized in one or two epicenters: it&#39;s smoldering across the nation.

Ululations with a brisk drum beat were mixed into the program’s soundtrack.The show has a history of controversy, and this isn’t the first time its performers have used blackface on stage. In 2018, for a skit that was meant to deliver a heartwarming message about friendly relations between China and African nations, a Chinese actress donned blackface makeup and strapped on an exaggerated prosthetic derriere to play the role of an African woman. She walked onto the stage carrying a fruit basket on her head and was accompanied by an actor—a Black man—wearing a monkey suit.And, perhaps unsurprisingly, her character extolled the virtues of China—and thus the Chinese Communist Party.Arguably the most political of all the programs. pic.twitter.com/8Q7Uja1WwO— Eddie Du (@Edourdoo) February 11, 2021 The Spring Festival Gala is CCTV's annual variety show, airing on the eve of Chinese New Year. With more than 1 billion viewers at its peak, the roughly four-hour-long program is one of the most-watched television events in the world. Watching the program has become something of a yearly ritual for many people during the week-long Chinese New Year holiday. It covers music, dance, and comedy performances, at times linking up with current events, but with softened subtext that glorifies the Chinese government.This year’s blackface song and dance routine was choreographed by 70-year-old Zhu Mingying, who has been smearing dark makeup on herself since the 1970s, when she became known for performing “African” and “Latin American” dances.Zhu has been a member of China’s Oriental Song and Dance Troupe for about a quarter-century. The performance group was formed under the direction of Zhou Enlai, who was a key figure in the CCP’s takeover of China and later served as foreign minister under Mao Zedong. Zhou’s idea was to stage artistic productions referencing the cultures of developing nations for a Chinese audience. But now, nearly six decades later, the troupe’s ethos remains stuck in the 1960s aspic.China has a largely homogenous population—about 92 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion people are Han, and 56 ethnic minorities form the remaining 8 percent. Race relations and political correctness are viewed through a lens that differs from other places in the world. The idea of a “harmonious society,” as described by CCP propagandists, is to maintain stability through centralized power, and the party’s bureaucrats do little to adapt policies to fit China’s non-Han population. The state’s rules and regulations can even be discriminatory, particularly toward people who do not conform to the CCP’s cultural engineering.That outlook extends to how major events around the world are conveyed through Chinese media and international platforms with Chinese roots. Last year, when Black Lives Matter demonstrations took place in the United States and beyond, TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance, was accused of censoring videos of the protests. A TikTok spokesperson later said it was due to a “pre-upload issue” that impacted some hashtags, like #GeorgeFloyd, that happened to link up with the movement.In recent years, relations between China and African nations have been shaped by CCP leader Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, which functions as diplomatic outreach via infrastructure development and financing for developing nations. The idea is for China to form tight economic ties on every populated continent, with all roads—literal and metaphorical—leading to Beijing. Critics, including the U.S. State Department, characterize Xi’s Belt and Road as “debt-trap diplomacy.” Now, that extends to vaccine diplomacy too.But China’s strong economic ties with African nations do not immediately translate to respect for people of other cultures. Broadly speaking, stereotypes remain deeply rooted.One area in southeastern China’s Guangzhou, where Asia’s largest African community lived and worked, was once called “Chocolate City.” Local news reports have characterized this part of Guangzhou as a den for drug dealers, drug users, and criminals. Police raids are frequent. Sections of the area have been demolished for “beautification” purposes. The once bustling street markets that gave the neighborhood a vibrant character are nowhere to be found. Some Africans who remained in Guangzhou during the pandemic were forced into quarantine even though they had not traveled abroad. Others were evicted by their Chinese landlords and became homeless.Last May, Zhao Lijian, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson who once suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is a bioweapon released on Chinese soil by the U.S. military, said China has “zero tolerance for discrimination.”Yeah, sure.In two tweets, the Black China Caucus, an organization that amplifies the voices of Black individuals whose work relates to China, wrote that “while supporters of the practice allege that blackface centers on empathy & realism. It’s difficult to disassociate it from a long history of minstrelsy & fixation on problematic caricatures,” adding that they hoped the event’s organizers would put an end to the practice and “hire some of thousands of Black people living in many parts of China.”Indeed, on Chinese social media platforms, there are viewers who defend the use of blackface in the New Year’s gala, arguing that it somehow makes the performance seem more realistic. But for the most part, few cared enough to comment about it. China’s racial tensions are unique, often manifesting in the conflicts between the central government and the different cultures and religions of Tibet and Xinjiang. That means that, for now, blackface will likely stay on air.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'dc140edcaad4303ff10ee46a3de77afe', 'title': 'How 700 Epidemiologists Are Living Now, and What They Think Is Next', 'description': 'Even with coronavirus vaccines on the way, many epidemiologists do not expect their lives to return to pre-pandemic normal until most Americans are vaccinated. In the meantime, most have eased up on some precautions -- now going to the grocery store or seeing friends outdoors, for example -- but are as cautious as ever about many activities of daily life.In a new informal survey of 700 epidemiologists by The New York Times, half said they would not change their personal behavior until at least 70% of the population was vaccinated. Thirty percent said they would make some changes once they were vaccinated themselves.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesA minority of the epidemiologists said that if highly effective vaccines were widely distributed, it would be safe for Americans to begin living more freely this summer."I am optimistic that the encouraging vaccine results mean we\'ll be back on track by or during summer 2021," said Kelly Strutz, an assistant professor at Michigan State University.But most said that even with vaccines, it would probably take a year or more for many activities to safely restart and that some parts of their lives may never return to the way they were.Karin Michels, professor of epidemiology at UCLA, said it would probably be many years until it was safe enough to "return to approximately the lifestyle we had." She said, "We have to settle to live with the virus."Epidemiologists are worried about many unknowns, including how long immunity lasts; how the virus may mutate; the challenges of vaccine distribution; and the possible reluctance to accept the vaccine among some groups.On the eve of the COVID winter, the epidemiologists are living with stringent precautions and new workarounds in place, far stricter than those of many ordinary Americans. Yet those precautions have evolved since the spring, as scientists have learned more about how the coronavirus spreads and what prevents it.Of 23 activities of daily life that the survey asked about, there were only three that the majority of respondents had done in the past month: gathering outdoors with friends; bringing in mail without precautions; and running errands, like going to the grocery store or pharmacy.The epidemiologists have almost entirely avoided other parts of pre-pandemic life -- including activities that many Americans are doing now. Almost none said they had attended a sporting event, play or concert; met up with someone they didn\'t know well; or attended a wedding or funeral."Being in close proximity to people I don\'t know will always feel less safe than it used to," said Ellicott Matthay, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, San Francisco.Three-quarters of respondents said they planned to spend Christmas, Hanukkah or other winter holidays only with members of their household, or not celebrate at all, similar to how they spent Thanksgiving.When asked about the safest and riskiest activities on the list, most epidemiologists agreed on these general principles: They are less worried about outdoor activities and about touching surfaces, and more worried about indoor activities and those with large groups. But even the epidemiologists didn\'t all agree on their assessment of risk."Indoor venues with lots of people is the riskiest situation," said Leland Ackerson of the University of Massachusetts. "Outdoors with few people, social distancing and precautions is the least risky." He said that during the past month, he had hiked with friends, opened mail without precautions and run errands.Six months ago, we asked a similar group of epidemiologists about when life might go back to normal. Most then guessed that people would need to wait a year or more for many aspects of daily life to normalize. This time, as the spread of the virus has worsened but the treatments have improved, we focused our questions on how they have been living in the thick of the pandemic."It\'s funny: When you asked this before, I was so optimistic about the U.S. being able to lead and address this in a timely fashion," said Rachel Widome, associate professor at the University of Minnesota. "I told you I thought things would be better by now. I was very wrong. They are dramatically worse."Most scientists say around 70% of the population will need to be immune for the United States to reach herd immunity, when the virus slows down significantly or stops. Herd immunity is crucial, they say, for people to safely resume many parts of life, and the fastest and safest way to achieve it is through vaccination. Moncef Slaoui, who is leading the government\'s Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, said this week that vaccines may roll out quickly enough for the United States to reach herd immunity by early summer. But scientists do not yet know if vaccinated people could still spread the virus.Nearly a third of respondents said they would be comfortable returning to more activities of daily life once they were vaccinated. Some said they would feel comfortable doing only certain things, like socializing with people who had also been vaccinated. A few said they would wait until the country had reached the herd immunity threshold and they had received a vaccine themselves."I would change some behaviors but not others," said Gabriela Vazquez Benitez, a senior research investigator at HealthPartners Institute, a nonprofit group. "I would do some minimal travel, small indoor gatherings with other close relatives when I am vaccinated, but maintain safety precautions such as wearing a mask and social distance."Since the spring, 79% of the epidemiologists said that their assessment of various risks had changed and that they had adjusted their behaviors accordingly. Science is a process, they said, and the virus is new, so even those studying it most closely have learned things along the way.Some said they were less worried than in the spring about socializing outdoors, touching surfaces or sending young children to school. They were more worried about indoor air transmission and the dangers of not wearing masks.About 8,000 epidemiologists were invited to participate in our survey, which was circulated by email to the membership of the Society for Epidemiologic Research and to individual scientists, and which was conducted from Nov. 18 to Dec. 2. Of the 700 who participated, around three-quarters work in academia; a similar share is doing work that is at least partly related to the coronavirus.In keeping with their informal professional motto, many of them emphasized that their answers could change depending on circumstances. The phrase "it depends" appeared 45 times in their responses."It entirely depends upon what we do as a nation to address the pandemic," said Emeli Anderson, a doctoral student of epidemiology at Emory. "Right now, we are not nearly doing enough."Many epidemiologists expressed disappointment and frustration that public health messaging had not been more effective, and that a growing share of Americans seemed to distrust science. They feared that the politicization of measures like wearing masks and staying home would have long-term consequences."This virus has humbled me as a professional and a person," said Michelle Odden, associate professor of epidemiology at Stanford. "I did not think this level of failure in a federal response was possible in the United States. We have a lot of work to do."As for the future, some said that parts of life could begin to return to normal sometime in the summer, thanks to vaccines. Others said some things would stay different, assuming a highly effective therapeutic drug isn\'t developed. The most mentioned change: the persistence of mask-wearing, particularly in crowded places or when they felt sick."I expect that wearing a mask will become part of my daily life, moving forward, even after a vaccine is deployed," said Amy Hobbs, a research associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Many said they planned to keep working from home at least part of the time. Some said they would always be more hesitant about greeting people with a handshake or a hug, being in crowded places or traveling internationally."I think it will be a few years before gathering with large groups of people in crowded public places and being on airplanes and other public transportation will feel safe to me," said Beth Molnar, an associate professor at Northeastern University.Others cautioned that even when the physical dangers of the pandemic recede, other consequences are likely to be long-lasting. They mentioned the effects of isolation on children\'s developing brains; the exposure of deep inequities in health care and in safety nets; and the fear and sadness of so much illness and death."Mental health care will continue to be essential," said Daniel Vader, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. "This is a traumatic time, and many of us will be affected by the worry and grief it has induced for the rest of our lives."--What epidemiologists said about life after the vaccine:What share of the population would need to be vaccinated before you changed your behavior?"If more than half the population is vaccinated, I would feel a little less stressed and anxious when heading out to do errands I normally do. I might actually feel comfortable to eat in a restaurant or see friends again one day if this is possible." -- Vijaya L. Seegulam, research project manager, Boston University"Vaccinations have become a political issue in this country. I can only control my own actions. So once I was vaccinated, I would feel more comfortable changing my risk profile in small ways." -- Michaela George, assistant professor, Dominican University of California"Once I and my family are vaccinated, I would change behaviors, except I can\'t imagine being in a crowd or attending any crowded events until 80% or more are vaccinated." -- Julie Bettinger, associate professor, University of British ColumbiaHow and when will life go back to normal?"For some, it has gone back to normal, and because of this, it will be two to three years before things are back to normal for the cautious, at least in the U.S." -- Cathryn Bock, associate professor, Wayne State University"The new normal will be continued masking for the next 12 to 18 months and possibly the next few years. This is a paradigm shift." -- Roberta Bruhn, co-director, Vitalant Research Institute"I think widespread availability of vaccines will result in the further relaxation of most precautions by mid-to-late summer 2021." -- Michael Webster-Clark, postdoctoral researcher, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"It\'s hard for me to imagine that it will ever go back to our previous \'normal,\' but I do think that new preventive measures that we\'ve had to adopt, like masks, will feel normal in time. In that sense, I\'m optimistic that life will settle into a new kind of normal." -- Marilyn Tseng, assistant professor, Cal Poly"It is normal now; similar to 2019, never again." -- Vasily Vlassov, professor, HSE University, MoscowWhat will never return to normal?"My relationships with people who have taken this pandemic lightly and ignored public health messages and recommendations." -- Victoria Holt, professor emeritus, University of Washington"Every part of my daily life that involves interaction with anyone other than my spouse." -- Charles Poole, associate professor, University of North Carolina"Staying home with my children has taught me that life with fewer errands to run and activities to partake in is kind of nice. I think in the future we will cut down on our family obligations." -- Jennifer Nuzzo, associate professor, Johns Hopkins"I won\'t take traveling to my extended family for granted." -- Alicia Allen, assistant professor, University of Arizona"I will never again have to explain what an epidemiologist is." -- Janet Rich-Edwards, associate professor, HarvardThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Regrets, No.', 'description': 'Two and a half hours after being injected with a COVID-19 vaccine, Dr. Taneisha Wilson was hit with the worst headache of her life.In her home office in Cranston, Rhode Island, Wilson, 38, an emergency physician with a constitution she calls "horse-like," laid her head down on the desk. Fighting a wave of nausea, she let out an involuntary groan loud enough to be heard by her husband in a room down the hall."Are you OK, babe?" he called.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"It felt like I got smacked," Wilson recalled in an interview.That is not how most people who get the vaccine feel afterward, but reactions like Wilson\'s were not uncommon in the clinical trial results of the two COVID vaccines now being distributed across the country. Pfizer, the company that makes the one she received, reported that some 13% of recipients ages 18 to 55 had a bad headache after the first dose. About 16% of those who received the other vaccine, made by Moderna, in a late-stage trial had a reaction strong enough to prevent them from going about their daily routine.As tens of millions of Americans await their turn for a shot, many are hungering for details about what to expect. So, at the request of friends, colleagues and reporters, some people like Wilson who were in the vanguard of the biggest vaccination program in U.S. history are beginning to offer their personal accounts.The New York Times interviewed several dozen of the newly vaccinated in the days afterward. They recounted a wide spectrum of responses, from no reaction at all -- "Can\'t even tell I had the shot," said a hospital worker in Iowa City, Iowa -- to symptoms like uncontrolled shivering and "brain fog." A nurse assistant in Glendora, California, wondered whether the fever he ran was a side effect of the vaccine or a sign that he had been infected by one of his COVID patients.And there was a dizzying variety of sore arms. Some likened the pain to that from a flu shot; for others, it was considerably worse.Like nearly every vaccine recipient who spoke to The Times for this article, Wilson stressed that she had no regrets about getting the shot, despite the headache, which was gone within 36 hours. The Food and Drug Administration has found the vaccines to be safe and remarkably effective. And public health leaders say mass vaccination is the only hope for controlling the virus that is now claiming the lives of close to 3,000 Americans a day.But in these first weeks of vaccination, there is an inescapable element of suspense.Along with a card reminding them when to get the necessary second dose, vaccine recipients are handed information on how to report side effects to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an app called V-Safe.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both rely on a genetic technology that has never before yielded a vaccine that won regulatory approval. They are authorized for emergency use only. Studies of their safety, including the cases of an Alaska health care worker and a Boston doctor who experienced severe allergic reactions after receiving their shots, are still underway.And as Wilson crawled into bed at 10:30 on a weekday morning, she could not help but be "hyper-aware," she said, "that I had just been vaccinated with this novel vaccine."Navigating a Brain FogAs vaccines go, experts have agreed, the two being distributed now elicit more reactions than most.At the Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown, West Virginia, Betty Shannon, 81, said some fellow residents had an upset stomach after becoming some of the nation\'s first seniors to receive a COVID vaccine.Lorenzo Alfonso, 34, a nurse assistant in California, was unusually tired and achy.Delayna Frint, a nurse in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, said her arm was so sore after the shot that in order to hang intravenous therapy bags, she had to lower the stands.But for infectious disease experts, a nation down for the count with post-vaccine malaise would be the best news in a long time. The side effects dissipate within a few days, and they are a signal, the experts say, that the vaccine is working."We call them \'side\' effects, but it\'s really just an effect," said Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania vaccinologist who is a member of the FDA\'s vaccine advisory panel. "This is what your immune response does when it\'s responding to an infection."The vaccines each work by prompting the body to make a particular protein that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells; neither exposes the recipient to the virus itself. The presence of that protein in the body sets off the production of new antibodies that can destroy the protein -- the key to providing protection against a future invasion of the actual virus. But the process also releases substances that can cause inflammation, which can result in fever, fatigue, headache and other symptoms.Many more participants in the vaccine trials registered discomfort after the second dose, given three or four weeks later, than after the first. That is probably because by that time, the body is already primed to attack the protein, experts said.Most of the reactions experienced by the 1.9 million Americans who received a vaccine this month had already been seen among the roughly 35,000 people who were vaccinated in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials. But experts expect new ones to appear: "If it\'s a one-in-a-million thing, you need a million to see even one," said Dr. Peter Doshi, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.Some may be mild allergic reactions, like the "body-wide itching" and "mild, small hives along forearm" that Dr. Megan Hajjar of Farmington, Connecticut, described in a Facebook post with a video clip. Or they may be more severe, like the handful of cases of anaphylaxis that the CDC has already identified.And others may simply be more intense versions of what the trials called "fatigue." Alyson MacGregor, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University and an accomplished home chef, said she spent the day after her vaccination in a mental fog that turned her attempt at the most basic of meals into an inedible blob."I can\'t believe I messed up ramen," she told her husband that night.She felt, she said, as if "there was a cloud over me, following me around."Debating DisclosureThe first several million doses of both vaccines are earmarked for health care workers and for nursing home residents who are at elevated risk of dying from COVID-19 if they become infected.Public health leaders have estimated that more than 200 million Americans will need to be vaccinated to effectively prevent the virus from spreading. In polls, a substantial fraction have expressed hesitancy about receiving COVID vaccinations. And some front-line health workers have wrestled with whether discussing their own side effects might deter others from getting vaccinated."I do worry -- is it going to encourage someone to have second thoughts?" said Dr. Matthew Harris, 38, an emergency medicine doctor in Great Neck, New York.Harris was up all night with a fever, shivering underneath a blanket, after receiving the first shot. He had joint pain in his wrists and shoulders that lasted into the next day.But he had already published a post on Facebook about receiving his shot. It had been an especially emotional moment for him, nine months to the day after he was hospitalized with a severe case of COVID and did not know whether he would survive to see his wife and two young children again."Please," one nonmedical friend commented on his vaccination post, "let us know what the experience is like!!!"So the next day, he posted about his reaction, with the hashtag stillworthit."Everyone has read, \'This is the light at the end of the tunnel,\'" Harris said in an interview. "But are people going to feel great 100% of the time after this vaccine? No. And if we\'re not honest with them, how can we expect them to trust us?"Dr. Sylvia Owusu-Ansah, an emergency physician in Pittsburgh, has also opted to chronicle her vaccine side effects on Facebook. She is African American, and at the livestreamed inoculation earlier this month, she told reporters that she "wanted to share with my community that it is OK." Distrust of the vaccine is particularly high among Black Americans, because of a history of mistreatment of Black people by the medical establishment.In the name of transparency, Owusu-Ansah recorded "mild muscle aches and pains with left arm soreness" on day one and "nasal congestion, mild headache" on days three through five -- pointedly beginning her posts with "I AM STILL HERE!"Another DoseForty-eight hours after Wilson\'s post-vaccine headache sent her to bed, she returned to her job in the emergency room at a hospital. Like many hospitals around the nation, its intensive care unit was crowded with COVID cases. On one recent shift, Wilson said, there were 12 patients in the critical care bay and only one bed available in the ICU to take them."These are people having strokes, myocardial infarction that need catheterization," she recalled. "You have to understand the reality."That time, Wilson said, it wasn\'t a vaccine side effect that made her feel as if she was going to throw up.She is scheduled for her second dose of the vaccine next month.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

States are free to interpret the HHS\'s suggestions for rollout as they see fit. Most recently, New Jersey opened up vaccinations to residents older than 65 and anyone 16 and up with underlying conditions. This expansion is in line with many other state\'s vaccination programs, but Gov. Phil Murphy has had to defend his choice to add smokers to the list of people who have a condition that grants them access to priority vaccination. This means New Jersey will be vaccinating smokers before essential workers. Keep reading for more on this state\'s vaccine rollout, and for more vaccine news, If You Take These OTC Meds, You Have to Stop Before Getting the Vaccine. New Jersey is expanding vaccination to people over 16 with underlying conditions. On Jan. 13, Murphy announced the addition of two new categories of residents that will be eligible to receive a COVID vaccine as soon as Jan. 14. The update includes senior citizens and anyone 16 and over "with certain medical conditions, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that increase the risk of severe illness from the virus."The state is targeting the people who have had the most severe reactions to COVID. "Expanding access to vaccine to individuals in these categories is critical as we know they are at greater risk for severe COVID-19 illness and death," New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli added in the statement. "Eighty percent of COVID-19 deaths in New Jersey have been among those 65 and older and overall 67 percent of deaths had one or more underlying conditions reported." And for more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter. There are several underlying conditions that qualify residents for vaccination, including being a smoker. According to Murphy\'s statement, the conditions that entitle you to vaccination in New Jersey during this phase include "cancer, chronic kidney disease, COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], Down Syndrome, heart conditions, obesity and severe obesity, sickle cell disease, smoking, and type 2 diabetes mellitus."Additionally, those who are pregnant or immunocompromised due to an organ transplant are also eligible for a vaccine now. However, the statement advised people in these positions to adhere to CDC guidance and discuss vaccination with their personal provider before sitting down for the shot. And for more on vaccine complications, Dr. Fauci Just Gave This Warning About COVID Vaccine Side Effects. Smokers can now get vaccinated in New Jersey before many essential workers. New Jersey expanded priority vaccination to include first responders such as police officers and firefighters on Jan. 6. However, Murphy skipped over vaccinating other essential workers, including teachers, restaurant workers, and grocery store staff. Now, smokers will be vaccinated ahead of these workers.During Murphy and Persichilli\'s press briefing, they defended their decision to include smokers. "Smoking puts you at significant risk for an adverse result from COVID-19, and there are 2 million smokers in New Jersey who fit into these categories," Persichilli said during the Jan. 13 briefing. And for more urgent vaccine information, discover The Only 2 People Who Shouldn\'t Get the COVID Vaccine, FDA Official Says. New Jersey has already been vaccinating other high-risk groups. The newest groups up for vaccination are joining the previous people in Phase 1A who were already eligible for the shot. New Jersey has been vaccinating healthcare personnel, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and first responders. Surprisingly, Persichilli said, "No documentation of the medical condition or your age will be required" at the time of the vaccination.

He added, "I’m very much looking forward to working with President Biden,” per the New York Times.  * On the call, however, Trudeau "raised Canada’s disappointment with the United States’ decision on the Keystone XL pipeline," according to the readout.  * "The Prime Minister underscored the important economic and energy security benefits of our bilateral energy relationship as well as his support for energy workers."The big picture: The pipeline project originally came with an $8 billion price tag and was expected to carry roughly 830,000 barrels of crude oil daily from Canada through Nebraska, per The Washington Post.  * Though President Obama rejected the pipeline, President Trump gave it the green light once in office.  * Lawsuits slowed construction on the project throughout Trump\'s administration.   * Two Native American communities sued the government over the pipeline last year, charging the government did not consult with tribes on the pipeline\'s proposed path, which crosses tribal lands.  * Its permit repeal is one of several "critical first steps to address the climate crisis, create good union jobs, and advance environmental justice, while reversing the previous administration’s harmful policies," according to the Biden administration.In their Friday call, the two leaders discussed collaborating on COVID vaccines and the flow of critical medical supplies, efforts to work with Indigenous people and plans to address climate change through cross-border clean electricity transmission and net-zero emissions.  * "Both leaders have made combating climate change, defending human rights and strengthening international institutions central to their platforms," the Times writes.  * "The leaders reiterated their firm commitment to multilateral institutions and alliance," per the readout.Flashback: In 2017, Trudeau touted the Keystone XL pipeline, saying: "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s top infectious diseases expert, on Sunday told CNN, "it\'s nothing like we\'ve ever been through in the last 102 years since the 1918 influenza pandemic... It really is a terrible situation that we\'ve been through. And that we\'re still going through."Case rates in the U.S. have declined markedly to their lowest levels since the Thanksgiving holidays. But Fauci told CNN, "We want to get that baseline really, really, really low before we start thinking that we\'re out of the woods." He said Americans may still need to wear masks in 2022. At the same time, prevention measures are being relaxed again, new variants of the virus are emerging, and just 15 percent of the U.S. has so far received a vaccination.The Centers for Disease Control on Sunday reported a little over sixty million Americans have gotten at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. About 19 million have received a second dose.President Joe Biden last week said he was confident the U.S. would have hundreds of millions of doses by summer."We will have ordered, much of which will have been distributed, over six hundred million doses by the end of July, July twenty ninth is the expected date.

{'_id': '38dc1a956dcfbe36e476f81a2176263e', 'title': 'A Dying Teacher, Worrying Over Students to His Last Breaths', 'description': 'Erick Ortiz lay in a hospital bed just before Thanksgiving, struggling to breathe. Unable to see his family, he texted his wife, concerned about his high school chemistry students: “Have they assigned a sub for my classes?” Four days later, he was put on a ventilator. He would never recover. Ortiz’s death last month after testing positive for the coronavirus devastated his family and colleagues at Charles H. Milby High School, which serves one of Houston’s poorest neighborhoods, and heightened concern among educators throughout the city about in-person teaching during the pandemic. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “I don’t want this to ever happen to another teacher,” said Maria Ortiz, Erick Ortiz’s widow, who retired from teaching in 2019. “They have to be protected as well.” There is no indication that teachers are dying at a higher rate than other professionals, and no evidence that the coronavirus is spreading faster in schools than in communities at large, especially in districts where health precautions are strictly followed. Federal researchers said Tuesday that they had found “little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission” in places that take safety seriously. But the special role that teachers play in their communities, through their connection with children and families, and the concern among educators about the safety of in-person teaching has made the losses especially painful and disruptive in many places. “There are educators that are dying and have died from this,” said Daniel Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, which represents 9,000 superintendents across the country. “When that happens, that makes the situation even harder to try to convince others to move ahead.” Though there is no definitive account of how many of the nation’s 3.5 million teachers have died during the pandemic, the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation’s largest teachers’ unions, said it was aware of 530 school employees lost to COVID-19 last year. The Houston Independent School District, like many across the country, said that it had taken the kind of steps recommended by public health officials, including a mask mandate, social distancing and Plexiglas barriers in classrooms. But many educators said those rules were not strictly enforced, and the precautions were inadequate or unevenly applied. Domenech said school superintendents find themselves trying to balance teacher safety concerns with the need for in-person learning, to combat the many inequities of remote schooling. “They will always be under fire from the teachers who feel that they’re being forced to go into a situation that they don’t think is safe,” he said, “and from parents who either want their kids in or out.” Educators lost to the virus in recent weeks include a married couple who taught at public schools in Grand Prairie, Texas, and died within hours of each other; an art teacher in Fayetteville, North Carolina, whose students left her personal messages on a memorial outside the school; and a gym teacher and coach in Lincoln County, North Carolina, whose family hung a Nerf basketball hoop off the TV in his hospital room to try to distract him as he lay dying. The lack of contact tracing in most of the country, as well as the rapid spread of the virus throughout much of the United States in recent months, makes it nearly impossible to know where most of those teachers contracted the virus. But their deaths have still contributed to the heated debates in communities over school safety. The death of Patrick Key, an elementary schoolteacher in Powder Springs, Georgia, who lost a monthlong battle with COVID-19 on Christmas morning, intensified pressure to halt in-person learning in Cobb County’s school district. After two other district teachers died last week, more than a hundred educators showed up for a protest ahead of a school board meeting. Two board members and the superintendent declined a request to wear masks during a moment of silence to honor Key, whose obituary asked that in lieu of sending flowers for his funeral, people buy and wear face coverings. In Montgomery, Alabama, the deaths of at least four school employees who had been battling the virus have added to the sense of alarm. The most recent was a 49-year-old music teacher. On Monday, the superintendent announced that Montgomery schools would move to remote classes and most likely resume in-person instruction only once vaccines are available for the district’s 4,500 employees. Some states have prioritized educators for vaccinations, but not all. And even in places where teachers are near the front of the line, officials say it could take months to vaccinate everyone who works in schools. Even then, many teachers remain concerned about returning to classrooms as new, apparently more contagious variants arise. Ortiz’s death in December had a galvanizing effect on educators in Houston. The following week, teachers at about 50 schools in Harris County participated in a nationwide sickout to demand a safer learning environment during the pandemic. “He could have been me,” said Traci Latson, 50, a teacher at Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School, who described in-person instruction in Houston as “Russian roulette.” Ortiz’s death prompted her to get her will and financial affairs in order, she said. “Every day that I step on campus,” Latson said, “I’m not quite sure if it’s my last day.” Under Texas law, teachers and their unions lack collective bargaining power, unlike in many Northern states, where some teachers and their unions have resisted returning to classrooms because of concerns about their safety. In Chicago, tensions over reopening plans have escalated to the point where the district told parents not to send their children to school on Wednesday because teachers there refused to come to work in person and may strike. Public health experts have largely come to agree that schools, particularly elementary schools, are unlikely to seed transmission of the virus when community spread is low — provided those schools use mitigation strategies. That thinking was bolstered again Tuesday by a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which looked at 17 schools in rural Wisconsin where mask wearing was common; it found that of 191 infections among staff members and students during the fall, seven resulted from in-school transmission. In Houston, which like all Texas school districts was required by the state to offer an in-person teaching option last fall, the school system has a mask mandate and requires 6 feet of social distancing “whenever possible.” A district spokesperson said it also set up daily temperature checks at school entrances, plexiglass dividers in classrooms and nasal swab testing on campus — though several teachers disputed the ubiquity of those practices. One teacher provided pictures of what she considered the inadequate dividers in her classroom — there are two, one for her desk, and a second one that can be moved between student desks — while others said there was no routine testing in their particular schools, despite district policy, and that they knew of students who had coronavirus cases in their families, and even deaths, but came to school with symptoms anyway. The Houston school district is the nation’s seventh largest, with about 200,000 students and more than 27,000 employees. As of Monday, it had reported 2,181 confirmed coronavirus cases during the pandemic, including 1,199 among staff members, or about 4% of employees. Ortiz, a 52-year-old father of three who had diabetes, was wary about returning to the classroom, his wife said. A lover of science, he studied biology in college and worked in a lab before becoming a high school teacher in 1997, a career shift inspired by his wife. “I kind of talked him into it because I loved it, and he ended up loving it, too,” Maria Ortiz said. Her husband wore a plastic face shield and a mask in his chemistry classes after schools opened in October. Ortiz said she believed he became infected with the virus later that month while proctoring the SAT for five hours, in a classroom with about 20 students. She recalled him mentioning that some of the students were coughing during the test. About a week later, he came home feeling under the weather, she said, and tested positive for the virus. For the next week, he stayed behind the closed door of their bedroom, ill with a fever that hit 104 degrees and an increasingly severe cough. Early on Nov. 16, Maria Ortiz went to check on him, she said, and found he could not speak. She called an ambulance. “They didn’t even tell me what his oxygen was; they just said it’s really low, we need to take him to the hospital,” she recalled. “He never came out.” In an email, the Houston school system said that it had been “deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our beloved Milby High School teachers,” but said the district “remains focused on providing our students with a high-quality education while ensuring that the health, safety and well-being of both our students and staff are held to the highest standard.” For Ortiz and her children, the loss has been devastating. “Dad was everything to them,” she said. She also received messages from some of her husband’s former students, including letters that were delivered to the funeral home. “He was one of the most caring and hardworking people I’ve met,” one student wrote. Her grief is mixed with anger, because she believes the welfare of her husband and his colleagues was not prioritized. “Teachers are also on the front lines educating children, trying to get them ahead, during this pandemic,” Ortiz said. “And they’re not being treated with respect.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'ae6ec7447974ee4961cccb001a799cd6', 'title': 'Racial Divide in Reopened Classrooms: More White Than Black Children', 'description': 'NEW YORK -- Mayor Bill de Blasio\'s monthslong effort to reopen New York City classrooms was complicated by major logistical challenges, staunch political resistance and a series of crises that culminated in a brief systemwide shutdown last month. At every turn, de Blasio insisted that the city\'s most vulnerable children needed open schools.But as some school buildings reopen this week, the mayor has found himself presiding over a starkly unequal school system in which many white families have flocked back to classrooms while most families of color have chosen to learn from home indefinitely.That gulf is illustrated in a startling statistic: There are nearly 12,000 more white children returning to public school buildings than Black students -- even though there are many more Black students than white children in the system overall.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIn New York and across the country, politicians and education officials have found that many nonwhite families are not ready to send their children back to classrooms -- despite their struggles with remote learning -- in part because of the disproportionately harsh impact the virus has had on their communities.But the fact that so many students of color have chosen remote over in-person learning is raising alarms that existing disparities in the nation\'s largest school system will widen, since remote learning has been far less effective, parents, educators and officials said in dozens of interviews. More than ever, they say, the city must quickly bolster online instruction -- or risk having its neediest children fall irrevocably behind."It\'s the perfect storm of marginalization," said Jamila Newman of TNTP, a nonprofit that provides consulting services for districts on staffing and instruction. "That\'s why there is the need to demand stronger instruction remotely."New York\'s issues with remote instruction begin with a lack of basic infrastructure for students learning from home. Many low-income students, including some living in homeless shelters, cannot even log on for classes because they still do not have devices or Wi-Fi.Educators also said they were scrambling to make lessons more engaging for students without much helpful guidance from the city. So while individual teachers and schools have honed creative strategies to improve online instruction, there is no clear citywide plan to do the same, leaving a patchwork system of learning across the city\'s 1,800 schools.De Blasio has acknowledged that his administration spent much of its time and resources focused on physically reopening classrooms, rather than on improving remote learning, precisely because it understood that in-person learning is generally superior.But the shortcomings of that strategy are now becoming clear in the demographic breakdown of the roughly 190,000 children returning to classrooms this week.Of the roughly 1 million students who attend traditional public schools, about 700,000 have chosen to learn from home, and another 110,000 middle and high school students who signed up for in-person classes but cannot yet return to school buildings.Latino students make up the largest share of students returning to classrooms, about 43%, roughly proportional to their overall representation in the school system. But white children, who are less likely to be low income than many of their peers, make up a quarter of students back in classrooms, even though they represent just 16% of overall enrollment, the smallest percentage of any racial group.Black and Asian American families are significantly underrepresented in reopened classrooms. Just under 18% of Black families have chosen to send their children back to school, though those students make up nearly a quarter of the system. Asian American children, who represent about 18% of the overall school system, make up the smallest share of children in classrooms this week, at just under 12%.Still, about three-quarters of children returning to schools are nonwhite, in part because the system is overwhelmingly Black and Latino.There is no one reason the numbers are so skewed. Families of all racial and ethnic groups in New York have decided to return to classrooms or stay home based on individual circumstances. But the data and interviews with parents show that Black and Asian American families in particular did not trust the city to keep their children safe."Clearly, there are Black families who are hesitant, which only makes sense after the disparities they experienced during the heights of the pandemic," Bill Neidhardt, the mayor\'s press secretary, said in a statement. "And that\'s exactly why our vaccine response will focus on equity and engaging the hardest-hit communities, so we can get our schools fully back once and for all."Experts and advocates said more nonwhite students might have chosen to attend classes in person if the city had done a better job of outreach.In some cases, just the opposite happened: Even while de Blasio was trumpeting open classrooms, some schools were asking every family that was able to stay at home to do so, in order to ease staffing and scheduling burdens.But those who chose online learning said they needed more support from the Department of Education."I feel like the city treats remote like an afterthought," said Erika Kendall, a Black parent in Brooklyn whose two children decided to learn from home this year.About 60,000 students learning remotely still had not received the devices they requested as of a few weeks ago, which has spurred some parents to crowdfund laptops for children who need them. The Legal Aid Society recently sued the city for not providing Wi-Fi in all city shelters so that children can attend school remotely.City officials said they would distribute devices to all children who need them in the coming weeks and noted that they have given iPads with data from multiple service providers to some children living in shelters.Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, pointed to resources the city had provided to improve remote learning: for example, expanded technical support for teachers and families and more training for educators, including a master class for using Google Classroom and more help from remote learning specialists."We have transformed the nation\'s largest school system in a matter of months, and we\'ve never strayed from our commitment and focus on making remote learning the strongest it could be," she said in a statement. "In a system as large as ours, educators come into teaching with varying skills, and there can never be a one-size-fits-all approach."Still, many families said the city\'s efforts have been seriously lacking, particularly for the children who struggle most with remote learning.Jenn Choi, a parent and activist for children with disabilities, said a recent survey she helped conduct of over 1,000 city parents of children with special needs left her extremely discouraged about the quality of pandemic-era schooling. "Instruction has been spread so thin to the point where it can\'t even count as special education instruction," she said.De Blasio has continued to defend his focus on reopening classrooms."We\'ve always said from the beginning that nothing is as good as in-person education," the mayor said at a recent news conference, adding that he believes a vaccine will be more widely distributed in the spring, allowing more students to return to school. On Monday, the mayor said his team is working on a plan to address learning loss for whenever all students are back in school full time.The demographics of the pandemic-era school system do not resemble what the mayor hoped and expected. But entrenched inequities in New York City\'s public schools far precede his administration or the pandemic. And the mayor\'s effort to reopen schools for as many children as possible is one of the most ambitious initiatives undertaken by any mayor in years.The city has faced particular challenges because of its vast size and the spotlight that has been fixed on it. The second- and third-largest school districts, Los Angeles and Chicago, still have not attempted to reopen their public schools.The scale of need among the city\'s public school students is also unmatched anywhere else in the country, making reopening even more challenging: The vast majority of New York City students are low income and nonwhite, and the city is home to about 111,000 homeless students as well as 200,000 children with disabilities.City officials described a series of conversations over the summer in which they tried to determine if one vulnerable group or another should get priority for classroom instruction, but the exercise stalled when they found that the vast majority of students were at risk.Asked recently what the city was doing to improve online learning for those students, the schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, said, "It\'s not sexy-sounding; it\'s not big newsworthy, but we\'re actually taking what teachers are doing and sharing those best practices with other teachers."Indeed, teachers and principals said they had largely been left to their own devices.Elsa Gilheany, a kindergarten teacher in the Bronx, spends many mornings tying her laundry bag around her shoulders to resemble a cape, in order to transform into what she calls a reading superhero. She kicks off a round of "pointer power," in which her students point to a word on their screen and sound it out, and "snap power," when children are asked to quickly identify words.But even with engaged students and parents, Gilheany said, "It\'s so much harder to do this through a computer, as opposed to a child being able to physically touch a book."Nikki Cistac, a high school English teacher in Manhattan, has sent copies of "The Great Gatsby" in Spanish to students\' parents who do not speak English at home, so they can follow along with their children. She asked students to create a playlist of their favorite songs, which Cistac lip-syncs on camera as students log into class.Now, she said, "kids are rarely late."Teachers across the city said they had learned to appreciate breakthroughs in virtual learning. For Matt Baker, a high school math teacher in Brooklyn, that moment came a few weeks ago, when his students starting singing along to a tune intended to help them memorize the quadratic formula.But those victories can feel all too rare."It\'s hard to get a good gauge on whether what you\'re doing is working," Baker said. "You kind of put it all out there. It\'s a lot of hoping."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '057cf6270dce14a41aa7a986d9f28ca5', 'title': "Biden, Calling Stimulus Bill a 'Down Payment,' Urges More Relief", 'description': 'WILMINGTON, Del. -- A day after Congress approved a hard-fought $900 billion stimulus package, President-elect Joe Biden called the measure a "down payment" Tuesday and vowed to enter office next month asking lawmakers to return to the negotiating table."Congress did its job this week," he said, "and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year."In a year-end news conference in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden remained vague about the specifics of his plan. But he appeared to be laying the groundwork for how he will handle the country\'s economic recovery, signaling that another major economic relief package would be a priority.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBiden said he planned to ask Congress to pass another bill that would include more funding to help firefighters, police officers and nurses. He said that his bill would include a new round of stimulus checks to Americans but that the amount of money they contained would be a matter of negotiation.His focus, he said, was to have the money necessary to distribute vaccines to 300 million people, to support Americans who have lost jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic and to help businesses stay open."People are desperately hurting," he said.President Donald Trump also responded to the bill Tuesday, hours after Biden\'s news conference. In a video he posted on Twitter, Trump read from a prepared statement and complained about the legislation his advisers had said he would sign. "I\'m asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple," he said, calling the bill "a disgrace.""It\'s called the COVID relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID," he said, noting that it included funding for the Egyptian military; money for countries like Honduras and Nicaragua; and support for the Kennedy Center in Washington.If Trump chooses not to immediately sign the bill, the government will still be funded through Monday, and Republicans have enough votes that they could override a potential veto. But the checks that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said would go out next week could be delayed.This month, when Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tried to unanimously force legislation that would provide larger direct payments of $1,200, a staunch Trump ally, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, blocked the endeavor.The $900 billion package Congress approved Monday would provide billions of dollars for the distribution of vaccines and support for small businesses, schools and cultural institutions.It would also allocate a round of $600 direct payments to millions of American adults and children, as well as support a series of expanded and extended unemployment benefits for 11 weeks. Those programs will taper off, potentially prompting some form of congressional action before then."I think everybody understands that Vice President Biden is going to ask for another bill, so we will have another chance to revisit it probably pretty soon," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters Monday.Biden did not negotiate with lawmakers on the stimulus directly, but his incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain, and other officials tapped to be part of the administration were kept abreast of the hour-by-hour developments in the talks, according to Democratic officials familiar with the situation.Behind the scenes, Biden quietly pushed for lawmakers to strike a compromise that would deliver at least some modest help after months of congressional inaction. He has lavished praise on the bipartisan group of moderate lawmakers who crafted a framework over weeks of video calls, texts and huddles on Capitol Hill, helping prod leadership out of a monthslong impasse and inspiring a flurry of last-ditch negotiations.At a November meeting in Wilmington with the top two congressional Democrats -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader -- the three leaders discussed their shared agenda, the deep policy divisions with Republicans and the additional work they planned to pursue come January.And in drastically lowering their demands for another multitrillion-dollar package, Democrats cited the surprise success of initial vaccine trials, Biden\'s victory in the election and his promise to pursue another relief package in January as part of their reason for doing so."Joe Biden calling this a first step, a down payment -- we knew that we would revisit it, and we would have a better chance with a Democratic president who cared about science," Pelosi said in an interview, adding that "we\'ll have presidential leadership."But the discussions about another relief package will pose an initial test of Biden\'s approach to working with Congress, and his optimism about the prospects of bipartisan legislating in an intensely polarized era. With just under a month until the inauguration, he still does not know what the balance of power will be in Congress when he assumes office, and House Democrats face a significantly smaller majority in 2021.Even if Democrats win both runoff elections for Georgia\'s Senate seats Jan. 5 and gain control of the chamber, current Senate rules will require some Republican support to ensure that legislation clears the chamber. If Republicans hold on to at least one of those seats, Biden will be left contending with a Republican Senate majority.In pursuing another package, he will also face the prospect of wrangling an elusive compromise on two of the thorniest policy provisions: a direct stream of funding for state and local governments, which he has repeatedly voiced support for, and a Republican demand for a sweeping liability shield from COVID-related lawsuits for businesses, schools and other institutions. With both sides so dug in on the two issues over about eight months of debate, congressional leaders ultimately agreed to remove both provisions from the final $900 billion agreement.Republicans on Capitol Hill have begun to tacitly acknowledge Biden\'s public desire for another package. But after spending more than $3 trillion this year to help the economy and struggling families, businesses and institutions, several Republicans are resistant to another sweeping package at the start of 2021."If we address the critical needs right now, and things improve next year as the vaccine gets out there and the economy starts to pick up again, you know, then maybe there\'s less of a need," Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters last week before the deal was reached.Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has declined to commit to pursuing another round of relief, although he did not rule out another round of negotiations."I\'m happy to evaluate that based on the needs that we confront in February and March," McConnell told reporters on a press call Monday. "I don\'t rule it out or rule it in."Throughout his campaign, Biden emphasized the importance of building consensus between the two parties -- a mindset that some Democrats have dismissed as unrealistic.But Biden, who spent 36 years as a senator from Delaware, continues to express confidence in how Republicans will work with him. He noted on Tuesday that he had faced criticism about "how naive I am about how the Congress works.""I think I\'ve been proven right across the board," the president-elect said.Biden reiterated that he believed that Trump\'s departure of from the White House would alter the political dynamics in Washington. "I think with Donald Trump not in the way, that will also enhance the prospect of things getting done," he said.Biden has plenty of experience watching new presidents try to advance their goals on Capitol Hill, and he was asked Tuesday whether he thought he would have a honeymoon period to accomplish his aims."I don\'t think it\'s a honeymoon at all," he responded. "I think it\'s a nightmare that everybody\'s going through, and they all say it\'s got to end."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

It is often eerily quiet, and when no customers come by, Lee at times sits at her work station and weeps."Maybe, just maybe, tomorrow will be busy," she said. "I\'m waiting."Like nail salons across New York City, her business had to close when the pandemic hit in March. There was a brief surge in demand after the lockdown was lifted in July, but then appointments started dwindling. Often, customers requested cheaper services. Now, they hardly come at all.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe beauty industry in the city seemed well positioned to bounce back after restrictions ended. After all, many customers had spent months without professional grooming. But now, many of these businesses are on the verge of collapse -- a drastic hit for an industry that is an economic engine for immigrant women.Some nail salons have had a difficult time persuading customers that it is safe to come in. Others, especially those in Manhattan business districts, have yet to see regular customers come back because many of them had left the city or are working from home.With 26 years of nail salon experience and 20 years of savings poured into her own business, Lee, 53, said there was nothing else that she can imagine doing. But she\'s barely staying afloat."Even though it was hard before, I was always able to pay the bills. But now, no matter how hard I work, I make no money," she said.Nail salon visits in the state have dropped by more than 50%, and sales have fallen by more than 40%, according to an October survey of 161 salon owners conducted by the Nail Industry Federation of New York.The New York Nail Salon Workers Association, an advocacy group affiliated with the union Workers United, said less than half of 594 workers surveyed had returned to work as of August. In New York City, there were 4,240 nail salons in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Three percent of the country\'s nail salons are in Brooklyn, and 2% are in Queens."The workforce is primarily immigrant workers living paycheck to paycheck, supporting children and in many cases sick and aging family members in their own countries," said Luis Gomez, the association\'s organizing director. "Add the recession and the effects of the pandemic on top, and we anticipate that many workers will fall even deeper into poverty."In Queens, Rambika Ulak KC, 50, said she had so much business shortly after reopening in July that she hired back all 10 of her employees part time. But now, she sees only about four customers a day.Ulak dropped out of college in Nepal to come to the United States. When she developed carpal tunnel from giving manicures or was berated by customers frustrated by her poor English, she would fix her eyes on the photos of her daughter taped to the wall. Now, as her business erodes, she finds herself looking back at the photos even more often."That\'s why I work so hard," Ulak said. "So I can tell her, \'Don\'t think of my future, just be happy and focus on your studies.\'"Salons were able to reopen in July at 50% capacity, with waiting rooms banned and walk-ins discouraged.While indoor services pose more risks for virus transmission, Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that if everyone wears masks and customers are properly social distancing, they\'re "somewhat safer than with indoor dining."Still, many industry leaders worry that salons won\'t be able to win back customers\' full confidence and subsequently recover until a vaccine is in wide use.Eighty-one percent of the national nail salon workforce are women while 79% are foreign-born, according to a 2018 report conducted by the UCLA Labor Center.Older women may have less career flexibility should the industry continue to crater, said Prarthana Gurung, campaign manager at Adhikaar, a Nepali work center that assists nearly 1,300 Nepali-speaking salon workers in New York City."There is a subset of women who\'ve been in the nail salon industry for decades, and this is it regardless of what happens," Gurung said.Hannah Lee, 60, is one of those women: Since she arrived in the United States, she has worked only in nail salons. Lee reluctantly left South Korea after her husband persuaded her there would be better jobs here, she said.Though she missed South Korea, she didn\'t complain -- as a salon worker, Lee learned English on the job, saved enough to put her son through college and always paid her rent on time.Even now, Lee recognizes she is lucky to be hired back at salons in Queens and Manhattan, where she worked before the pandemic. But she said both salons rarely have any customers these days. She often receives only a few dollars in tips, sometimes nothing at all.Her pay plummeted from $1,000 per week to $300. She\'s behind on rent and is barely able to afford groceries, she said. But she said she refused to look into other industries and is on the hunt for a third nail salon gig despite her worries about her health."I just want to feel comfortable with my life. I don\'t want anxiety when I go to work about whether customers will come today or not, whether I will get the virus today or not," she said in Korean.In Jackson Heights, Queens, Mariwvey Ramirez, 38, recently went back to work after being furloughed for a second time at the Rego Park salon where she worked because of the neighborhood closures.The first time, back in March, was financially devastating for Ramirez, who is undocumented and therefore ineligible to collect unemployment. Even now, Ramirez, a single mother, was only hired back part time. Her wages went from $700 a week to $400.Ramirez moved to the United States from Mexico 18 years ago to be with her brother, who moved to the country first, and worked in the salon industry for 17 years."I don\'t know how to do anything else, for all these years, I worked in nail salons -- really my whole life," she said in Spanish.The only silver lining has been that now that she has free time, she has enrolled in a class to learn English -- in part to broaden her job opportunities, but mostly to advance in the nail salon industry once the pandemic subsides.Juyoung Lee, the owner of the Beverly Nail Studio, moved from South Korea to New York City 30 years ago. When she arrived, she could only find work in the dry cleaning, garment and nail salon industries because of her limited English.She first landed a job at a sewing factory, but a few years later, it closed down. She tried her luck in the nail business, saving up for more than two decades to open up her own salon.When Lee first toured the vacant storefront that would become her salon in 2014, the real estate agent told her he couldn\'t imagine the worn-down space turning into a nail shop, she recalled. But Lee could see it -- the pink walls, a row of plush pedicure chairs, a collection of nail polish in every conceivable color."This was my dream," Lee said. "Really, this is every employee\'s dream to open up their own salon."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

She uses a walker and has a chronic lung disease. She is exactly the kind of person who most needs a coronavirus vaccine. And yet, she has found it impossible to make an appointment and has become lost in the confusing system set up by the city and the state. Computer-literate, she navigated New York City’s vaccine finder page Monday, found the closest provider and sent an email with her name and number to set up an appointment. When no one called, she reached out to the urgent care’s corporate office, which told her to wait. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times She wanted to register at the new Javits Convention Center megasite, which she heard about on the news, but couldn’t figure out how. “I’m willing to wait my turn,” she said, frustrated, “but I would like to have some feeling that I have a turn.” In the city, over 1 million older New Yorkers started the week with optimism that they would finally gain access to the vaccine after months of fearing they would fall victim to the coronavirus. But the reality of actually getting the shots has proved to be far more maddening. Buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems that act in parallel but do not link together and a lack of outreach are causing exasperation and exhaustion among older New Yorkers and others trying to set up vaccination appointments. It is also stymying New York’s early efforts to get the vaccine to many of the city’s most vulnerable, creating a situation that elected officials say risks exacerbating the inequalities that COVID-19 has already laid painfully bare. The race to vaccinate millions of New Yorkers has reached a critical point, as officials Wednesday announced that two cases of a more contagious British variant of the virus had been detected in New York City, one in Manhattan and one in Queens. The state has used 35% of its available vaccine, in line with the national average in a rollout that has gone far slower than expected nationwide. New York City has distributed 38% of its shots, with 491,000 available doses as of Thursday. But in the race to get shots in arms, some say the bigger picture about exactly whose arms should be prioritized has been lost. “Here we are, facing a global pandemic, with thousands of New Yorkers who have lost their lives, and who is again the forgotten group of people? The very people who need help the most,” said Mark Treyger, a city councilman from Brooklyn who said his office had been inundated with calls from family members trying to get appointments for their parents. In New York City, more than 2 million residents now qualify for the vaccine, including over 1 million people older than 65 who became eligible this week. The city’s vaccine supply varies, with about 100,000 doses coming this week from the federal government, although some weeks it has received double that amount. Even as the city and state rush to stand up a huge distribution network, there are increasing worries about supply, with essential workers — including teachers, police officers, transit workers and grocery store clerks — and people older than 65 racing to make appointments. About 26,000 shots per day are now being administered in the city. “Right now, if we don’t get more vaccine, there literally will not be appointments available after the next couple of weeks,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a Wednesday news conference. He called the frustrating sign-up system a smaller problem by comparison. On Thursday, the main New York state website posted an all-caps alert, blaming the federal government for not sending enough shots for the 7 million New Yorkers now eligible and saying all appointments at state-run sites were booked for the next 14 weeks. Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez, the city's commissioner for the Department for the Aging, said 290 participant organizations were making 60,000 calls per week to older adults to let them know about the vaccine and help them schedule visits. The problem, people who work in senior services say, is that these systems were not sufficiently organized ahead of time. Allison Nickerson, executive director of LiveOn NY, an advocacy organization for older New Yorkers, said that she had been asked to participate in a task force on rolling out the vaccine to those older than 75, but it hadn’t met yet. Several nonprofit social service organizations said that save for being given a script to read to people on a phone call, and a link to the same vaccine finder map that Engle was struggling with, they hadn’t been consulted. The city announced Thursday a new program to vaccinate seniors who live in public housing, beginning with the opening of three clinics in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island. “There is a big aging services network whose remit is to reach the poorest, oldest, least capacitated people,” said Ruth Finkelstein, executive director of the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging at Hunter College. “But those agencies have not been central to the distribution strategy.” In Jackson Heights, Roseline David, 80, a retired auditor, said she had been trying to get vaccination appointments for herself and her husband since Monday. She sent repeated messages to her regular doctor. She spent hours on the city’s website Tuesday night, painstakingly filling out forms, only to find out at the end that there was no availability and she had to cancel out of the system. She called 311 and is waiting for a call back. “I’ve spent about 18 to 19 hours so far,” she said Wednesday. “I call this harassment. It affects my mental ability to do other things. And this is only for the first shot; who knows when the second shot is coming?” Along with older New Yorkers, people who speak languages other than English are also disadvantaged, as well as those who cannot use a computer, Treyger and others said. There is a phone hotline, but hold times can be long. A key issue is the disconnect between the city and the state’s systems for setting up appointments, which is leading to confusion on the ground. At Hillcrest High School in Queens on Wednesday, a vaccination hub run by the city, a handful of people who had signed up via the state’s website were told by health department staff that they were in the wrong place and would have to go to a community health center located in a former firehouse about a half mile away. Struggling with their phones, a few people failed to produce their appointment identification numbers for health workers, or a corresponding QR code that would confirm their appointments. Staff in blue vests helped sort out the confusion and, in some cases, scheduled appointments for people who thought they had already scheduled them. “Some people don’t even have computers,” said Hilary Umans, who had brought her mother, Priscilla, for her vaccine. “What if you don’t have a smartphone? And what if you’re not a native English speaker?” Dave Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said at a City Council oversight hearing Tuesday that to some extent, the separate sign-up systems cannot be helped: Each major player in the effort has separate medical records systems that vaccination schedules must link to. Each participating urgent care also has its own scheduling system, as do Costco, Rite Aid and dozens of other providers. The city is trying to streamline the sign-up system to make it simpler, he said. But it has not yet announced how it will tackle the other huge challenges of how to get frail adults without transportation safely to vaccine appointments, and how to reach the city’s tens of thousands of homebound older New Yorkers. “We have to ensure that the experience, particularly for our elders, including frail elders, is as easy as possible,” Chokshi said. For now, many older adults are getting help from friends and relatives, but even that is no guarantee of success. In Riverdale, in the Bronx, Annette Gaudino, who works as policy director for a health advocacy organization, had been trying to register her 95-year-old mother for two days, checking multiple locations. She was not sure if she would be allowed to accompany her to the appointment. “My mom is increasingly confused, needs a walker and has a part-time home care aide who also needs vaccination,” she said. “There’s got to be a better way.” Joan Jeffri, 76, who lives in Midwood, Brooklyn — and who was frustrated after being confirmed for an urgent care appointment only to be told later that they had no vaccine — sent a letter to Gov. Andrew Cuomo alerting him to the problems. The lightest moment in her last few days, she said, was when she clicked on the link to her local Rite Aid through the city’s website, only to be told there were 11,624 people waiting to enter the website in front of her. “I burst out laughing,” she said. Her daughter-in-law finally got her an appointment at a city site after two hours of effort, and she goes for her shot in two weeks. “Everyone I speak to is insanely and completely frustrated,” Jeffri said, “and has spent between two and eight hours or more trying to get through.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company", 'num_of_covid': 1}

But drug industry leaders have decided the event is more of a "public relations stunt," and some big names aren\'t even planning to attend, Stat News reports.Pfizer and Moderna are currently at the top of the COVID-19 vaccine world, having produced vaccine candidates that are more than 90 percent effective at stopping transmission of the disease. But despite the fact that both of the companies\' CEOs had been invited to the vaccine summit, neither plans to attend, two sources tell Stat. The summit comes just days before the Food and Drug Administration is set to examine Pfizer\'s vaccine data, and a week before it will look at Moderna\'s. Both reviews will likely result in emergency use authorizations for the two vaccines.Many other companies involved in the vaccine distribution process — FedEx, UPS, Walgreens, and CVS among them — are expected to send representatives to the event. But they "are likely to send lower-ranking executives as opposed to their CEOs," sources familiar with the event\'s planning tell Stat. And despite an apparent conflict of interest, Peter Marks, the FDA official who heads vaccine approvals, may end up attending the summit, Stat reports.More stories from theweek.com  The post-Mitch McConnell GOP is going to be a carnival of madness  Would Republicans believe election conspiracy theories without Trump?

Now, with the mutant coronavirus variant fueling a near vertical spike in new daily cases, huge parts of the country are starting the new year by being slammed back into the harshest of lockdowns.The speed of the turnaround has been astonishing and terrifying. At the end of November, following a nationwide lockdown in England, Britain’s case numbers had declined to around 13,000 a day. Now the country has recorded more than 50,000 cases for six days in a row. The message to the world appears to be clear—the new variant spreads faster, and, without strict preventative measures, this will happen to you too.> The UK’s Covid-19 curve is now almost vertical. pic.twitter.com/ZtRCJRDzwA> > — George Eaton (@georgeeaton) January 3, 2021Britain’s surge comes despite the planned Christmas relaxation being scrapped, schools closing down for Christmas, and the biggest city, London, being in the top tier of lockdown for two weeks. Experts have been warning for weeks that the new variant spreads so quickly that rules that may have worked last year are no longer enough. Political leaders are now scrambling to find how to knock it back, or face catastrophe.Scotland went first. Its devolved nationalist government had already closed the border to England after Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the new variant was running wild down south. On Monday, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced a lockdown every bit as strict as the one in spring. Her message: Stay at home, and keep your kids out of school, or we’ll end up as screwed as England.Sturgeon has estimated that Scotland is now about four weeks behind England’s surge, but the new rules—which force Scots by law not to leave their homes except for a few essential purposes—are designed to prevent the country from spiraling out of control like its neighbors. Scotland is recording 188.3 cases per 100,000, less than half the rate of England over the past seven days, according to government figures.Meanwhile, Johnson has been under intense pressure for prevaricating while cases in England have seen spike upon spike upon spike. That came to an end on Monday evening, with the prime minister announcing a new lockdown in an address to the nation. Most schools will be closed and citizens must stay at home except to buy necessities or exercise until at least mid-February, he said.Asked what was taking him so long to do something, Johnson said: “What we have been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier four measures on the virus and it is a bit unclear, still, at the moment. But if you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted that the rules that had worked since spring’s lockdown are “no longer strong enough.”Even more worryingly, though, is Hancock’s belief that the new British variant may not even be the biggest threat facing an already engulfed nation. He said Monday that he’s “incredibly worried” about a South African variant that has been deemed even more transmissible than the British one—and two cases of it have been confirmed in Britain.Hancock told the BBC on Monday: “This is a very, very significant problem... even more of a problem than the U.K. new variant.”One reason for that concern may be that British experts have openly queried whether the current vaccines will work on the South African mutant. John Bell, a University of Oxford professor and government vaccine adviser, has said there’s a “big question mark” as to whether the existing vaccines will work on the South African variant.It’s clear that Britain is in a bad situation—what’s much less clear is if this is as bad as it will get, if new measures will be enough to control the virus mutant, and what happens if an even worse one takes hold.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

None have been set aside for South Africa.The country, which will help manufacture the vaccine and whose citizens have enrolled in clinical trials, does not expect to see the first trickle of doses until around the middle of next year. By then, the United States, Britain and Canada, which have already started, may have vaccinated more than 100 million people.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe first year of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a country\'s wealth would not spare it from the virus. Overconfidence, poor planning and ignored warnings felled some of the world\'s richest nations. But now, money is translating into undeniable advantages.Over the past few months, rich nations like the United States and Britain have cut deals with multiple drug manufacturers and secured enough doses to vaccinate their citizens many times over. China and Russia have conducted their own trials and begun mass vaccination programs.Yet countries like South Africa are in a singular bind because they cannot hold out hope for charity. Although its government is nearly insolvent and half of its citizens live in poverty, South Africa is considered too rich to qualify for cut-rate vaccines from international aid organizations."Where you\'re not rich enough but you\'re not poor enough, you\'re stuck," said Salim Abdool Karim, a public health researcher who leads the country\'s coronavirus advisory council.Poor and middle-income nations, largely unable to compete in the open market, rely on a complex vaccine sharing scheme called Covax. A collaboration of international health organizations, Covax was designed to avoid the inequities of a free-market free-for-all. But its deals come with strings attached, and health advocates are questioning its transparency and accountability.By the middle of next year, South African officials hope to secure their first vaccine doses under Covax, even as they negotiate to buy supplemental supplies from drug manufacturers. But in a country where luxury estates are walled off from sprawling squatter villages, many expect the newest vaccines to remain a privilege for residents who can pay out of pocket or through supplemental insurance -- a program that disproportionately benefits white people."You\'ll be able to stride into your local private pharmacy and pay a couple hundred rand (about $15) and say, \'Hit me baby,\'" said Francois Venter, a researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\'Maybe We\'ll Get the Vaccine in 2025\'The best chance that many South Africans have to get vaccinated anytime soon is to volunteer for a clinical trial and test unproven vaccines on their bodies. But that arrangement has raised ethical questions.First is whether countries like South Africa, which is supporting trials by four drugmakers, should be guaranteed doses if the trials succeed. The government hasn\'t received such a guarantee. And at any rate, such an arrangement would be ethically murky, since it would punish countries that participate in unsuccessful trials.This month, as Britain prepared to begin its vaccination campaign, dozens of people walked from their shacks in Masiphumelele township, south of Cape Town, to the gates of the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation.They waited outside for hours, under the shade of a gum tree, for a chance to enroll in a clinical trial of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine."The people at the top, they\'re going to get the vaccine, the people who have power," said Mtshaba Mzwamadoda, 42, who lives in a one-bedroom corrugated metal shack with his wife and three children. "Maybe we\'ll get the vaccine in 2025.""We\'ll all be dead then," said Prudence Nonzamedyantyi, 46, a housekeeper from the same township."That\'s why we signed up," Mzwamadoda said. "This is the only chance I have."Katherine Gill, an AIDS researcher who is leading the trial, usually tempers her enthusiasm for such tests. But early results from other drugmakers have been promising. "My assumption is that unless you get onto a vaccine study, you\'re not going to have access to any vaccine anytime soon," Gill said, "which is obviously quite heartbreaking."In the 1990s, when antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV were developed, South Africans volunteered for clinical trials, knowing that they could never afford the medicine otherwise. "If you had money, you were able to buy it. If you didn\'t, you died," Venter said. "It\'s going to be the same thing again."Covax was set up to prevent that. It came together with money and support from the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. Countries, even those that cannot hope to compete on the open market, can buy into Covax and receive vaccines. Poor countries pay nothing.Secret DealsSouth African medical advisers say the Covax system is incredibly important but also deeply frustrating. Governments must pay upfront without knowing what vaccine they will receive or getting any guarantees on when the doses will arrive. Covax estimates the price per dose but offers little recourse if the cost is ultimately much higher. Countries must assume all of the risk if the vaccine fails or if anything goes wrong.During a recent call with reporters, Covax officials called their vaccine sharing program "the only global solution to this pandemic.""We still need more doses and, yes, we still need more money, but we have a clear pathway to securing the initial 2 billion doses and then beyond that," said Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.Still, Berkley and other officials declined to reveal their arrangements with drug companies, describing them as company secrets. They also did not make public the deals they have struck with individual countries."They\'re agreeing to buy something with public money, and we won\'t have any influence on pricing," said Fatima Hassan, a human rights lawyer. "Covax is saying the pricing is fair, but we don\'t know. Where\'s the transparency?"Those trade-offs might be palatable for countries receiving the medicine nearly free. But South Africa is paying about $140 million for its Covax doses to vaccinate roughly 10% of its population, including health care workers and some high-risk people. The government hopes to cover the country\'s remaining 50 million people through private deals with drug companies.Globally, the process is secretive, with governments not disclosing the prices they are paying for vaccines. When a Belgian minister recently published the European Union\'s price list, she revealed that prices vary depending on who\'s doing the buying.Many South Africans are deeply skeptical of pharmaceutical companies and wary of rampant government corruption. The health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said in a recent call with reporters that it was essential that rich countries not hoard vaccines, but otherwise the government has said little about its plans.Outraged, health advocates have threatened to sue the country\'s government to make the plans public.Ultimately, though, money is the great differentiator. From the outset, South Africa\'s government knew it could not afford to order doses before they were tested and approved, as wealthy countries did."While these countries have gone on a shopping spree, we haven\'t even started window shopping," Ames Dhai, a bioethics professor and member of the government\'s vaccine advisory panel, told doctors on a recent webinar.No GuaranteeSouth Africa has seen this play out before. In 2009, when the world feared a devastating H1N1 flu outbreak, rich countries hoarded the earliest vaccines. While the outbreak was far weaker than expected, it revealed the inequities that exist when countries compete for lifesaving medicine.One example is the HPV vaccine, a drug that can prevent cervical cancer but is in short supply in South Africa. Supplies are so tight that the World Health Organization has recommended that wealthy countries temporarily stop expanding their vaccinating campaigns to cover boys, so other nations can focus at least on covering young girls.For the COVID-19 vaccine, government officials and advisers say they have met with or received preliminary inquiries from most of the major drug companies.Abdool Karim, the head of the country\'s coronavirus council, said the country needed to be judicious in choosing a vaccine that best fits the needs of South Africa. Rushing to buy the Pfizer vaccine, for example, which requires shipping and storage at ultracold temperatures, made no sense when cheaper, simpler and more manageable medicines were on the horizon, he said.But because South Africa did not preorder doses from private companies, the country may have to watch its own domestic drugmaker, Aspen Pharmacare, produce vaccines for other countries before they are available domestically.Under contract with Johnson & Johnson, Aspen is expected to produce millions of vaccine doses. South African officials have high hopes for the vaccine, which does not need cold storage and promises to require one injection rather than two."We\'ll participate in your trials, we\'ll manufacture your vaccines, but we don\'t know if we\'ll get access," Hassan said.Johnson & Johnson has promised to sell its vaccines at break-even prices and provide half a billion doses to Covax to help poor countries. Aspen\'s chief executive, Stephen Saad, said he was proud of that commitment. But he acknowledged that there is no guarantee for South Africa."It\'s J&J\'s decision as to where the product goes," he said.South Africa, which is now past 1 million COVID-19 cases, is facing its second wave. Public health officials are particularly worried about a new mutation that they believe may have made the virus more contagious.In poor and working-class townships, the greater fear is of a new lockdown. The government\'s earlier aggressive lockdown devastated the economy and confined many people to tin shacks built an arm\'s length apart, with a dozen families sharing an outhouse and many more sharing a water tap."It\'s impossible to have social distancing here," said Mzwamadoda, who was selected for the drug trial.He is counting on the vaccine, hoping he got the actual medicine and not a placebo. "I want my life back," he said.Mzwamadoda woke up the day after his injection feeling well. He talked it over with his wife, and they decided that she would walk to Gill\'s clinic and enroll that weekend.A few days later, though, Gill got word that Johnson & Johnson did not need any new test subjects at her location.Data was pouring in. A good outcome, but that meant that when people began lining up at the gates early the next morning, she had to turn them away.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '8ce558de335a4c0e88be9e89b4d59df9', 'title': 'Is This the End of Cuomo?', 'description': 'Embattled New York governor Andrew Cuomo insists he will never resign, and observers believe that he’s shameless enough to try to ride out his twin nursing-home and sexual-harassment scandals. “People have short attention spans; I think he’s counting on that,” former GOP congressman Peter King told Newsmax TV. After all, two years ago, Virginia governor Ralph Northam was also urged by his fellow Democrats to resign after racist photos of him surfaced, including one from his 1984 medical-school yearbook. Northam apologized, rather vaguely, but refused to resign. He remains in office today. But events may yet break Cuomo’s hold on the governor’s mansion. As of yesterday, PredictIt, the predictions market for political junkies, puts the odds of him staying in office until the end of this year at just 28 percent. One factor is that more bad news for Cuomo may be about to break. Journalist John Heilemann told NBC’s Meet The Press today, “Every major news organization that I know of right now has a team of people trying to push this story further. And there are a lot of hot leads out there.” Would anyone be surprised that a governor with many enemies — and who has escaped close media scrutiny for so long, and whose biographer described him as “a bad guy” at the core — might have more skeletons to unearth? During his decade in office, Cuomo has been mired in scandals that sent close allies, such as Alain Kaloyeros, founder of SUNY Polytechnic Institute, and Joe Percoco, the governor’s “enforcer,” to prison. A 2014 investigation by the New York Times found that the governor’s office “deeply compromised” an ethics panel’s work, “objecting whenever the commission focused on groups with ties to Cuomo or on issues that might reflect poorly on him.” Then there is impeachment. The state assembly has begun a preliminary investigation into whether Cuomo should be removed from office. If Cuomo were impeached by a majority vote of the assembly, he would almost certainly be forced to step aside immediately, pending the outcome of a trial in the Senate. Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul would become acting governor. That’s a big difference from the procedure followed when the U.S. president is impeached — a president remains in office during the trial. Cuomo would no doubt argue that the law isn’t clear, but the only previous time a New York governor was impeached — William Sulzer in 1913 — his lieutenant governor was indeed appointed acting governor. Cuomo’s allies report that he is embittered at how quickly his fellow Democrats have turned on him. Larry Schwartz, Cuomo’s former top aide and now New York’s “vaccine czar,” has called many county officials to gauge their loyalty to the governor. One of those officials told the Washington Post that the call was so unsettling that an ethics complaint is being filed with the public-integrity unit of the state attorney general’s office. “At best, it was inappropriate,” the unidentified official told the Post. “At worst, it was clearly over the ethical line.” Cuomo, a tightly wound man with few interests outside politics, has so much of his identity tied up in being governor that some former aides believe that his resolve to never resign might weaken if he were impeached. “He would lose his powers immediately and could be adrift for weeks or months before a Senate trial finished,” one told me. “I don’t think he could psychologically handle it. I think he might cut a deal in which he gives up his office with the understanding that he is largely left untouched legally.” Whatever happens, the collapse of Cuomo’s political standing makes it unlikely he could run for a fourth term. The allegations of sexual harassment are devastating. But the cover-up of thousands of nursing-home deaths — though far less covered by the media than the sexual-harassment allegations — also led voters to conclude by 45 percent to 36 percent that Cuomo should resign immediately, according to an Emerson College poll from two weeks ago. In 1974, the journalist Nicholas von Hoffman created a controversy when, as a paid commentator on CBS’s 60 Minutes, he called the scandal-plagued President Nixon “a dead mouse on the kitchen floor that everyone was afraid to touch and put in the garbage.” That was back when authority figures were shown more respect, and von Hoffman was fired for that outburst. Today, the political class in New York is treating Andrew Cuomo as a modern-day Richard Nixon. Everyone realizes he has to go eventually. They just haven’t figured out exactly how to maneuver him into the political dustbin.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

A half-million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, produced by an Indian manufacturer, were delivered to the capital, Kabul, by India on Feb. 7. But the arrival was greeted with indifference by many Afghans, who have rebuffed government warnings that the virus is a deadly public health threat. The cheap and easy-to-store AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is being delivered as part of the Covax program, a worldwide initiative to buy and distribute vaccines to poor countries for free or at a reduced cost. On Feb. 15, the World Health Organization authorized use of the vaccine, which requires two doses per person, clearing the path for Afghanistan to begin its inoculation campaign. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Global trials have found that the vaccine offered complete protection against severe disease and death. But its efficacy against the virus variant first seen in South Africa is in question, after the vaccine failed in a small trial to prevent study participants from getting mild or moderate COVID cases. The vaccine arrives as Afghanistan is fighting off a second deadly wave, even as most Afghans go about their daily lives as if the virus never existed. Many people refuse to wear masks and cluster in dense crowds inside bazaars, supermarkets, restaurants and mosques, oblivious to ubiquitous public health posters. In an impoverished nation battered by war, hunger, poverty and drought, an invisible virus is considered fake or an afterthought. “Of course I won’t take the vaccine because I don’t believe in the existence of the coronavirus,” said Muhibullah Armani, 30, a taxi driver in the southern city of Kandahar. Expressing a sentiment shared by many Afghans, Armani added, “When I see people covering their mouth and nose, afraid of COVID, it makes me laugh at them.” And even among Afghans who believe the virus is real and want to be inoculated, there is little faith that the government, mired in pervasive corruption, will equitably distribute limited vaccine supplies. “This vaccine will be available just for high status people,” said Khalil Jan Gurbazwal, a civil society activist in Khost province in eastern Afghanistan. Nizamuddin, a tribal elder in a Taliban-controlled district in Faryab province in northern Afghanistan, said he feared the vaccine would be appropriated by well-connected politicians and warlords. “It is common in Afghanistan for even food aid to be stolen by corrupt people,” said Nizamuddin, who like many Afghans goes by one name. The Attorney General’s Office said Thursday that 74 government officials from five provinces had been charged with embezzling coronavirus response funds. Among those charged were former provincial governors and deputy governors. In Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan, a hospital administrator told authorities that hospital officials collected medical costs for COVID-19 treatments for 50 beds in a hospital with just 25 beds, pocketing charges for “ghost workers,” the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction recently reported. “This malfeasance costs Afghan citizens not just financially, but in delayed access to potentially lifesaving medical care,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. But for many Afghans, the vaccine is a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. As the vaccination program got underway Tuesday, the first dose was administered at the presidential palace in Kabul to Anisa Shaheed, a television reporter who has covered the pandemic. Distributing any vaccine in a desperately poor nation consumed by unrest is a daunting logistical challenge. In addition to overcoming public suspicions and traversing dangerous territories, the Ministry of Public Health must also navigate vaccine delivery in remote provinces with poor roads and primitive infrastructure. The pandemic has prompted a rise in polio cases in Afghanistan because it has made it more difficult for polio teams to reach outlying areas, said Dr. Osman Tahiri, public affairs adviser for the health ministry, which reported 56 polio cases in 2020, up from 29 in 2019. But equally worrying are the 305 cases of a variant of polio in Afghanistan in 2020, versus zero such cases reported in 2019, said Merjan Rasekh, head of public awareness for the ministry’s polio eradication program. Rasekh attributed much of the increase in the variant polio cases to Afghan refugees returning from neighboring Pakistan, which has also struggled to eradicate polio. The WHO is expected to grant emergency approval by year’s end for a vaccine against the variant. While contending with a rise of polio cases, Tahiri said health workers would try to distribute the coronavirus vaccine even in Taliban-controlled areas where the militants have permitted government-run clinics. The Taliban have mounted public health programs warning of the pandemic and have distributed personal protection equipment while allowing government health workers into their areas. But Tahiri conceded that vaccination teams will not be able to reach broad swaths of the country where fighting is heaviest between the Taliban and government forces. A thousand vaccination teams were trained last week, Tahiri said. The ministry hopes to receive more donated vaccines; Afghanistan, he said, has a capacity to store 20 million doses. The first doses will go to health workers and security officials “who are at risk and working in crowded places,” Tahiri said, though there is not yet enough vaccine for everyone in this category. Journalists would also be eligible to apply to receive the vaccine, he added. Afghanistan has recorded more than 55,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 2,500 COVID-related deaths, according to the Ministry of Public Health. But because of limited testing and an inadequate public health system, experts say the actual number of cases and deaths is exponentially higher. A WHO model estimated in May that more than half of Afghanistan’s estimated 34 million people could become infected. The Ministry of Public Health estimated in the fall that more than 10 million Afghans may have contracted the virus. Regardless of whether Afghans believe the virus is real, there is an abiding faith that Allah determines a believer’s fate. Ahmad Shah Ahmadi, a resident of Khost province, said there is no need to take the vaccine. “Infidels don’t believe in God, and that’s why they fear the coronavirus. For Muslims, there is little danger,” he said. But Imam Nazar, 46, a farmer in Kunduz province, said most residents of his village believe the virus is real because several villagers have died of COVID-19. He said he and other villagers were eager to get the vaccine but doubted that it would reach their remote town. “This government doesn’t keep its promises,” Nazar said.

{'_id': '475d27b2eaa1c0ce599cb9a48db3f976', 'title': "New York Was the 1st Big School District to Reopen. Here's What Happened.", 'description': 'NEW YORK — For Julie Zuckerman, an elementary school principal in Manhattan, last summer felt like one never-ending day filled with fear and confusion about New York City’s plan to resume in-person teaching. But in the months since classrooms opened in September, something has shifted. Teachers at the school, Public School 513 in Washington Heights, appear more at ease, and some say they would like to be in their classrooms even when the building closes because of coronavirus cases. Parents, too, seem more confident: About half of the students are in the building most days, up from less than one-third in September. Zuckerman expects that even more children will return this spring. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “People have made their peace; they’re not in crisis in the same way,” she said. “I feel there’s a huge night-and-day difference between what was going on last spring and what’s happened this year.” New York’s push to become the first big school district in the country to reopen classrooms last fall was a high-stakes and risky experiment. It has had its share of miscommunication, logistical stumbles and disruptions — especially when classrooms and school buildings are frequently closed because of virus cases. But in interviews, parents, teachers, principals and union leaders also provided reasons for optimism at the midpoint of the academic year. In-school transmission of the coronavirus been very low, and there has also been broad agreement that children have benefited from being in classrooms. “Having the kids here is so much better for them, for everyone,” Zuckerman said. The strength of the plan will be tested again in the coming weeks, as about 62,000 middle school students are set to return to classrooms for the first time since November. New York also offers the clearest preview in the United States of what other big city districts — most prominently Chicago, where more schools are set to open next month — can expect as they inch closer to reopening classrooms after almost a year of remote learning. Despite President Joe Biden’s push to reopen more schools this spring, some districts — including Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest system — do not yet have a plan to reopen at all this school year. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that schools should open as soon as possible, particularly for young children. The CDC found that teacher vaccines are not a precondition for reopening, a finding that has been backed up by New York’s safety record so far. The guidance came as teachers unions across the country have continued to push back on reopening plans. Districts that do reopen to students in the coming weeks and months are likely to discover that it is just a first step. New Yorkers have struggled to cope with the frequent interruptions to learning — and parents’ schedules — caused when virus cases are detected among students or staff members and classrooms and entire school buildings are forced into all-remote instruction. The city requires schools to shutter for up to 10 days if two unrelated positive cases are confirmed in a building. Individual classrooms close when one or more positive cases are detected. The number of closed classrooms and schools has risen considerably over the last few weeks, as test positivity rates across the city have remained high and weekly in-school testing has increased. Between Jan. 4 and Feb. 10, 580 of 1,052 open school buildings closed for up to two weeks. Fewer than 400 school buildings have not had a closing of any kind in the new year. Zuckerman said that her school, for example, has been open for only about 10 in-person days in 2021. The rule was developed at a moment when it was unclear whether Mayor Bill de Blasio had the political support to reopen schools, and when there was much less evidence that schools could reopen safely. The protocol was part of a package of safety measures, agreed on with union leaders over the summer, that allowed New York City to open its schools in the first place. De Blasio said earlier this month that he would reevaluate the two-case rule, though city officials said it was highly unlikely that safety measures would change before the reopening of middle schools. For parents of elementary school children, the reopening experience has prompted a roller coaster of emotions: despair over the limits of remote learning; joy at seeing their children back in classrooms; and frustration with the chaos caused by closings. Last month, for example, Hien Sosa finally got the news that her son could soon return full time to his first-grade classroom in East Elmhurst, Queens. “I was like, wow, I feel like I just won the lottery,” Sosa, a hospital nurse, recalled. She and her husband, a police officer, could not stay home on the days when their son learned remotely. Sosa’s mother, who helps with child care, speaks limited English and has trouble supervising her grandson’s lessons. Sosa said she felt “ready to give up.” But her relief about the new schedule was short-lived. Just a few days after her son began attending school five days a week, Sosa learned that the school would close for 10 days because two people in the building tested positive. He returned a few days ago and comes home happy at the end of the day. “I know he gets some real learning, just a regular school day like he always had,” Sosa said. But she said she felt like she was on borrowed time until the school shuts again. As closures have increased, some parents have called on the city to change the rule. But the city’s influential teachers union has vigorously protested any change, saying schools are safe in part because of the conservative threshold for closures. But the union, the United Federation of Teachers, may face growing pressure to accept changes to the rule as more teachers are vaccinated. The union has directly arranged for about 15,500 educators to be vaccinated, according to a union spokesperson, while many other teachers have gotten their shots through regular channels. Even before vaccines arrived in New York, the city’s schools had not seen high transmission; the average test positivity rate in city schools was 0.55% between October and last Thursday. The seven-day citywide average has been hovering around 8%. The statistics are partially explained by the random weekly testing of asymptomatic students and staff members, which results in lower rates than citywide testing of people who are showing symptoms or think they have been exposed to the virus. But the schools statistic also bolsters the view, widely held by health experts, that classrooms can be relatively safe if educators enforce safety measures like mask-wearing and social distancing, which are required in city schools. After de Blasio shuttered the entire system in mid-November because of rising virus cases, he reopened classrooms only for children with complex disabilities and elementary school students in December. Recently, he announced that middle schools would reopen Feb. 25. City officials say most middle schools will be able to accommodate many students five days a week. About 500 of the 878 elementary schools and schools for children with disabilities that are already open are serving most students full time. It is not clear whether city high schools will reopen this school year. Once both elementary and middle schools are open, up to 250,000 of the city’s roughly 1 million students will be able to return to classrooms. Still, the vast majority of city families — roughly 70% — have decided to keep their children learning from home for the rest of the school year. White students, who make up a minority of the overall system, are overrepresented in open classrooms. Chloe Davis, a teacher in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, said her elementary school has been closed several times since Thanksgiving. That prompted some families to shift to remote learning to regain consistency. “We haven’t been able to find a rhythm at all,” she said. Davis’ school shares a building with two others, and if two students test positive in any of the three schools, the entire building is closed. The stream of closings is especially frustrating for working parents like Elisa Muñiz, a pediatrician and single parent of a second grader in Washington Heights. Muñiz said her son, who receives special education services, had been in his classroom for fewer than 30 days since September. “I can’t tell you how many times the school has closed; it’s a ton,” she said. “It doesn’t just disrupt home life. I’m someone who has a responsibility to be in person at work. It requires a lot more flexibility than sometimes we’re able to have.” Muñiz has watched her son, an only child, thrive on the days when he is in classrooms with his friends. But he is easily distracted and restless when he switches back to online learning. She wishes she could ask the mayor, “How are we going to help the kids who aren’t making progress?” New York’s teachers say they are working harder than at any other point in their careers to address that question. Tiffany Koo, who teaches at an elementary school in the East Village, decided last year to take sole responsibility for a group of students learning online, and another in person, because of a staffing shortage at her school. She livestreams her lessons daily from her classroom so that all students can follow along, and spends nights and weekends working on lesson plans. “I don’t ever regret it, but it has been incredibly chaotic and difficult at times,” she said of her schedule. “I’m taking it day by day.” Some days, Koo is not sure the trade-offs of reopening are worth it. Still, she understands why so many parents and students want classrooms to be fully open as soon as possible. She just asks that New Yorkers be patient. “We all wish this was different,” she said. “Let’s just be kind to each other. We’re all trying to do the best we can.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

By comparison, the UK has ordered 30m doses as well as 100m doses of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine, which is also approved for use in Britain — enough to immunise the entire population. “It’s also because the EU is not directly authorized, but the member states have a say.

The fate of those doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine is the subject of an intense debate among White House and federal health officials, with some arguing the administration should let them go abroad where they are desperately needed, while others are not ready to relinquish them, according to senior administration officials. AstraZeneca is involved in those conversations. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “We understand other governments may have reached out to the U.S. government about donation of AstraZeneca doses, and we’ve asked the U.S. government to give thoughtful consideration to these requests,” said Gonzalo Viña, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca. About 30 million doses are currently bottled at AstraZeneca’s facility in West Chester, Ohio, which handles “fill-finish,” the final phase of the manufacturing process, during which the vaccine is placed in vials, one official with knowledge of the stockpile said. Emergent BioSolutions, a company in Maryland that AstraZeneca has contracted to manufacture its vaccine in the United States, has also produced enough vaccine in Baltimore for tens of millions more doses once it is filled into vials and packaged, the official said. But although AstraZeneca’s vaccine is already authorized in more than 70 countries, according to a company spokesperson, its U.S. clinical trial has not yet reported results, and the company has not applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization. AstraZeneca has asked the Biden administration to let it loan U.S. doses to the European Union, where it has fallen short of its original supply commitments and where the vaccination campaign has stumbled badly. The administration, for now, has denied the request, one official said. Some federal officials have pushed the White House to make a decision in the next few weeks. Officials have discussed sending doses to the European Union, Britain and Brazil, all hit hard by a worsening coronavirus crisis. “If those donation actions were to proceed, we would seek guidance from the U.S. government on replacement of doses for use in the U.S.,” Viña said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The administration’s hesitation is at least partly related to uncertainties with vaccine supply before a bench mark of late May laid down by President Joe Biden — when he promised enough vaccine doses to cover every adult in the United States. Vaccine production is notoriously complex and delicate, and problems like mold growth can interrupt a plant’s progress. Last May, the Trump administration pledged up to $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca to finance the development and manufacturing of its vaccine, which it developed with the University of Oxford, and to supply the United States with 300 million doses if it proved effective. Federal officials and public health experts last year viewed the vaccine, which is less expensive and easier to store for long periods than some other vaccines, as most likely to be among the first to receive authorization. That never happened, in part because of a pattern of communication blunders by AstraZeneca that weakened the company’s relationship with U.S. regulators and slowed the vaccine’s development. Last fall, AstraZeneca’s trial in the United States — the same one that will soon report results — was grounded for nearly seven weeks because the company was slow to provide the FDA with evidence that the vaccine had not caused serious neurological side effects in two volunteers. The company is now grappling with another safety scare. Acting out of precaution, health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland suspended use of the AstraZeneca’s vaccine Thursday after several reports across the continent of severe blood clots. European official and the company said there was not evidence of any causal link. In the vast majority of cases, the emergence of such medical conditions has nothing to do with the vaccine. Some percentage of people are expected to fall ill by chance after getting vaccinated, as would happen in any group of people. AstraZeneca has also run into other problems as its vaccine has rolled out. The shortfall in supply has fueled tensions with European officials. Some people in Germany and other countries have balked at taking the vaccine, for fear it is second-class because of its lower overall efficacy in clinical trials compared with the vaccine from Pfizer. South Africa last month halted its plans to introduce the vaccine after a small clinical trial found that the vaccine did not appear to be protective against mild to moderate illness caused by a concerning coronavirus variant first seen there. In the United States, the Biden administration’s moves to order more supply of the three vaccines authorized by the FDA has further sidelined AstraZeneca’s candidate. The United States may only briefly, or never, need the AstraZeneca doses if they are cleared for emergency use. “If we have a surplus, we’re going to share it with the rest of the world,” Biden told reporters Wednesday, speaking generally about the U.S. vaccine supply. “We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first.” Johnson & Johnson, which has authorization for its vaccine in the United States but fell behind on its production targets in both the United States and Europe, recently asked the United States to loan 10 million doses to the European Union, but the Biden administration also denied that request, according to American and European officials. The European Union has come under fierce criticism for “vaccine nationalism” and protectionism, which intensified last week when Italy blocked a small shipment of doses to Australia, stepping up a tug of war over badly needed shots. Still, the European Union exported 34 million doses of coronavirus vaccines in recent weeks to dozens of countries, even as it faced shortages at home. As frustrations simmer, some European officials are blaming the United States. The European Council president, Charles Michel, said the United States, along with Britain, “have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory.” Asked Thursday about the U.S. supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters that vaccine manufacturers were free to export their products made in the United States while also fulfilling the terms of their contracts with the government. Because AstraZeneca’s vaccine was produced with help from the Defense Production Act, Biden has to approve shipments of doses overseas. Such a move could have huge negative political repercussions as long as Americans are still clamoring for shots. AstraZeneca is also likely to want liability protection for doses shipped overseas, like it would have in the United States if the vaccine is cleared. Meantime, regulators in the United States have been waiting for new AstraZeneca data, expected in the next few weeks, from a phase 3 trial that enrolled 32,000 participants mostly in the United States. AstraZeneca is not likely to report results from an early look at its data as other vaccine-makers have done. It will instead wait for more statistically meaningful results after trial participants have been monitored longer for side effects and more people in the vaccine and placebo groups may have gotten sick, federal officials said. Experts believe the vaccine is unlikely to carry a higher efficacy rate than the shot made by Johnson & Johnson, which uses a similar technology and requires only one dose. The potential for those results means that AstraZeneca’s vaccine might not have an obvious advantage in the United States over the vaccines currently authorized. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is easy to distribute and protects against severe disease and hospitalizations. The two-dose vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which use a different technology, have efficacy rates around 95%. Federal officials have also emphasized in the discussions that AstraZeneca’s vaccine should not be stored indefinitely in Ohio or Maryland since it, like all vaccines, has a limited shelf life. The vaccine can be kept at refrigerator temperatures for six months, and some countries are giving the two doses spaced up to three months apart — raising the risk that the doses could go bad if they sit too long. Biden is taking steps to ramp up vaccine production, and the administration may have more than 1 billion doses available by the end of this year, with most ready by summer. That is far more than are necessary to vaccinate the roughly 260 million adults in the United States or even the entire population, once children and adolescents become eligible for shots. Most recently, the administration has focused on Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine, brokering a deal to have pharmaceutical giant Merck manufacture and bottle the shot and announcing plans to secure 100 million additional doses. Before the Merck deal was announced, administration officials discussed whether Johnson & Johnson should take over AstraZeneca’s manufacturing space in Baltimore, which the company shares with Johnson & Johnson. The process of stopping the production of vaccines takes weeks. And because AstraZeneca has a contract with Emergent, the Maryland manufacturer, White House intervention would be difficult. The idea was dropped once the Merck partnership was sealed. The administration says it is increasing the supply to eventually vaccinate children and possibly to make booster doses or to guard against emerging variants that may be able to escape the protection conferred by some vaccines. But privately, two senior administration officials said that by helping Johnson & Johnson scale up with the Merck deal, the White House is laying the groundwork for the company to eventually make its vaccine available overseas.

Although many Republicans supported coronavirus relief under former President Donald Trump, not a single Republican lawmaker voted for the bill in the House or Senate.Democrats see the legislation as a critical response to a pandemic that has killed more than 528,000 people in the country and thrown millions out of work. [DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER STENY HOYER]: “It will put money in Americans’ pockets. It will put children back in classrooms. It will put millions of Americans back to work and reopen businesses safely.” Republicans said the measure was too costly and packed with wasteful progressive priorities. [REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE LAUREN BOEBERT]: "This is nothing more than a trashy spending spree while doing nothing for those who have suffered the most from this China virus." Nevertheless, Republican-leaning states are due to get a disproportionate share of many of its benefits, including education and child-care aid per resident, according to estimates from two congressional committees. And it’s popular with the public. A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 70% of Americans support the plan.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden plans to sign the bill Friday, and that he, Vice President Kamala Harris and First Lady Jill Biden would hit the road to promote it to Americans.“I’m going to talk about what comes next….” The bill’s passage comes as Biden prepares to deliver his first primetime address to the nation Thursday, marking one year since the country’s first COVID-19 shutdowns.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday that the vaccine, which is currently in use in the United States for adults, demonstrated 100 percent efficacy in the trial. It also demonstrated "robust antibody responses, exceeding those recorded earlier in vaccinated participants aged 16 to 25 years old, and was well tolerated." This study consisted of 2,260 adolescents in the United States between 12 and 15, and there were 18 cases of COVID-19 reported in the placebo group, but no cases in the group that was vaccinated. "The initial results we have seen in the adolescent studies suggest that children are particularly well protected by vaccination, which is very encouraging given the trends we have seen in recent weeks regarding the spread of the B.1.1.7 UK variant," BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said. This was the latest piece of encouraging data surrounding the Pfizer vaccine after the CDC released a study showing both it and the Moderna vaccine were "highly effective" in real-world conditions, preventing about 90 percent of infections two weeks after both doses in adults. Experts quickly hailed the trial results released Wednesday, with Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki telling The New York Times, "Oh my god, I’m so happy to see this — this is amazing." Iwasaki added that the fact that the study showed the group "getting even better levels" of antibodies than young adults was "really incredible. Pfizer and BioNTech say they will submit this new data to the FDA with "the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year."

And Again.', 'description': 'The routine things in Chris Long\'s life used to include biking 30 miles three times a week and taking courses toward a Ph.D. in eight-week sessions.But since getting sick with the coronavirus in March, Long, 54, has fallen into a distressing new cycle -- one that so far has landed him in the hospital seven times.Periodically since his initial five-day hospitalization, his lungs begin filling again; he starts coughing uncontrollably and runs a low fever. Roughly 18 days later, he spews up greenish-yellow fluid, signaling yet another bout of pneumonia.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesSoon, his oxygen levels drop and his heart rate accelerates to compensate, sending him to a hospital near his home in Clarkston, Michigan, for several days, sometimes in intensive care."This will never go away," he said, describing his worst fear. "This will be my going-forward for the foreseeable future."Nearly a year into the pandemic, it\'s clear that recovering from COVID-19\'s initial onslaught can be an arduous, uneven journey. Now, studies reveal that a significant subset of patients are having to return to hospitals, sometimes repeatedly, with complications triggered by the disease or by the body\'s efforts to defeat the virus.Even as vaccines give hope for stopping the spread of the virus, the surge of new cases portends repeated hospitalizations for more patients, taxing medical resources and turning some people\'s path to recovery into a Sisyphean odyssey that upends their lives."It\'s an urgent medical and public health question," said Dr. Girish Nadkarni, an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who, with another assistant professor, Dr. Anuradha Lala, is studying readmissions of COVID-19 patients.Data on rehospitalizations of coronavirus patients are incomplete, but early studies suggest that in the United States alone, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands could ultimately return to the hospital.A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 106,543 coronavirus patients initially hospitalized between March and July found that 1 in 11 was readmitted within two months of being discharged, with 1.6% of patients readmitted more than once.In another study of 1,775 coronavirus patients discharged from 132 VA hospitals in the pandemic\'s early months, nearly a fifth were rehospitalized within 60 days. More than 22% of them needed intensive care, and 7% required ventilators.And in a report on 1,250 patients discharged from 38 Michigan hospitals from mid-March to July, 15% were rehospitalized within 60 days.Recurring admissions don\'t just involve patients who were severely ill the first time around."Even if they had a very mild course, at least one-third have significant symptomology two to three months out," said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief of infectious diseases at Brown University\'s Warren Alpert Medical School and Lifespan hospitals, who co-wrote another report. "There is a wave of readmissions that is building, because at some point these people will say \'I\'m not well.\'"Many who are rehospitalized were vulnerable to serious symptoms because they were over 65 or had chronic conditions. But some younger and previously healthy people have returned to hospitals, too.When Becca Meyer, 31, of Paw Paw, Michigan, contracted the coronavirus in early March, she initially stayed home, nursing symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, fever, extreme fatigue and hallucinations that included visions of being attacked by a sponge in the shower.Meyer, a mother of four, eventually was hospitalized for a week in March and again in April. She was readmitted for an infection in August and for severe nausea in September, according to medical records, which labeled her condition "long haul COVID-19."Because she couldn\'t hold down food, doctors discharged her with a nasal feeding tube connected to protein-and-electrolyte formula on a pole, which, she said, "I\'m supposed to be attached to 20 hours a day."Feeding tube issues required hospitalization for nearly three weeks in October and a week in December. She has been unable to resume her job in customer service, spent the summer using a walker, and has had a home health nurse for weeks."It\'s been a roller coaster since March and I\'m now in the downswing of it, where I\'m back to being in bed all the time and not being able to eat much, coughing a lot more, having more chest pain," she said.Readmissions strain hospital resources, and returning patients may be exposed to new infections or develop muscle atrophy from being bedridden. Long and Meyer said they contracted the bacterial infection C. difficile during rehospitalizations."Readmissions have been associated, even before COVID, with worse patient outcomes," Mylonakis said.Some research suggests implications for hospitals currently overwhelmed with cases. A Mount Sinai Hospital study of New York\'s first wave found that patients with shorter initial stays and those not sick enough for intensive care were more likely to return within two weeks.Lala, who co-wrote the study, said the thinking at overstretched hospitals was "we have a lack of resources, so if the patients are stable get them home." But, she added, "the fact that length of stay was indeed shorter for those patients who return is begging the question of: Were we kicking these people out the door too soon?"Many rehospitalized patients have respiratory problems, but some have blood clots, heart trouble, sepsis, gastrointestinal symptoms or other issues, doctors report. Some have neurological symptoms like brain fog, "a clear cognitive issue that is evident when they get readmitted," said Dr. Vineet Chopra, chief of hospital medicine at the University of Michigan, who co-wrote the Michigan study. "It is there, and it is real."Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, said causes of readmissions vary."Sometimes there\'s a lot of push to get patients out of the hospital, and they want to get out of the hospital and sometimes they\'re not ready," so they return, she said. But some appropriately discharged patients develop additional problems or return to hospitals because they lack affordable outpatient care.Long\'s ordeal began on March 9. "I couldn\'t stand up without falling over," he said.His primary physician, Dr. Benjamin Diaczok, immediately told him to call an ambulance."I crawled out to the front door," recalled Long. He was barefoot and remembers sticking out his arm to prop open the door for the ambulance crew, who found him facedown.He awoke three days later, in the hospital, when he accidentally pulled out the tubes to the ventilator he had been hooked up to. After two more days, he had stabilized enough to return to the apartment where he lives alone, an hour north of Detroit.Long had some previous health issues, including blood clots in his lungs and legs several years ago and an irregular heartbeat requiring an implanted heart monitor in 2018. Still, before COVID-19, he was "very high-functioning, very energetic," Diaczok said.Now, Long said: "I\'ve got scarred lungs, pulmonary fibrosis, and I\'m running right around 75-80% lung capacity."He was rehospitalized in April, May, June, July, August and September, requiring oxygen and intravenous antibiotics, potassium and magnesium."Something must have happened to his lungs that is making them more prone for this," Diaczok said.Long, a former consultant on tank systems for the military, is also experiencing brain fog that has forced a hiatus from classes toward a Ph.D. in business convergence strategy."I read 10 pages in one of my textbooks and then five minutes later, after a phone call, I can\'t remember what I read," he said."It\'s horrible," Diaczok said. "This is a man that thinks for a living, and he can\'t do his job."And his heart arrhythmia, controlled since 2018, has resurfaced. Unless Long, who is 6-foot-7, sleeps at an incline on his couch, his heart skips beats, causing his monitor to prompt middle-of-the-night calls from his doctor\'s office. Unable to lie in bed, "I don\'t sleep through the night."Small exertions -- "just to stand up to go do the dishes" -- are exhausting. In July, he tried starting physical therapy but was told he wasn\'t ready.In August, he got up too fast, fell and "I was very confused," he recalled. During that hospital readmission, doctors noted "altered mental status" from dehydration and treated him for pneumonia and functional lung collapse.In late October, Long developed pneumonia again, but under Diaczok\'s guidance, managed at home with antibiotics.In December, when a pulmonologist administered a breathing test, "I couldn\'t make it six seconds," he said.Long repeatedly measures his temperature and pulse oxygen, and can feel in his chest when "trouble\'s coming," he said. Determined to recover, he tries to walk short distances. "Can I make it to take out the trash?" he\'ll ask himself. On a good day, he\'ll walk 8 feet to his mailbox."I\'m going to be around to walk my daughters down the aisle and see my grandkids," said Long, voice cracking. "I\'m not going to let this thing win."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '000cb4d336a95b9d788db690f7100d59', 'title': 'Why 530 Frozen Bodies Sit in a Brooklyn Warehouse', 'description': 'NEW YORK -- At the marine terminal in South Brooklyn this month, a sign that said "funeral director" pointed to the left of a vast warehouse just past the guard gate. A row of 53-foot refrigerated trailers, about 20 in all, sat in the black-tarred parking lot. Tucked past the fashionable furniture warehouses of Industry City and next to a crumbling pier building, the facility was quiet.New York City officials believe this little-known site will help them avoid a repeat of one of the most shocking tragedies of COVID-19\'s first wave: the crush of bodies that overwhelmed the city\'s capacity for dealing with the dead.The warehouses at the pier held about 570 bodies earlier this month, most of which have been there, frozen, for months, with room for hundreds more.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAs the virus surges across the country, states and cities have been ordering or using refrigerated trailers for excess morgue capacity after watching New York\'s example in the spring. In Texas, 10 trailers were delivered to El Paso in early November. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced recently that the state had 60 refrigerated trailers standing by as makeshift morgues.But no other city yet appears to have had a death surge so severe that bodies have had to be held for months on end.New York City experienced a harrowing wave of fatalities as it became the global epicenter of the virus in the spring, with 17,507 confirmed virus deaths between March 14 and June 18. At the peak of the pandemic in early April, about 800 people died in a single day.More than 135 refrigerated trailers were deployed to the streets around hospitals, in what became one of the most enduring images of the city\'s crisis. But that was not enough. Shelves were placed in the trailers, doubling their capacity, as funeral directors ran out of storage room. Cemeteries and crematories could not handle the load.One Brooklyn hospital resorted to using a forklift to lift shrouded bodies into its morgue trailer, and a funeral home was caught storing dozens of decomposing bodies in two U-Haul trucks and its visitation rooms.In an effort to ease the backlog, the medical examiner\'s office buried dozens of unclaimed bodies in early April at Hart Island, its potter\'s field. But a few weeks later, it pivoted by transforming the huge waterfront warehouse in South Brooklyn into a long-term freezer storage facility for the dead -- allowing overwhelmed families to hold off on retrieving bodies for months before a Hart Island burial would be considered."What they came up with, these freezer containers for long-term storage, I think is going to be the new expectation," said John Fudenberg, executive director of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners and the former coroner of Las Vegas. "They did it, they proved that it works, and I think it will be the wave of the future because it\'s a lot more socially acceptable and more sensitive than temporary burial."How to find somewhere safe to store hundreds of bodies for long stretches was one of the hardest lessons in the first wave of the crisis -- one that hospitals, funeral directors and the city medical examiner\'s office are reviewing as the second wave of COVID-19 grows in New York.Last week, officials said that public hospitals in the city had canceled elective surgeries in order to save space for the growing numbers of COVID patients. COVID-19 deaths in the city are averaging about 35 per day, up from an average of fewer than 10 per day in early November.For now, a repeat as severe as the spring appears unlikely, given improvements in care and the arrival of the vaccine, the medical examiner and hospital officials said recently. Hospitals are reporting that their internal morgues, which tend to hold an average of 15 bodies, were about 25% full in mid-December, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association, which tracks that data. Funeral directors are not yet reporting backlogs."In planning, we are always ready for the worst-case scenario, and I feel confident that we are ready for that," said Dr. Barbara Sampson, the city\'s chief medical examiner. "But my expectation is that we will not be in the kind of place that we were in the spring. I hope that with all my heart."Still, normally about 150 people a day die per day in the city, so adding even an extra 100 deaths a day as a result of COVID-19 is likely to stress the system, several funeral directors said."There\'s just a real sense of dread, this kind of pall hanging over us," said Patrick Kearns, who operates three funeral homes in Queens and one on Long Island and retained his own refrigerated trailer after the first wave, just in case. "We have spent a lot of time getting supplies and setting up facilities. The position we are in now is kind of anticipation."Over the last few months, the city has required each hospital to redraw its fatality management plans, designating surge staff for morgues, parking spots for multiple 53-foot trailers and teams to handle paperwork and counsel families. Some hospitals have prebuilt ramps to access the trailers, 100 of which now wait in depots. The medical examiner has distributed thousands of heavy-duty body bags.But the facility that will most make the difference in the event of mass casualties, Sampson and others said, is the marine terminal, a city-owned concrete expanse at the end of 39th Street in Sunset Park.After the Sept. 11 attacks, the city\'s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner sifted rubble for human remains at the pier\'s warehouses. This time, the medical examiner, with assistance from the federal government, reopened the site April 14 as a temporary disaster morgue for hospital deaths, days after announcing it would stop temporary burials of unclaimed bodies on Hart Island.Video captured by drones of mass graves being dug on the island in early April had shocked the city. Families, terrified of that fate, implored hospitals to keep bodies longer, increasing the crush there, hospital officials said.On April 28, the city opened the long-term freezer storage facility at the Brooklyn pier, which can hold at least 1,500 bodies. (The city declined to provide a precise capacity)."That was a real game changer," said Jenna Mandel-Ricci, co-author of a Greater New York Hospital Association report on fatality management that documented lessons learned in the crisis. "I hope that we don\'t need it, but knowing that it\'s there and knowing that it\'s part of the framework that has been built is incredibly comforting."At the peak of the crisis, federal disaster workers and the New York National Guard helped to process and store thousands of bodies at Disaster Morgue 4, as the marine terminal was named. By the end of May, the pier held a total of 2,137 bodies -- 1,468 in long-term storage and 669 in refrigerated trailers, the medical examiner\'s office said.As of Dec. 4, the city\'s facility at the marine terminal still held 529 bodies in long-term storage and 40 in refrigerated trailers. (The Wall Street Journal first reported that bodies were still being held at the facility.)The city has not set a time limit on how long a body can remain there, as long as there are discussions underway with the family for a final resting place. The service is free, Sampson said.She said that those held in long-term storage there in December were a mixture of COVID-19 and non-COVID fatalities, which have continued to arrive at the terminal since May. The site, she said, is alleviating the strain on her office\'s regular morgues, which can hold 900 bodies, and also provides a central place for funeral directors to retrieve remains.Burials at Hart Island have not stopped, however. This year, 2,225 adults have been buried in the city cemetery there, the most in decades, according to the city\'s Department of Correction. Now burials there take place either at family request or because the bodies remained unidentified or unclaimed after an investigation of roughly two months, the medical examiner said.Officials have made adjustments based on what they learned in the spring. During the first wave, shelves were placed inside the trailers at hospitals to double their storage capacity. But they were unstable and at risk of collapsing if the trailers were moved. So the city sent strike teams of National Guard and medical examiner staff to hospitals to collect more than 2,000 bodies and bring them to the pier.This time, the medical examiner has told hospitals not to install shelves so trailers can be towed full to the pier, increasing efficiency and decreasing the possibility that the city could lose track of a body."After what we have all been through, with losing jobs and losing loved ones, the only thing that could make all of this worse is if the OCME or the funeral director has the wrong decedent," Sampson said. "I will not allow that to happen."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The microphone cover was also changed after each question and journalists were given the cover they used to take home in a little plastic bag.

(NYSE: PFE)  received  the greenlight for its vaccine against the coronavirus, the Food and Drug Administration cleared a similar vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, from Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA).What Happened: The FDA authorized the emergency use of mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 in individuals 18 years and older, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biopharma said in a late Friday statement.It is the second vaccine candidate approved conditionally in the U.S. It belongs to the new class of vaccines called messenger RNA vaccines. It contain a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\' mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus\' distinctive "spike" protein. Once vaccinated, the body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease but triggers the immune system to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.The decision was in line with  expectations  following a positive FDA committee review that favored approval by a vote of 20-0, with one abstention.Deliveries to the U.S. government will begin immediately, the company said."We were able to create and manufacture the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in 11 months from sequence to authorization, while advancing clinical development with a Phase 1, Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 study of 30,000 participants," said Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, in a statement.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, "With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of COVID-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States each day."Related Link:  Sarepta, Amicus Top Biotech Picks Ahead Of Key Binary Events: Analyst The Logistics and Distribution:  Given Moderna\'s vaccine was covered under the U.S. government\'s Operation Warp Speed, the Department of Defense, along with the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will manage allocation and distribution of the vaccine in the U.S.Prioritization will be determined by the CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Moderna said.The company expects to deliver 20 million doses to the U.S. government by the end of the month, and have another 100 million to 125 million doses available globally by in the first quarter of 2021. About 85 million to 100 million doses of the first-quarter availability will be supplied to the U.S. government, it added.What\'s Next:  Moderna said it will continue to gather additional data and look ahead to file a biologics license application with the FDA, requesting full licensure in 2021.Moderna\'s shares, which ended Friday\'s session down 2.62% at $140.23, advanced 2.24% to $143.37 in the after-hours session.

Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general under Obama, will reportedly return to his role with more responsibilities, and Biden\'s coronavirus advisory board co-chair Marcella Nunez-Smith will get a special role focused on health disparities.Zients "isn\'t a health care guru, and he\'s the first to say that," one source close to Biden told Politico. But his managerial experience is seen as an asset as the U.S. prepares to roll out a vaccine and combat the coronavirus-induced economic crisis — "he\'s essentially playing that role with the transition now," the source said. Zients will reportedly be paired with health experts including Murthy, who has already been a part of Biden\'s coronavirus plans. Nunez-Smith, a Yale University associate professor of medicine, will meanwhile help address how COVID-19 and other health care issues disproportionately affect people of color.The left wing of the Democratic party isn\'t expected to be thrilled with Zients\' selection, The New York Times reports. Progressive groups such as Revolving Door Project and Justice Democrats have already pointed out his corporate record, and the fact that an anesthesia company managed under the investment firm Zients ran had poor reviews. Under Obama, "his role was essentially to be a management consultant for the executive branch: cutting costs, finding efficiencies and looking at things like a businessman," Revolving Door said in a document about Zients\' background.More stories from theweek.com  5 absurdly funny cartoons about Trump\'s desperate fraud claims  Biden says he\'s concerned about reports Trump is considering preemptive pardons  Trump administration pushes ahead with sale of oil and gas leases in Alaska wildlife refuge', 'num_of_covid': 2}

He�s been gearing up for his latest impeachment trial, he�s been deprived of many of his toys and privileges that came with the presidency, and he�s suffering from boredom. But he�s also been basking in the comfort of knowing that the Republican Party will�even today�continue to bend over backwards to please him.But some of his most hardcore associates and advisers, who egged Trump on and helped fuel his most dangerous or destructive attempts to subvert American democracy, aren�t doing so well. In the three months since the election was called for Joe Biden, most of the lawyers and MAGA enthusiasts who decided to play a consequential role in the ex-president�s efforts to overturn the Democratic nominee�s 2020 win (efforts that led directly to the Jan. 6 mob violence), have had their jobs or businesses shredded, their personal lives shaken, or their reputations irrevocably tarnished�all while Trump�s been relaxing and playing his rounds of golf in the Sunshine State.The ones who helped spearhead the most extreme chapters in the broader crusade to nullify the election outcome are now besieged by their own legal battles. Several of them have complained that friends aren�t talking to them anymore, or have huffed and fumed over Twitter banning them for life for spreading dangerous misinformation. Several of the Trump-allied attorneys are just trying to hold onto their law licenses, under calls for disbarment for their participation on the Team Trump efforts. Only two of these people responded to requests for comment on this story.Much of their current ruin came as a direct result of their decisions to become major players in Trump�s failed authoritarian endeavor to cling to power. All of them have refused to admit that Trump, in fact, lost fair and square. Of this band of MAGA allies (which most prominently included people like Rudy Giuliani, Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, Lin Wood, Jenna Ellis, Cleta Mitchell, John Eastman, and Peter Navarro), arguably none of them has lost more in the time since the election than Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and personal friend of the ex-president�s.When Trump was in power, Lindell served as Trump 2020�s Minnesota co-chair and as a big financial backer of several efforts to overturn Biden�s win. He was welcomed by Trump into the Oval Office in the very last days of the term to brief the then-leader of the free world on a stack of documents purporting to show evidence that China and other foreign nations somehow tipped the election to Biden. (One of the papers in that packet included a suggestion for declaring martial law to bar the Democratic president-elect from office.)Today, as many of his former compatriots have already given up the fight, Lindell has continued to be the truest of believers in the cause, refusing to move on despite losing business left and right. Last week, Lindell texted The Daily Beast that Mattress Firm, which he described as a �big bedding company... if not the biggest,� had �quit selling MyPillow, too,� following a trend of companies swearing off the pillow mogul�s products after his post-election activity. Last month, the MyPillow creator said he�d already gotten phone calls or notices from Bed Bath & Beyond, Wayfair, and Kohl�s that they�d decided to ditch his product line and halt their business relationship with the MAGA super-fan�s company.MyPillow Chief�s Apocalyptic Election Fraud Epic Falls FlatThis month, Lindell and his pillow company also suffered a similar fate to the 45th president of the United States: Twitter had taken action against their accounts for spreading pro-Trump conspiracy theories baselessly claiming a rigged election. �They took down MyPillow�s Twitter now! Attacks keep coming,� Lindell lamented to The Daily Beast.Lindell is still facing a possible lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, the election tech company that has sent warnings to various people in the Trump orbit and in conservative media, demanding retractions and public apologies for making widespread allegations that Dominion helped steal the 2020 election. Other Trump stalwarts who�ve been sent demand letters have backed off, immediately gone quiet, or sheepishly issued on-air correctives.But not Lindell.Instead, the pillow entrepreneur claims to have gone into hiding, surrounding himself with ex-Special Forces soldiers. On Friday, Lindell released �Absolute Proof,� a three-hour video premiering on the Trump-aligned One America News Network that he claims will prove the election was stolen from Trump. Lindell cast the video�s release in apocalyptic terms, claiming on a North Dakota radio show shortly before the Friday release that the �end times� await if his video doesn�t catch on with �all the marbles on the line,� and that �I\'m serious, this is biblical. This is Revelations. This is Mark of the Beast stuff. This is that vaccine and all that garbage."Down in Georgia, Lin Wood isn�t doing that much better. During the tumultuous Trump-Biden presidential transition, Lindell financially supported Wood�s legal work as he made a name for himself with his especially groundless, violence-endorsing assertions about the election. The then-president would repeatedly phone Wood in late 2020 to get updates on his latest moves in Georgia. But Wood�s operation, working in tandem with Powell, caused rampant anxiety among conservatives on Capitol Hill, inside the Trump administration, and in the campaign. Many Republican operatives and lawmakers still, in part, blame Wood for helping to blow the GOP�s chances in this year�s Georgia runoff, costing the party control of the U.S. Senate at the dawn of the Biden era.But in the time since he seemingly struck up a rapport with Trump, the now-former president has privately bad-mouthed Wood as a crank to close associates, according to two people who�ve heard Trump�s criticisms. Today, Wood�s Twitter account, too, has been taken away from him, and it�s not clear whether Wood will even get to remain a lawyer for much longer.Nick Sandmann, the former Covington Catholic student whose lawsuits against media outlets had turned Wood into a star with Trump supporters, dropped Wood as his attorney. Wood recently doxxed his own son, publishing his estranged adult son�s email address online and urging his fans to contact him about the �persecution� the elder Wood faced. The Georgia state bar wants Wood to undergo a mental evaluation if he�s going to retain his license to practice law, according to Wood�s posts on social networking app Telegram, and a private lawyers club in Atlanta warned Wood he could face expulsion if he doesn�t resign his membership. Now Wood, one of the most outspoken promoters of the claim that Democrats committed voter fraud in 2020, is reportedly under investigation himself for voting in Georgia after sending an email that suggested he has another residency in South Carolina.Among this Trumpian collective of would-be election-destroyers, Wood isn�t even the only one whose license to practice law is now under attack or scrutiny.Powell, Wood�s partner-in-mischief, was slammed last month by Detroit officials who said they want her stripped of her Michigan law license. �This lawsuit, and the lawsuits filed in the other states, are not just damaging to our democratic experiment, they are also deeply corrosive to the judicial process itself,� attorneys for the Motor City wrote to U.S. District Judge Linda Parker.Following the Jan. 6 riot in Washington�the day Giuliani spoke at the D.C. rally and called for �trial by combat��the New York State Bar Association moved to expel the once-celebrated New York City mayor, and laid some of the blame for the mob violence at his door. Giuliani, who was the ringleader of Trump�s official election-challenging legal �strike force,� decried the move as a �political act.�Lin Wood Says He Must Take Mental Exam to Keep Law LicenseAround the same time, Brad Hoylman, the Democratic chairman of the New York state Senate Judiciary Committee, delivered a formal request to have Trump�s personal lawyer�s license to practice law revoked due to his �participation and role in fomenting a violent insurrectionist attack.�And like so many in the former president�s good graces who promulgated the pro-Trump lies about the 2020 election, Powell and Giuliani are facing aggressive legal threats from voting tech companies. On Thursday, Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion suit against several Fox stars, Giuliani, and Powell. "We have no choice," Antonio Mugica, Smartmatic�s founder, told CNN. "The disinformation campaign that was launched against us is an obliterating one. For us, this is existential, and we have to take action."But after Biden�s Jan. 20 inauguration, Giuliani at least continued to have the ear of his client, still the Republican Party�s most popular figure, by far. According to two people familiar with the matter, Giuliani kept informally advising Trump on impeachment-trial strategy, even after it was made clear to the attorney that he wouldn�t be officially serving on the ex-president�s new legal defense for the February Senate proceedings.Other lawyers who worked for Trump during the disastrous presidential transition weren�t so lucky, having been used and discarded by the former president�s political operation, and today left without their other jobs.Early last month, The Washington Post first revealed that Cleta Mitchell was intimately involved with Trump�s scandalous pressure campaign to overturn Biden�s victory in Georgia. She had, mostly under the radar, risen to become Team Trump�s point person in the state, and was on the now-infamous conference call between the Republican president and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.Over many years, Mitchell had earned a reputation as one of the conservative legal universe�s heaviest hitters, and a top-tier campaign finance attorney for right-leaning activists and political candidates. She was a true star in the field. But when her involvement in Trump�s efforts were revealed in January, her high-powered law firm, Foley & Lardner LLP, released a statement claiming it was unaware of the extent of Mitchell�s pro-Trump activity, and said the firm was �concerned� and probing the matter. Shortly thereafter, Mitchell was out of the job.Trump�s New �Volunteer� Lawyer Specializes in Election B.S.In December, John Eastman represented Trump before the U.S. Supreme Court when few others�even longtime Trump attorneys�would do so. On the then-president�s behalf, Eastman�a Chapman University law professor who became an outrage-magnet during the 2020 election for openly questioning Sen. Kamala Harris�s citizenship and therefore eligibility to serve as Biden�s running mate�asked the Supreme Court to allow Trump to intervene in a Texas suit that sought to cancel Biden�s victory in four key states.This legal maneuver, predictably, went nowhere fast. For his time and service, Eastman was rewarded by Trump by having his name floated as a possible member of his legal team for the second Senate trial. Eastman also got a prime speaking slot at the D.C. rally that preceded the bloody riot on Capitol Hill. However, Eastman and Giuliani were soon barred from working on the team, with several top Trump advisers fearing the pair wasn�t serious enough and that they carried too much riot-related baggage with them.The week after the rioting, Eastman was forced to resign from Chapman, following mounting pressure on the university�s leadership. The separation was acrimonious enough that both Eastman and the university had to pledge not to sue one another. �Chapman and Dr. Eastman have agreed not to engage in legal actions of any kind, including any claim of defamation that may currently exist, as both parties move forward,� Chapman president Daniele Struppa said in a statement at the time.As for the rest, Jenna Ellis, one of the most gung-ho of Trump�s senior legal advisers, is no longer representing the former president. Starting in early December, she and other Trumpist lawyers suffered a sharp plunge in the frequency of appearances on Fox News and Fox Business, following legal threats made by the voting-tech companies. But at least she still has her job as special counsel for the socially conservative Thomas More Society, and hasn�t lost her Twitter account of nearly 800,000 followers. Nowadays, she can be found tweeting her continued support of the former president, broadsides against the Biden administration, and her thoughts on issues such as why conservative women are definitely �hotter.�Peter Navarro, President Trump�s top trade adviser in the White House who spent Trump�s final weeks in office compiling and promoting documents that falsely portrayed massive election fraud, is still trying to talk to his former boss�through the TV, at least. On Friday, Navarro appeared on Newsmax TV to urge Trump to once again upturn his legal team. "You get somebody like Matt Gaetz as your lead attorney instead of that stiff [Bruce Castor] you had on," Navarro recommended� before touting his own research. �Then you use the �Navarro Report� and other reports that have been put out as your exhibits A, B, C, and D.�With the Trump presidency in his rearview mirror, multiple close associates of Navarro say they aren�t sure what his next career move will be, as he�s so inextricably tied himself to his onetime boss.As for Michael Flynn, Trump�s first national security adviser, he never got his reinstatement or re-elevation in the Trump administration that he and the ex-president had once so desired. In late November, he did, however, finally get his pardon from Trump for his role in the Robert Mueller saga. But in return, Flynn failed to deliver on the authoritarian push to keep Biden out of power, and (thankfully) didn�t have enough powerful takers for his pitch for Trump to proclaim martial law or use the U.S. military to �re-run� the election in electorally crucial states. With his professional reputation in Washington and elsewhere dramatically diminished, he now has to settle for being a folk hero to QAnon kooks.Chris Wallace Pokes Holes in Rand Paul�s Impeachment DefenseDown in Palm Beach, Florida, where the twice-impeached 45th president of the United States is prepping with his team for the Senate trial, he�s sometimes letting his boredom with retirement show, even as he tries to project a state of contentment to the public and to his aides. Late last week, Trump�s lawyers and advisers rejected an invitation from House impeachment managers for the former commander in chief to testify. �The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding,� senior Trump adviser Jason Miller flatly told The Daily Beast.When Trump hasn�t been focusing on his upcoming trial, he�s been golfing. He�s still binging his right-wing media and cable-TV favorites, though even there he�s starting to lose close friends due to the election aftermath. On Friday, the staunchly Trumpy Fox Business announced it had canceled the show of its star, Lou Dobbs, a fervent supporter of the former president who for years also doubled as a key informal adviser to Trump. (Dobbs had been mentioned in Smartmatic�s $2.7 billion lawsuit the day prior.) After the news broke, Trump voiced his support for Dobbs in an official statement, but by Saturday, Dobbs was keeping mostly tight-lipped about the ouster, texting The Daily Beast, �Sorry. No comment at this time.�When Trump is not watching television or monitoring line-up developments, he still hasn�t bothered devoting an ounce of introspection on the massive body counts and the ravaged nation he left for others to clean up. �He doesn�t have regrets about it, none that I�ve heard,� said one Trump confidant. He�s been scribbling down potential disses and harangues at his political foes, insults that he now cannot tweet himself to the broader public. He�s dictated petulant remarks sent to the Hollywood elites at the Screen Actors Guild who don�t want him anymore.In recent days, Trump has been phoning close associates regularly about the next impeachment trial�as well as to gossip about Biden, media, the future, and other members of the GOP. His office has also been messaging friends and high-profile allies on his behalf, inviting them to visit him at Mar-a-Lago, according to two knowledgeable sources and written communications reviewed by The Daily Beast.Some individuals close to the ex-president say he�s started getting lonely and bored with his existence out of power, and misses being constantly surrounded by powerful sycophants and being the center of attention for the news media, U.S. politicos, and leaders abroad. But the ex-president is still living in luxury, and has been recently very confident about his continued standing and influence in the Republican Party and conservative movement.And he�s not the only veteran of the sprawling, anti-democratic effort to be sitting pretty in early 2021.Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne became one of the strangest characters of the last days of the Trump administration, visiting the White House in December, dressed in jeans and a hoodie, scarfing down meatballs, and bickering with Trump�s legal team and administration officials, as he, Flynn, and Powell together pitched the then-president on their democracy-thwarting schemes. But now, with Trump�s dream of overturning the 2020 election in tatters, Byrne appears to be doing comparatively okay�and is blaming just about everyone else for President Biden�s win, turning his blog into the digital burn book of the Trump post-campaign. �Almost every evening, and many early afternoons, Rudy was shit-faced,� Byrne blogged recently. �That, and his podcasts, were the only guarantees in Rudy�s life.� (Byrne declined to comment on this story, saying he wanted to finish his blog series first.)However thoroughly Byrne was dragging Giuliani and others for their alleged behavior, the Trump attorney didn�t seem to care too much. Asked on Saturday what he thought about Byrne bashing him, Giuliani simply replied to The Daily Beast, �So have you,� without further explaining how this news outlet had �trashed� him lately.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) just once again clashed during a COVID-19 hearing. This time, as Fauci testified before lawmakers on Thursday, Paul while questioning him claimed it\'s "just theater" for those who have had COVID-19 or received their vaccine to still wear a mask, an assertion that drew pushback from the nation\'s top infectious disease expert. "Here we go again with the theater," Fauci said. "Let\'s get down to the facts." Fauci went on to point to the spread of COVID-19 variants, which he called a "good reason for a mask," and he told Paul that he\'s "not hearing what I\'m saying about variants" as the senator continued to argue there\'s no evidence people should need to wear masks after recovering from COVID-19 or getting a vaccine. CDC guidance states that those who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should still wear a mask in public. "You\'ve been vaccinated and you parade around in two masks for show," Paul told Fauci. An exasperated Fauci rejected that claim, telling Paul, "Let me just state for the record masks are not theater" and adding that "I totally disagree" with what he said. This was the latest clash between the two during a congressional hearing. In September, Fauci blasted Paul during a hearing for "not listening" to what health officials had been saying, adding that the senator "misconstrued" what he had said has "done that repetitively in the past." Sen. @RandPaul: "If we\'re not spreading the infection, isn\'t it just theater? You have the vaccine and you\'re wearing two masks, isn\'t that theater?

{'_id': '01401484cf160134f40e8f8840517d81', 'title': 'Biden Team, Pushing Quick Stimulus Deal, Prepares for Renewed Recession', 'description': 'WASHINGTON -- Advisers to President-elect Joe Biden are planning for the increasing likelihood that the United States economy is headed for a "double-dip" recession early next year. They are pushing for Democratic leaders in Congress to reach a quick stimulus deal with Senate Republicans, even if it falls short of the larger package Democrats have been seeking, according to people familiar with the discussions.Until now, Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader, have insisted that Republicans agree to a spending bill of $2 trillion or more, while Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, wants a much smaller package. The resulting impasse has threatened to delay additional economic aid until after Biden\'s inauguration on Jan. 20.Many of the president-elect\'s advisers have become convinced that deteriorating economic conditions from the renewed surge in COVID-19 infections and the looming threat of millions of Americans losing jobless benefits in December amid a wave of evictions and foreclosures require more urgent action before year\'s end. That could mean moving at least part of the way toward McConnell\'s offer of a $500 billion package.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBut top Democrats remain publicly adamant that Republicans need to move closer to their opening offer of $2.4 trillion. Biden, Pelosi and Schumer have given no public indication of how much they are willing to scale back their ambitions in order to reach a deal with McConnell, arguing that the Republican leader has not been willing to compromise."The COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession will not end without our help," Pelosi and Schumer wrote in a letter this month, asking McConnell to resume negotiations. "It is essential that this bill have sufficient funding and delivers meaningful relief to the many Americans who are suffering."Biden\'s team is also considering a range of other policy options for fighting a renewed downturn and the prospect of rising unemployment when he takes office, according to the people familiar with his plans. Some of them, like a sweeping spending bill that includes all or large parts of his campaign proposals for infrastructure, could depend on Democrats winning Senate control in two special elections in Georgia in January.Others would not require Congress. Biden\'s aides have weighed having the president-elect announce in the coming weeks that he will sign executive orders on his first day in office extending moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures, and deferrals of some student loan payments that are set to expire at the end of the year, the people familiar with the discussions said. He could also announce that he will sign an order providing a more gradual schedule for repayment of payroll taxes that some employers, including the federal government, had deferred into 2021 under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump.Such orders could lessen or avoid an economic cliff of expiring protections for renters, homeowners and some borrowers, which experts fear could hasten an economic contraction.The Biden team is also exploring how to circumvent a last-minute move by the Trump administration to end Federal Reserve lending programs that have helped stabilize markets by requiring the central bank to return hundreds of billions of dollars to the Treasury Department, according to the people familiar with the discussions. One possibility would be for Biden\'s Treasury to reissue that money to the Fed under new parameters meant to encourage more aid to small and medium-sized businesses than previously supplied.But the most important measure could be quick congressional approval of a stimulus bill."There needs to be emergency assistance and aid during the lame-duck session to help families, to help small business," Jen Psaki, a Biden transition aide, said Friday before a meeting with Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Pelosi and Schumer. "There\'s no more room for delay, and we need to move forward as quickly as possible."A readout from the meeting said Biden and the other Democrats "agreed that Congress needed to pass a bipartisan emergency aid package in the lame-duck session" but did not indicate what size package was warranted.The economy returned to growth in the second half of this year after falling into a sharp and rapid recession. But sluggish retail sales growth in October, rising claims for unemployment insurance last week and a multiweek decline in employment and hours worked at small businesses nationwide have increased the odds that the economy could tip back into recession."The pandemic is raging, and it\'s starting to do damage again," said Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody\'s Analytics.Economists close to Biden and his campaign are circulating a spreadsheet containing new projections from Zandi, which predict that the economy will begin to shrink again in the first half of next year unless lawmakers break a prolonged impasse in stimulus talks.Such a reversal would result in what economists call a double-dip recession, even as pharmaceutical companies prepare to distribute COVID-19 vaccines that lawmakers and economists hope will curb the pandemic and jolt the economy back toward rapid growth late next year or in 2022. Companies would shed 3 million jobs in the first half of 2021, Zandi projected, and the unemployment rate would climb from its current rate of 6.9% back to nearly 10%.Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was part of Biden\'s inner circle of economic aides in the campaign, said that "speed, size and composition are all important" in a stimulus agreement, "but speed is especially important."A dispute over the size of the package has stalled talks for months. Democrats have rejected multiple Senate Republican proposals -- the latest at about $500 billion -- as insufficient to address the economy\'s needs, particularly because they do not include money for state and local governments to plug budget holes and avoid public-sector layoffs. Zandi said that such a package "maybe barely gets you through to a vaccine" but risks running out when the economy still needs help.Several Republicans have expressed wariness about spending much more, revisiting concerns about the national debt and insisting that the economy is improving."We want to reach agreement on all the areas where compromise is well within reach, send hundreds of billions of dollars to urgent and uncontroversial programs, and let Washington argue over the rest later," McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor this week, deriding the Democratic offer. "By playing all-or-nothing hardball with a proposal this radical, our colleagues have thus far guaranteed that American workers and families get nothing at all."The legislative window before the start of the next Congress in January is quickly tightening, leaving many skeptical that a stimulus package could be passed before the end of the year. Most of the discussion around spending has centered on avoiding a government shutdown and approving the necessary dozen annual spending bills. About one week of scheduled legislative days remain, during which lawmakers will need to pass legislation to fund the government beyond Dec. 11. It is unclear whether either chamber will remain in Washington if that deadline is met, particularly when Capitol Hill is struggling to stem the spread of the coronavirus among the rank and file.Economists are increasingly stressing the need for lawmakers to act quickly, even if that means reaching agreement on smaller package. A bipartisan group convened by the Aspen Institute\'s Economic Strategy Group -- including former Treasury secretaries under Democratic and Republican administrations -- urged lawmakers Thursday to approve a package that includes aid to small businesses, individuals and state and local governments, saying the economy "cannot wait until 2021" for relief."What I\'m really worried about is the millions of people who are going to be without food or without a home during the winter," said Melissa S. Kearney, the economist who directs the strategy group. "That level of individual suffering, really, to me, should be everyone\'s priority and move them past their political differences."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '857138482cdc0f0087010d76f69982cb', 'title': 'Extreme Cold Killed Texans in Their Bedrooms, Vehicles and Backyards', 'description': 'SAN ANTONIO — Carrol Anderson spent much of his life in southeast Texas, where the most feared natural disasters spin up from the Gulf of Mexico during the warm months of hurricane season. But last week, Anderson, a 75-year-old who breathed with the help of oxygen tanks, knew that a different kind of storm was heading his way. To prepare, he ordered a fresh supply of oxygen that his stepdaughter said never arrived. There was a spare tank, however, in the pickup outside his one-story brick house in Crosby, Texas, just northeast of Houston. So when Anderson, an Army veteran who went by Andy, was found dead inside his truck Tuesday, his stepdaughter figured he had gone outside to retrieve it. His main tank, back in the house, runs on electricity, and the power had gone out the night before as a deadly cold descended on much of Texas. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times While the final tally could be much higher, Anderson was among at least 58 people who died in storm-affected areas stretching to Ohio, victims of carbon monoxide poisoning, car crashes, drownings, house fires and hypothermia. In Galveston County, along the Texas Gulf Coast, the authorities said two residents had died from exposure to the cold and one person from possible carbon monoxide poisoning. Four other deaths remained under investigation and were possibly linked to the frigid weather. County Judge Mark Henry, the county’s top elected official, said he would have evacuated some of his most vulnerable residents before the winter storm had he known that power outages would plunge the county into darkness for a few days. He said the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state’s power grid, had warned only of rolling blackouts. Instead, most residents were without power for at least 48 hours. “We would have been happy to order an evacuation if we’d been told Sunday the power was going to go out and stay out for four days,” he said, noting the county is more accustomed to ordering evacuations before hurricanes. A spokeswoman for ERCOT said Friday that the surge in demand stressed the power grid, a crisis so dire that the “local utilities were not able to rotate the outages.” At its height, about 4 million Texans were without power this week as temperatures plummeted to the teens and single digits. About 165,000 remained without electricity on Friday, though millions were still without running water or under notices to boil their tap water. Still, there were signs of relief. In hard-hit Austin, City Manager Spencer Cronk said Friday that more than 1 million gallons of water would arrive over the next two days. The city plans to set up distribution centers, and Cronk said water would be delivered to the city’s most vulnerable citizens, such as older people and those without homes. Greg Meszaros, the director of Austin’s water utility, said he expected that most residents would have their water pressure restored over the weekend. Boil water advisories should be lifted sometime next week, he said. Coming into clearer view were the dimensions of a public health crisis exacerbated by poverty, desperation and, in some cases, a lack of understanding of cold-weather safety. Texas hospitals and health providers saw more than 700 visits related to carbon monoxide poisoning between Monday and Wednesday. Thayer Smith, division chief with the Austin Fire Department, said his city had seen dozens of incidents of toxic exposure from people burning charcoal in their homes. The weather also hampered the response to the coronavirus pandemic. The White House on Friday said 6 million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been held up because of snowstorms across the country, creating a backlog affecting every state and throwing off the pace of vaccination appointments over the next week. In Texas, hospitals spent the week grappling with burst pipes, power outages and acute water shortages, making it difficult to care for patients. In Abilene, authorities said a man died at the Hendrick Medical Center after he was unable to get dialysis treatment at the site. Large amounts of filtered water, in addition to electricity and heat, are required to properly provide care for dialysis patients, and water at the hospital was shut down, said Cande Flores, the Abilene fire chief. Flores said that at least four people had died in Abilene as a result of the state power grid failure, including a homeless man who died from exposure to the cold, a 60-year-old man who was found dead in his home and an 86-year-old woman whose daughter found her frozen in her backyard. Elsewhere in the state, a 69-year-old man was found dead inside his home in a rural community south of San Antonio, where he lived alone. He did not have electricity, and the authorities said his bedroom was 35 degrees when they found him. In Houston, an Ethiopian immigrant died in her idling car, which was parked in her garage, where she sat while charging her phone. The woman, Etenesh Mersha, was talking to a friend when she started to feel tired. “She tried to drink water,” said Negash Desta, a relative by marriage to Mersha. “After she told her friend she couldn’t talk anymore, there was no response after that.” The friend tried to call the police in Houston but did not have an address, Desta said. The friend turned to Facebook, where she found Desta. Hours later, he eventually received a message about what had happened and alerted the police. They found an entire family, poisoned. “When they get in, they found the mother and daughter were just dead and the son and father alive. They had all fainted,” he said, adding that the car had still been running. The daughter, Rakeb Shalemu, was 7 years old. Mersha’s husband and 8-year-old son were hospitalized. Desta said that the husband has since been released and that the boy, Beimnet Shalemu, was still in the intensive critical unit. Near Houston in Conroe, Texas, an 11-year-old boy, Cristian Pineda, was found dead in his bed on Monday morning. His family had no power the night before, and the parents, the boy and his siblings had huddled together in one bedroom, Lt. James Kelemen of the Conroe Police Department said Friday. Like Anderson and Mersha and her family, Cristian was the focus of a hastily assembled GoFundMe page. It requested donations to cover the expenses of his burial in Honduras, where his family is from. It had raised more than $38,000 as of Friday afternoon. The page showed a picture of a boy in a thin red hoodie, smiling and standing in the snow. On Tuesday, while Anderson’s wife was mopping up their living room after a frozen pipe burst, he walked to the garage to try to get a generator going, hoping he could help clean up with a Shop-Vac. His wife would not know until later that he had walked to his truck in search of oxygen, said his stepdaughter, Brandi Campanile. It was 19 degrees. His spare oxygen tank, it would turn out, was empty. “He was trying to get oxygen and it was just a losing battle,” Campanile said Friday. “Texas is not meant to handle freezing temperatures. It’s not something that happens out here.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 3}

That's according to two sources familiar with the deal, who said it's expected to be announced on Friday. The scheme was set up last year as a result of concerns that poorer nations would lose out as rich countries scrambled to secure COVID-19 vaccines for their citizens. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would be COVAX's second after AstraZeneca's. Details on the size of the deal or the price COVAX would pay were not immediately clear, but the sources said the allotment of doses would likely be relatively small.  One source says the limited doses are primarily meant for healthcare workers in COVAX countries. The Pfizer shot is also more complicated to transport and store, requiring ultra-cold freezers, which may not be practical for poorer countries with hot climates. Reuters reported Wednesday that the WHO plans to approve several more vaccines from Western and Chinese manufacturers in the coming weeks. In an updated forecast published on Thursday, COVAX said it planned to deliver nearly 2 billion doses to 92 countries this year, covering over a quarter of their populations. The COVAX scheme is set to start distributing COVID-19 vaccines next month. Ukraine said earlier on Thursday that its first delivery of some 210,000 doses under the COVAX scheme could arrive in the first half of February.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

Because we know there was massive fraud.”“Time isn’t on our side … this was a massive fraud, this should never take place in this country, we’re like a third-world country,” he said, suggesting that faulty vote-counting machines gave Biden millions of extra votes.Asked a second time if he would concede if the Electoral College votes for Biden, Trump responded, “Well if they do they made a mistake,” before saying it’s a “possibility” and scolding a reporter who pressed him on the issue: “Don’t talk to me that way, you’re just a lightweight.”Asked by another reporter if he would “leave this building” if the Electoral College elects Biden, he said, “Certainly, I will.”While Trump and his legal team have repeatedly looked to throw out votes in states that Joe Biden carried, none of their challenges have proved successful.Key states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia—all of which Trump carried in 2016, before flipping blue this year—certified their results this week, ensuring they will send a Democratic slate of voters to the Electoral College. Wisconsin and Arizona, two more states that flipped to Biden, are set to certify their results next week.“Massive fraud has been found. We’re like a third world country,” Trump said, before launching back into allegations of voter fraud that have been repeatedly rebuffed in court and by state election officials of both parties.“I did so well ... that they didn’t know what to do,” he said at one point of election results in Georgia, claiming that ballots for him were “thrown away.”“I don’t know what is going to happen. I know one thing, Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes. And I got 74 million but there were many ballots thrown away, so I got much more than that. But I got 74 million, 74 million is 11 million more than I got last time. … And it’s millions more than Hillary Clinton got.”Underneath all of the bravado, Trump at one point slipped up and blasted “the Biden administration,” apparently inadvertently recognizing Biden’s win.While Trump has refused to concede and maintained that somehow, he would win states he had already lost, his administration has relented behind the scenes.Earlier this week, Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administrations—a Trump appointee—signed off on a letter officially allowing the presidential transition to begin. Murphy had previously refused to do so, a partisan move from a historically non-partisan agency.Even Trump appeared to have a moment of clarity Thursday regarding a potential COVID-19 cure and his future (or lack thereof) in the White House.“Don’t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccine,” he said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': 'ccaed941dc9712f31e99ca16407fbb31', 'title': 'Florida Guv Gave Out VIP Vaccines. This Is Who Got Screwed.', 'description': 'Bryan R. Smith / AFP / GettyMIAMI—About three weeks ago, Jane McPherson put her name on a standby list of older folks seeking the COVID-19 vaccine from the health department in Manatee, a county of roughly 400,000 people on the gulf coast of Florida. That list swelled to nearly 158,000 senior citizens, and the 65-year-old resident of Bradenton, the county seat, is still waiting for her shot.“I’m stuck in the queue,” she told The Daily Beast, referring to the local vaccine lottery system. “No one has called me. I guess I need to pursue it harder.”Last week, McPherson tried signing up for a vaccine shot at her local Publix, the Lakeland, Florida-based grocery store chain that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration picked for an exclusive pilot program to inoculate seniors at hundreds of pharmacy locations statewide.Still no luck. Due to vaccine shipments being delayed by the brutal snowstorms that blanketed most of the U.S., Publix canceled booking windows for people to sign up for immunization appointments. In fact, Manatee County Commissioner Carol Whitmore told The Daily Beast that 5,100 doses the health department was supposed to receive last week were delayed.“The weather screwed things up,” McPherson said, dejectedly. “These are scary times.”COVID Would Kill Me. Too Bad I Live in a Vaccine Hellhole.But even as McPherson struggled to get an appointment, DeSantis funneled 3,000 extra doses to seniors residing in two targeted zip codes within Lakewood Ranch, a well-off residential community near Bradenton developed by the Uihlein family. The clan’s members include GOP and DeSantis megadonor Richard Uihlein, who gave $900,000 to the governor’s re-election effort in 2018 and 2019, according to the Florida Division of Elections. The Uihleins own Lakewood Ranch’s parent company Schroeder-Manatee Ranch, whose CEO Rex Jensen got a call from DeSantis about delivering the goods, as first reported by The Bradenton Herald. (A spokesperson for Schroeder-Manatee told the Sun-Sentinel Richard Uihlein was not himself a shareholder in the company.)Jensen then contacted Republican Manatee County Commission Chairwoman Vanessa Baugh to help set up the pop-up vaccine site, and she gave the final word on who would get the shots, according to local media reports. She even provided a VIP list to county staff that included herself, some of her friends, and Jensen.The governor’s decision has not gone over well–even among some of his supporters.“I did vote for him,” McPherson told The Daily Beast. “I would not vote for him again unless whoever runs against him is a worse person.”Indeed, a routine press conference last week touting the plan as another notch on the vaccine-fixated governor’s belt went south quickly. From a podium set up at the Lakewood Ranch outdoor pop-up clinic, DeSantis bristled at questions about complaints from residents who were upset he was giving shots to an exclusive group of people. (Residents of the two zip codes are some of the wealthiest people in the region, and have faced lower infection rates than some of their neighbors.)“If Manatee County doesn’t like us doing this, then we are totally fine with putting this in counties that want it and we’re totally happy to do that,” DeSantis barked. “So anyone that’s saying that, let us know, if you want us to send it to Sarasota next time or Charlotte or Pasco or wherever, let us know; we’re happy to do it.”It was the kind of snarky outburst DeSantis has hurled at reporters throughout a pandemic that has further endeared him to conservative voters in Florida. But the controversy swirling around the Lakewood Ranch vaccine debacle may cost him—even in Bradenton, a Republican-rich city that produced 124,827 votes for Donald Trump in 2020, roughly a 20 percent increase from his vote total there in 2016. DeSantis’ campaign of politically targeted vaccine distribution, throwing out lifelines to donors and allies even as he blocks localities from enforcing mask mandates, is alienating voters in a state where shots represent the only pandemic safety plan. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images “He was like a little kid stomping his feet,” McPherson told The Daily Beast of DeSantis’ press conference.Cindy Dunbar, an 84-year-old with a chronic pulmonary disease and a Republican who also voted for DeSantis in 2018, said the governor’s comments were “childish and irresponsible.” Like McPherson, Dunbar has been waiting for weeks for her name to be called, she said.“If he had extra vaccines, DeSantis should have given it to the people in the stand-by pool, not call a developer,” Dunbar told The Daily Beast. “The whole thing was a scheme to give it to wealthy residents.”Meanwhile, health experts warn that DeSantis is eroding public confidence in Florida’s vaccine rollout by seemingly rewarding individuals and companies who support him. Spokespersons for DeSantis did not respond to multiple email requests for comment for this story.In late December, DeSantis held a press conference at The Villages, the state’s largest retirement community that overwhelmingly tilts to the GOP. As part of the presser, five Republican Villagers who previously held elected office or positions within local GOP clubs received shots weeks before hundreds of their neighbors were able to get inoculated. In early January, DeSantis announced the pilot program in which Publix would exclusively administer vaccines after the grocer contributed $100,000 to Friends of DeSantis.DeSantis and Publix have denied any correlation between the partnership and the campaign contributions. But the mere perception of political favoritism can exacerbate the frustration of senior citizens who are trying to get vaccinated, University of South Florida infectious disease professor Dr. Jill Roberts told The Daily Beast. Many elderly people are already facing challenges with having internet access for making appointments and the need to have a vehicle to get to vaccination sites, Roberts added.“Favoritism continues to erode the public’s trust in the system which should be providing equality for all,” Roberts told The Daily Beast. “Obviously, vaccines should continue to go to those with the greatest need and never those with the greatest dollars.”Dr. Marissa Levine, another University of South Florida epidemiology scholar, said having an ethical framework around the logistics of distributing vaccines is critical for helping people and managing a difficult rollout. “In this case [involving Lakewood Ranch], there weren’t any ethics here and it was much more a matter of who you know,” Levine told The Daily Beast. “It would have been better for DeSantis to take those doses and put them back in the existing [lottery system]. That is the more equitable way.”Why Europe’s COVID Vaccine Passports Won’t WorkDuring a Thursday county commission meeting, Chairwoman Baugh apologized for her role in organizing the Lakewood Ranch pop-up site. She said she believed she was following the governor’s directions about selecting areas that had a high concentration of seniors when she picked the zip codes 34202 and 34211. Coincidentally, both zip codes are located in her district—two areas where the average median income is around $100,000, or double Manatee’s overall median income, according to The Bradenton Herald. Baugh overruled county staff’s suggestion to draw names at random from the standby list, but also insisted that she did not herself get the vaccine at Lakewood Ranch.“I also want to apologize to Gov. [Ron] DeSantis,” Baugh said at the meeting. “I don’t do that because I feel that I’m putting him in jeopardy because of Lakewood Ranch. I did exactly what he wanted. I am thankful and appreciate that he brought 3,000 additional doses to this county. That’s 3,000 more than we would’ve had.”Baugh did not respond to messages left on her cellphone, but County Commissioner Whitmore, also a Republican, said the governor did not deserve the brunt of the blame. “I don’t care what party I am in, I am embarrassed that this happened,” Whitmore told The Daily Beast. “Now, I have never spoken with the governor and I didn’t attend the press conference, but he was set up. Commissioner Baugh took full responsibility.”Whitmore, a registered nurse, said the DeSantis administration has ramped up the amount of doses Manatee received since mid-January after the county and the state health department opened a large vaccination site in Bradenton’s Bennett Park. Whitmore herself volunteers at the site preparing syringes, she said. According to the most recent update from the Florida Department of Health, 44,333 people have been vaccinated in Manatee County.“We were initially getting 1,500 doses a week and then it went up to 2,000,” Whitmore said. “In the past month, it’s gone up from 4,000 a week to 5,100. We have seen an increase without even asking.”Still, seniors like McPherson are stuck without a vaccine in a state where that may be the only hope for survival thanks to an officially sanctioned climate of pandemic rebellion.“I do everything I am supposed to do like wear my mask when I go out, wash my hands constantly, and avoid big groups,” she said. “I’ve lived here 50 years and I know people from out of state who have come here and gotten the vaccine. It pisses me off.”McPherson was impressed with DeSantis’ leadership during the first year of his term, but her faith in him fell apart during the pandemic.“At first, I thought he was doing a good job,” she said. “Now, I question some of his decisions. When he said he would send the vaccine to other places, I thought it was very juvenile of him. It was like his feelings got hurt. When you are governor, that is not how it is supposed to work.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': '8014ce21ac8ed33954d2bcbe8e0b59d5', 'title': 'To Stay or Go? Even With Vaccines, Travel Planning Remains Complicated', 'description': 'Kristin Botuchis booked the tickets last month, almost on impulse: two round-trip seats to London from Seattle for $1,200 in July — the perfect start to a dreamy European vacation that would include France, Italy and Greece. She found herself clicking through the Icelandic Air website and entering her information, “just to see what would happen.” “My husband was definitely caught off guard. He would never pick this time to travel,” she said, admitting she hadn’t done much research beforehand. “It was a little impulsive on my part.” Botuchis lives in Everett, Washington, with her husband and two children. She is turning 50 this year and celebrating her 20th wedding anniversary. She is also one of millions of Americans who, after a 2020 full of lockdowns and anxiety, are eager to get back to normal and back out into the world. But since that initial flush of possibility, of those daydreams of the French Riviera, Botuchis now worries that the pandemic realities of closed borders, quarantine requirements, uncertain vaccine access and her husband’s uneasiness will derail the trip from happening at all. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “I was trying to make this leap and make this dream trip happen,” she said. “But I started to realize that this may not be the trip I envisioned.” Welcome to the next phase of travel in a pandemic world: the post-vaccine era. Or maybe the mid-vaccine era is more accurate. Vaccine rollouts are bringing hope to travelers antsy to explore, as are scattered liftings of pandemic lockdowns nationally and around the world. But travel planning remains far from simple. Vaccine supply remains limited almost everywhere, distribution is confusing and questions remain regarding their efficacy in preventing transmission. Family members and friends may have different timelines for receiving a vaccine. On top of all that, news about the spread of variants is worrisome, and international travel remains head-scratchingly confusing with restrictions and testing requirements. (If Botuchis left tomorrow, she would not be able to enter France or Italy without proving an essential reason for her visit. Even if she opted to fly only to London, she would be required to quarantine for at least five days upon arrival.) And don’t forget that your favorite travel partner may have a different level of comfort regarding travel than you. Botuchis, who works with special-needs children, has already been vaccinated. Her husband, an industrial project manager, is not currently eligible. Taking a trip of any kind this summer might require her persuading him to take the risk, she said. “We both had COVID in November, but his case was much worse than mine,” she said. “He’s definitely more scared of the virus than I am. And he’s a little more cautious in general.” That, coupled with uncertainty around when he will receive a vaccine, makes her European trip a harder case for her to make. Vaccinated but Still Uncertain If the uncertainty of 2020 has taught us anything, it’s the unlikelihood that any travel that happens this year will be similar to the “normal” of pre-pandemic times. “Many of my colleagues in the travel industry are looking at the vaccine as a silver bullet to the situation,” said James Ferrara, president and co-founder of InteleTravel, a global host travel agency. “I don’t think that the science backs that yet.” Indeed, travel planning isn’t necessarily more straightforward for those who have already been vaccinated. Loren Riskin, an anesthesiologist based in San Francisco, was vaccinated in January. Riskin, 37, is largely basing her willingness to travel on the current state of the pandemic in California. “There’s some data to suggest that, if you’re vaccinated, you can still be an infectious carrier. And here in the Bay Area, we are still in a pretty dire place,” she said. “My travel plans, which right now are mostly daydreams, are much more based on what public health officials and leadership have said our system can tolerate, rather than my own direct risk.” (Currently, California’s state directives encourage residents to avoid nonessential travel and to self-quarantine for 10 days upon returning home.) Bill Jirsa and his wife, of Georgetown, Texas, are both fully vaccinated. Last fall, optimistic about the announcement of viable vaccines, Jirsa, 79, rebooked a land tour of Sicily, originally scheduled in 2020, for May. He also booked a cruise around the Caribbean and Brazil in the fall. Plus, there was an annual golf trip in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his brother and two friends. But receiving his second shot late last month didn’t provide the feeling of confidence and safety he had hoped for. “We’re just not comfortable with the current situation. Nobody can tell us that we can’t carry the virus and give it to someone else; no one knows for sure what the shots do with these new variants,” he said. “Nobody likes the unknown. So how can you plan when there’s so much you can’t plan for?” The couple has decided to, again, cancel all of their international travel plans, and received refunds for flights from Delta and Alitalia. Jirsa feels more comfortable with the idea of the Arizona golf trip, but his brother and friends are facing resistance from their families who have young children and are concerned about transmission of the virus. But the golf group is determined to play next year, if not this fall. “We don’t have that many years left when we are ambulatory, when we can do the kind of traveling that we like to do,” Jirsa said. “In 2022, we’re going to be 80 years old. I just don’t know what we’re going to be up for.” Hot Spots, Quarantines and Variants Vaccines are just one piece of the puzzle. Shifting hot spots and regularly changing state and country restrictions and testing requirements remain a concern for many would-be travelers. Stacey Burkert, who lives in Durham, North Carolina, her husband and their three teenage children traveled to Costa Rica in January — their first time flying since spring — in part because she felt less safe at home with the state’s rising case numbers. In Costa Rica, she and her family stayed in a villa that allowed them to be relatively isolated. Her children were able to continue remote schooling while away, too. The Burkerts are considering a family hiking trip in Europe this summer, but she’d like both the vaccine and more information before committing to those plans. “Even when I’m vaccinated, I’d still rather avoid areas that are a hot spot,” she said. “Our plans this summer will depend a lot on how Europe handles the virus.” Rebecca Williams, who lives in New York City, hopes to travel to Italy in August with her husband, daughter and newborn son. The trip had been canceled last year. Williams is 34 and her husband is 35; both are low-risk and will probably be one of the last groups vaccinated. While she is hopeful that they’ll be vaccinated by later this summer, she does not see the vaccine as a panacea. “Hopefully, we’ll be vaccinated. We’ll get a negative COVID test before we fly, and we’ll get one when we land if we need to,” she said. “We’ll rent a house so we have our own space; I imagine we’ll interact with the community less than we normally would.” For now, she’s looking at house rentals, but she plans on holding off on booking flights until this summer. With or without the vaccine, external factors mean that her long-awaited plans are far from certain. “We would have to cancel if a variant came out that was really dangerous for kids. Or if New York was in a state of lockdown. Or if a two-week quarantine was required at our destination; I’d have to reevaluate our timing.” It’s a lot. Not to mention that nonessential travel to Italy from the United States is currently prohibited. Changing rules around testing and mandatory quarantines have become something of a constant over the past year; now, there’s a possibility that either proof of vaccine or a vaccine passport could become a necessity. If travel planners learned anything in 2020, it is that the rapidity with which requirements can change, both state by state and country by country, can be dizzying. Botuchis expressed concern that, come summer, Americans will still be barred from entering much of the European Union without an essential reason. Even if she and her husband can enter the country, will quarantine requirements prevent them from actually seeing the place they’re visiting? And then there are changing requirements for reentering the United States. The latest virus hot spots seem to emerge just as quickly. An August trip to Italy — which is currently reporting tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases a day — might sound somewhat feasible now, but would quickly lose appeal if the country saw an even further surge. It’s a feeling of whiplash that Williams remembers all too well from 2020. “I remember saying last March, ‘Over my dead body will we cancel this trip! This will be over by Memorial Day!’” she said, referring to her 2020 travel plans. “Now, looking back on it, I can’t help but think, ‘Oh, Rebecca. Nope.’ ” Botuchis has a map pinned to her wall and guidebooks full of highlighted passages, but in the face of so much uncertainty, she has only booked that one round-trip flight to London. She hasn’t been able to bring herself to dig too deeply into cancellation and change policies. “If I’m not allowed in the country, they’ve got to give me my money back, right?” she said. “Or if they would give me a voucher so I could reschedule to next year … that would be OK.” Your Travel Plans: Subject to Change More flexible change policies may make it easier for some to pull the trigger and book, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s difficult to imagine what this summer will look like for travel. While it cannot be compared with the overwhelming loss of life and economic despair in the United States and elsewhere, the loss of travel over the past year has left a void for many. “We’re in a weird inflection point between the physical risks of a deadly disease and the mental risks of not being able to pursue the things you love,” Riskin said. The possibility of missing out on more adventures for an undefined period is a hard reality to consider. “I’m realizing how important travel, socializing and community really are,” Williams said. For Burkert, that uncertainty makes it incredibly difficult for her to even think too far ahead. “We used to plan our travel two years out. But I just have to keep the blinders on right now, because I can’t stand the letdown,” she said. “Even this Europe trip. It makes me nervous to talk about July! There’s this possible disappointment that I don’t want to deal with.” Riskin is heartened that numbers in California are steadily improving. The possibility of traveling further afield is a promise she’s holding onto to continue getting through a particularly challenging year. Her dream trip is a multiday scuba-diving trip on a boat, something that the vaccine at least allows her to consider again. But she’s not booking anything yet. “We need to rely on public health experts and epidemiologists and the people who have access to the bigger picture,” she said. “But as soon as they give me the go-ahead, I am going to go see some fish.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, with impaired breathing and drops in blood pressure that usually occur within minutes or even seconds after exposure to a food or medicine, or even a substance like latex to which the person is allergic.Both workers were treated and have recovered, the regulators said.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesBritish authorities have since clarified their concerns, changing the wording from "severe allergic reactions" to specify that the vaccine should not be given to anyone who has ever had an anaphylactic reaction to a food, medicine or vaccine. That type of reaction to a vaccine is "very rare," they said.Their update also said that a third patient had a "possible allergic reaction" but did not describe it.Officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that because of the British cases they would require Pfizer to increase its monitoring for anaphylaxis and submit data on it once the vaccine comes into use. A panel of expert advisers to the FDA voted Thursday to recommend authorizing the vaccine for emergency use but also expressed concerns about the need to track anaphylaxis. The agency usually accepts the experts\' recommendations, and the authorization is expected within days. Vaccinations could start next week in the United States.The initial report on the British cases touched off alarm and confusion by advising that people who had ever had a "severe allergic reaction" to a food, drug or vaccine should not receive the vaccine. The nature of the reaction was not explained at first, leaving many people with allergies to food or bee stings wondering if the new vaccine would be safe for them.But the regulators\' subsequent clarification specified that their advice applied to people who had ever gone into anaphylaxis. It urged people with a "history of serious allergies" to discuss it with their doctors "prior to getting the jab."Authorities also said the shots should be given only in settings equipped to resuscitate patients if needed, by giving injections of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.What is known so far?The two health care workers in Britain had experienced anaphylaxis in the past because of food allergies, a Pfizer official said during the FDA meeting Thursday. Both carried EpiPen-type devices to inject themselves with epinephrine in case of such a reaction.They needed epinephrine to treat their reactions to the vaccine, and both recovered.British health authorities said they would continue to investigate. It is not known whether an ingredient in the vaccine caused the workers\' reactions.People with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine were excluded from Pfizer\'s studies, company officials said at the meeting Thursday.Among those who participated in the Pfizer trials, a very small number of people had allergic reactions. A document published by the FDA on Tuesday said that 0.63% of participants who received the vaccine reported potential allergic reactions, compared to 0.51% of people who received a placebo.In Pfizer\'s late-stage clinical trial, one of the 18,801 participants who received the vaccine had an anaphylactic reaction, according to safety data published by the FDA on Tuesday. None in the placebo group did.If I have allergies, should I be concerned?Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading expert on infectious diseases, said Wednesday that the allergic reactions were concerning but most likely rare, the kind of effects that show up when a vaccine moves out of testing and into broader distribution."If I were a person that had an underlying allergic tendency, I might want to be prepared that I might get a reaction and therefore be ready to treat it," Fauci said, in a webcast moderated by Dr. Sanjay Gupta of CNN, sponsored by Harvard and The New England Journal of Medicine.Fauci acknowledged that the problem could turn out to affect a lot of people."That\'s one of the reasons why it\'s important to cover the waterfront with different vaccine platforms," he said, adding, "If in fact we do find out that there is a consistent issue of a certain subset of people like those with allergic reactions, you\'ll always have other vaccine platforms that you can use, and hopefully you will not see that with those other platforms."Should people with allergies avoid Pfizer\'s vaccine?Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the initial, broad recommendation in Britain mentioning severe allergic reactions seemed to be an overreaction that could needlessly scare many people away from a desperately needed vaccine in the middle of a raging pandemic.Millions of people in the United States are allergic to foods like eggs or peanuts, as well as medicines or bee stings, and have had reactions that were serious enough to lead doctors to advise them to carry epinephrine injectors. But that does not necessarily mean the vaccine is risky for them, he said. About 5% of children and 4% of adults in the United States have food allergies, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Fewer than 1 in 1 million recipients of other vaccines a year in the United States have an anaphylactic reaction, Offit said.Those reactions are treatable and much easier to control than a severe case of COVID-19, he said.Many people with allergies to foods, bee stings or medicines have received multiple vaccines without problems.As a member of the FDA advisory panel that met Thursday, Offit voted in favor of authorizing the Pfizer vaccine. But during the panel\'s discussion of allergic reactions, he said, "This issue is not going to die until we have better data."He said research should be done to find out whether an ingredient in the vaccine can cause allergic reactions and whether people with other allergies might be especially sensitive to it.Dr. Moncef Slaoui, head of the government\'s Operation Warp Speed program to develop vaccines, said Wednesday that he thought U.S. experts would also advise people who have had severe allergic reactions to avoid the vaccine until the cases in Britain were fully explained.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University, said, "I wish Dr. Slaoui hadn\'t gotten ahead of his skis."He said recommendations about who should or should not get the vaccine would be made by expert advisory panels to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will be meeting Friday and this weekend.Schaffner said it seemed unlikely that the main ingredient in Pfizer\'s vaccine, genetic material called mRNA, would cause an allergic reaction.Next week, the FDA\'s advisory panel will vote on whether to recommend authorizing a second coronavirus vaccine that uses mRNA, made by Moderna. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are similar but not identical: They use different types of fat particles, for instance, to coat the mRNA.Schaffner said he knew of no evidence that people with food allergies were more likely than anyone else to have a severe reaction to a vaccine."We\'ve dealt with allergies to all kinds of medicines and vaccines in medical practice, and we can do that in this circumstance also," Schaffner said. "Everybody needs to be trained to be able to deal with this and deal with it promptly. I think we can manage this."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Last week, nine of the country\'s 10 political parties voted to back a wide-ranging plan that would see the majority of restrictions on normal life removed by the end of May, coinciding with vaccines having been offered to all over-50s. That is in contrast to Britain, which should reach the same vaccines landmark by mid-April but will not fully remove restrictions until late June, when the entire adult population will have been offered a first dose. Starting on April 6 with the reopening of hairdressers, restrictions in Denmark will be eased every two weeks, with larger shopping centres allowed to open from April 21 and indoor dining returning from May 6. Danish officials are aware that the unlocking is likely to lead to an increase in Covid infections and hospitalisations but believe the problem is manageable. Discussing the first stage of lockdown easing in late February, Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, said: "We are taking a calculated risk. The lockdown is starting to have very grave consequences. But the reopening comes with a price – the more you reopen, the more people will be infected and the more people will be hospitalised."', 'num_of_covid': 1}

"The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine (including Covishield) continues to have a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world," the WHO\'s global advisory committee on vaccine safety said in a statement issued after its independent experts met on Tuesday and on Thursday to review data. The statement also said that the reported rates of blood clotting "are in line with the expected number of diagnoses of these conditions" and that the observed rate has been "fewer than expected". The WHO chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also added at a regular press briefing on Friday that there is "no question" over whether people should take the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The organisation\'s backing of AstraZeneca follows Thursday afternoon\'s green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Europe\'s leading states, including Germany and Italy, reversing course on their suspension on administering the jab.

She experienced a rash over her face and torso, shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate.Dr. Lindy Jones, the hospital\'s emergency department medical director, said the worker was first given a shot of epinephrine, a standard treatment for severe allergic reactions. Her symptoms subsided but then reemerged, and she was treated with steroids and an epinephrine drip.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesWhen doctors tried to stop the drip, her symptoms reemerged yet again, so the woman was moved to the intensive care unit, observed throughout the night, then weaned off the drip early Wednesday morning, Jones said. He said the woman felt well, remained enthusiastic about the vaccine and was set to be discharged later Wednesday.Although the Pfizer vaccine was shown to be safe and about 95% effective in a clinical trial involving 44,000 participants, the Alaska case will likely intensify concerns about possible side effects. Experts described the woman\'s symptoms as potentially life-threatening and said that they may prompt calls for tighter guidelines to ensure that recipients are carefully monitored for adverse reactions.Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert and member of an outside advisory panel that recommended the Food and Drug Administration authorize the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use, said the appropriate precautions are already in place. For instance, he said, the requirement that recipients remain in place for 15 minutes after getting the vaccine helped ensure the woman was quickly treated."I don\'t think this means we should pause" vaccine distribution, he said. "Not at all." But he said researchers need to figure out "what component of the vaccine is causing this reaction."Dr. Jay Butler, a top infectious disease expert with the Centers for Disease Control, said the Alaska case showed the monitoring system works. The agency has recommended that the vaccine be administered in settings that have supplies, including oxygen and epinephrine, to manage anaphylactic reactions.Millions of Americans are in line to be inoculated with the Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year. As of Wednesday night, it was unclear how many Americans have received it. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, said that his department will be releasing that data "several days or maybe a week into this."The Alaska woman\'s reaction was believed to be similar to the anaphylactic reactions two health workers in Britain experienced after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last week. Like her, both recovered.Those cases are expected to come up Thursday, when FDA scientists are scheduled to meet with the agency\'s outside panel of experts to decide whether to recommend that regulators approve Moderna\'s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.Although Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are both based on the same type of technology and are similar in their ingredients, it is not clear whether an allergic reaction to one would occur with the other. Both consist of genetic material called mRNA encased in a bubble of oily molecules called lipids, although they use different combinations of lipids.Offit said in both vaccines, the bubbles are coated with a stabilizing molecule called polyethylene glycol that he considers a "leading contender" for triggering an allergic reaction. He stressed that more investigation is needed.Pfizer\'s trial did not find any serious adverse events caused by the vaccine, although many participants did experience aches, fevers and other side effects. The Alaska woman\'s reaction was assumed to be related to the vaccine because it occurred so quickly after the shot.A Pfizer spokesperson, Jerica Pitts, said that the company does not yet have all the details of the case but is working with local health authorities. The vaccine comes with information warning that medical treatment should be available in case of a rare anaphylactic event, she said. "We will closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed," Pitts said.After the workers in Britain fell ill, authorities there initially warned against giving the vaccines to anyone with a history of severe allergic reactions. They later clarified their concerns, changing the wording from "severe allergic reactions" to specify that the vaccine should not be given to anyone who has ever had an anaphylactic reaction to a food, medicine or vaccine. That type of reaction to a vaccine is "very rare," they said.Pfizer officials have said the two British people who had the reaction had a history of severe allergies. One, a 49-year-old woman, had a history of egg allergies. The other, a 40-year-old woman, had a history of allergies to several different medications. Both carried EpiPen-like devices to inject themselves with epinephrine in case of such a reaction.Pfizer has said that its vaccine does not contain egg ingredients.The British update also said that a third patient had a "possible allergic reaction" but did not describe it.In the United States, federal regulators issued a broad authorization for the vaccine Friday to adults 16 years and older. Health care providers were warned not to give the vaccine to anyone with a "known history of a severe allergic reaction" to any component of the vaccine, which they said was a standard warning for vaccines.But because of the British cases, FDA officials have said they would require Pfizer to increase its monitoring for anaphylaxis and submit data on it once the vaccine comes into use. Pfizer also said that the vaccine is recommended to be administered in settings that have access to equipment to manage anaphylaxis. Last weekend, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that people with serious allergies can be safely vaccinated with close monitoring for 30 minutes after receiving the shot.Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, with impaired breathing and drops in blood pressure that usually occur within minutes or even seconds after exposure to a food, medicine or even a substance like latex to which the person is allergic.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

That\'s more than twice the number of fatalities in India, the country reporting the second-highest number of cases in the world. And as the U.S. crosses that milestone - losing on average 800 people a day to virus - the pandemic here is not localised in one or two epicenters: it\'s smouldering across the nation. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb painted a grim picture. "The Northeast still is holding on to the gains that it achieved in driving down infections. But we\'re seeing infections starting to rise in the South as well. And you\'re definitely seeing a concentration of new infections in the Midwest. So that\'s- that\'s driving a lot of the growth and infections. But it\'s getting more distributed around the country." That\'s fueling fears that as cooler weather drives Americans indoors and flu season hits, new outbreaks could surpass the surge seen over the summer. Although new cases are down about 50% from the peak in July, the United States is still reporting on average nearly 40,000 new infections a day - the highest number in the developed world. "The United States has done really well." U.S. President Donald Trump continues to paint an optimistic picture of pandemic. "And I really do believe we\'re rounding the corner. And the vaccines are right there." His own heath officials, including the U.S. top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, disagree. "We need to be doing much better than we\'re doing that\'s for sure." The president is seeking re-election amid the health crisis. He\'s repeatedly claimed a vaccine could be available within weeks. The director of the Centers for Disease Control bluntly disagreed, saying he didn\'t see one widely available until the middle of next year. "I think we\'re probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter, 2021."

Republicans say the Biden plan is too big, too costly and comes too soon on the heels of the package passed in December. "We just passed $900 billion worth of assistance. Why we would have a package that big now? Maybe a couple of months from now," Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said. "The needs will be evident, and we will need to do something significant. But I\'m not seeing it right now." GOP senators made clear this week that Biden’s plan would not be able to get the Republican votes that would be needed for passage. “I don’t think it can get 60 [votes]. Because even the people on our side that would be inclined to want to work with the administration on something like that, that price range is going to be out of range for them,” said Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD), according to Politico. “Absent some change and economic conditions, etc., I think that would be a very heavy lift.” Seeking agreement – or not: Brian Deese, director of Biden’s National Economic Council, is planning to meet with a bipartisan group of 16 senators on Sunday to try to make the case that the economy needs support on the scale of Biden’s proposal, and that the risk of doing too little far outweighs the risk of doing too much. “We’re at a precarious moment for the virus and the economy,” Deese told reporters at a White House press briefing Friday. "What I can tell you is, if we don’t act now, we will be in a much worse place and we will find ourselves needing to do much more to dig out of a much deeper hole.” The administration’s push for another large relief package comes as emergency unemployment benefits provided under the $900 billion Covid package passed last month are set to expire on March 14. Democrats, meanwhile, are also looking at bypassing the threat of a Republican filibuster, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly telling donors Thursday night that she wanted to pass Biden’s plan in two weeks via a process known as reconciliation, which would require a simple majority rather than 60 votes in the Senate. Some House Democrats have considered passing a smaller, bipartisan package focused on vaccine funding and direct payments to Americans, but party leaders reportedly have yet to finalize their strategy. The White House is reportedly pressing Democrats to be patient as Biden works to figure out the contours of a possible compromise deal. “Biden has spent the last several days on the phone with lawmakers in both parties, and his team has started a blitz in recent days not only to walk through the proposal with lawmakers and staff, but also listen to their concerns and potential proposed changes,” CNN reports. Debt concerns resurface: A number of Republicans have based their objections to Biden’s plan in renewed concerns about the nation’s large deficits and the rapidly rising debt. The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell argues in a Friday column that those rediscovered GOP concerns are both hypocritical and misguided: “As soon as a Democrat enters the White House, Republicans pretend to care about deficits again,” she writes. “These foul-weather fiscal hawks neglect to mention, of course, that the GOP’s prized 2017 tax cuts added nearly $2 trillion to deficits — back when the economy was doing okay. Nor did they note that — again, before the coronavirus pandemic — the Republican-controlled Senate passed and President Donald Trump signed spending bills that added another $2 trillion to deficits.” Rampell notes that, while the country does face long-term structural budget challenges, economists including incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, among many others, have urged Congress to provide more aid and set aside debt fears for the time being. Yellen, as we told you earlier this week, told the Senate Finance Committee that higher deficit spending is actually the fiscally responsible thing to do right now. “To avoid doing what we need to do now to address the pandemic and the economic damage that it’s causing would likely leave us in a worse place fiscally and with respect to our debt situation,” Yellen said. Biden has echoed that argument, saying again Friday that the benefits of his plan will far exceed the costs and that our debt situation would ultimately be less stable if we don’t provide additional economic relief now. Republican objections to Biden’s plan go beyond the cost to the specific policies. “It’s reckless to borrow another $2 trillion on top of $4 trillion already in the pipeline,” Sen. Chuck Grassley writes in a Friday op-ed for Fox News. “While more pandemic relief is needed, some of the line items are a political pipe dream for progressives.” Grassley again calls the Biden plan a “liberal laundry list” and warns that Biden’s proposed $15 federal minimum wage would “wipe out” small businesses that are already hurting. The bottom line: This weekend’s meeting between Deese and centrist senators will be just one step in the Biden administration’s efforts to navigate a path toward a bipartisan compromise after its $1.9 trillion opening bid. Congressional Democrats are preparing a more partisan approach as a fallback option, but for now Biden reportedly prefers trying to drum up Republican support and believes he can find a way to secure 10 votes from the Senate GOP. Either way, this process is likely going to take a while. Like what you\'re reading? Sign up for our free newsletter.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Dubai launched its Covid-19 vaccination programme Wednesday with a senior citizen and a nurse among the first to be inoculated using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the government said. The UAE - which is made up of seven emirates including the capital Abu Dhabi and Dubai - approved the emergency registration of the vaccine on Tuesday, the same day the first batch arrived from abroad, the official WAM news agency reported. Dubai "begins Covid-19 vaccination \'Pfizer-BioNTech\' campaign", the Dubai Media Office tweeted, along with pictures of men and women receiving the jab. It added that the first phase of the rollout will target citizens and residents over the age of 60, adults with chronic diseases, people with special needs as well as frontline and other key workers. Along with the elderly man and nurse, a paramedic, a police officer and a driver were among the first to receive the jab in Dubai, which has said vaccination will be "free of charge" for all citizens and residents. The first batch arrived on an Emirates cargo flight from Brussels on Tuesday, WAM said. "It has been our honour to transport these vaccines free of charge on our flight," the airline\'s chairman and chief executive, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, said in a statement. The Dubai Media Office said that vaccinations will be available at six health authority facilities. Earlier this month, the United Arab Emirates had already approved the vaccine developed by Chinese drugs giant Sinopharm, which it said was 86 percent effective. The vaccine produced by US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech - which proved to be 95 percent effective in late-stage clinical trials - is administered in two doses, 21 days apart. The vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), a temperature much lower than standard freezers and which forced the company to develop special containers for transport. Taking part in the vaccination campaign remains voluntary in the UAE, but officials have encouraged the population to be inoculated. Two vaccines have undergone third-phase trials in the UAE - the Sinopharm project and Russia\'s Sputnik-V, named after the Soviet-era satellite. Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum said in November that he had received an experimental coronavirus vaccine, joining other top UAE officials to take part in the trials. The UAE has so far recorded more than 197,000 cases of the novel coronavirus, including 645 deaths.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The 'working theory', according to Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton, is that the virus may have spread further than expected because someone with COVID in the hotel had to use a nebuliser for medical reasons. It's one of a couple of times in the past week or so that someone's caught the virus in a quarantine hotel, apparently without any close contact with an active case. So on today's Coronacast, what does this mean for our understanding of how the coronavirus spreads through the air? Also on today's show: * Do quarantine hotels have an airflow problem? * How did a NSW returning traveller test negative twice, then positive after their 14-day quarantine? * What did the WHO fact-finding team discover about the origins of the virus on their trip to China? Is there any chance it escaped from a lab? * Do vaccines for other diseases only prevent severe illness and not infection, like we keep hearing about coronavirus vaccines?

{'_id': 'f7d8c9d38f64fc325f135c20992d5724', 'title': "Dr. Fauci Just Said He's Doing This for the First Time in a Year", 'description': 'The past year has been challenging for all of us, including White House COVID adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, who—after more than 50 years in the medical field—has become one of the most familiar faces in the country. Since lockdowns began in March 2020, people have been avoiding many of the things that make life worthwhile, including family gatherings, hugs, and dinners with friends. But now that Fauci is fully vaccinated, he said he\'s able to do something he hasn\'t done in a year. To see what Fauci, and any vaccinated person, can finally do after the jab, read on, and for more things you can do post-vaccination, Dr. Fauci Just Confirmed You Can Do This After Getting Vaccinated. Dr. Fauci is finally going to hug his daughter again. Fauci told CNN\'s Chris Cuomo on Feb. 25 that he can finally embrace his daughter again now that they\'re both fully vaccinated. "My professional judgment is that when my daughter wants to come in here, and she is doubly vaccinated, I’m going to have her over to the house, and I’m going to give her a big hug that I haven’t been able to do for a year," Fauci said. He encouraged others to get the shot when they\'re eligible so they can reap the same benefits themselves. And for more guidance from the infectious disease expert, Dr. Fauci Just Said Don\'t Take This Medication With the COVID Vaccine. Experts say it\'s safe for fully vaccinated people to gather. According to Fauci, two fully vaccinated people can gather with minimal risk involved. "What we\'re saying right now, even though it isn\'t backed by data—it\'s backed by common sense that if you have two vaccinated people and they want to get together, be they family members or friends that you know are vaccinated, you can start" seeing each other, he said.Fauci explained that while the risk is not zero, it "becomes extremely low when you have both parties vaccinated." And for more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter. Fauci believes increased freedom to do things safely will encourage people to get the vaccine. Cuomo pointed out that people are beginning to "get transactional" about the vaccine, wondering what\'s in it for them. But aside from protection from COVID, the vaccine will also provide people with more freedom, which Fauci thinks will help nudge them to get the shot."We\'re going to start seeing people saying, \'The more people get vaccinated, I could have dinner with my family member that comes in. I can go see my mother if she\'s vaccinated and I\'m vaccinated,\'" Fauci said. And for side effects to prepare for, Dr. Fauci Said He Had Pain in These 2 Places After the COVID Vaccine. We will continue to learn more benefits of vaccination. Fauci noted that when COVID vaccinations first began, there was limited data, so vaccinated people were encouraged to continue taking all the same precautions as those who were unvaccinated. This made some people feel like there weren\'t enough concrete benefits to getting the vaccine, he said.But Fauci believes that we\'re going to see a gradual increase in the things you\'ll be able to do "normal" again. "There will be a benefit both socially and personally and from a public health standpoint," he said. And for more essential vaccine advice, The CDC Says Don\'t Do This With the Second Dose of Your COVID Vaccine.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Andrew Cuomo ordered state-run hospitals to stop suing patients over unpaid medical bills, and almost all of the major private hospitals in the state voluntarily followed suit by suspending their claims.But one chain of hospitals has plowed ahead with thousands of lawsuits: Northwell Health, which is the state\'s largest health system and is run by one of Cuomo\'s closest allies.The nonprofit Northwell sued more than 2,500 patients last year, records show, a flood of litigation even as the pandemic has led to widespread job losses and economic uncertainty.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe Northwell lawsuits each sought an average of $1,700 in unpaid bills, plus large interest payments. They hit teachers, construction workers, grocery store employees and others, including some who had lost work in the pandemic or gotten sick themselves."My salary was cut in half. I\'m now working only two days a week. And now I have to deal with this," said Carlos Castillo, a hotel worker in New York City who was sued for $4,043 after being hospitalized with a seizure at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, which is part of the Northwell system.Castillo, 37, said he was worried that the hospital would seize his paychecks and leave him unable to pay rent.Across the country, medical debt lawsuits have grown increasingly common in recent years, as health care costs have risen and insurance companies have shifted more of the burden onto patients through larger deductibles and copayments. The cases are rarely contested in court and usually lead to default judgments, allowing hospitals to garnish wages and freeze accounts to extract money, sometimes without the patient\'s knowledge.Northwell has not been alone in pursuing debt through the courts during the pandemic. About 50 hospitals in New York have sued a total of 5,000 patients since March, according to a search of filings in courts around the state. Most are small and located upstate.Northwell stands out because of the sheer number of its lawsuits -- and because of its connections to Cuomo. The other major New York City hospital systems, including NewYork-Presbyterian and NYU Langone Health, have largely suspended lawsuits during the pandemic. It is unclear when they might begin suing again.The Northwell system operates 23 hospitals, including Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital and North Shore University Hospital. It brings in about $12.5 billion in annual revenue and received $1.2 billion in emergency funding through the stimulus package in the federal CARES Act last year.It has sued over unpaid bills as small as $700, records show.Northwell\'s chief executive officer, Michael Dowling, was the state health director and deputy secretary to former Gov. Mario Cuomo, the current governor\'s late father, and he has been a close friend to the younger Cuomo for more than three decades.During the pandemic, Dowling has served as the governor\'s closest ally in the hospital industry and his liaison to all of the state\'s hospitals. He has set up meetings and delivered messages for Cuomo, led a council to increase bed capacity at hospitals, overseen patient transfers to field hospitals and worked with the state on studies of antibody test results that have been used to identify hot spots for the virus.Dowling has also appeared frequently with Cuomo at the governor\'s news briefings; both men wrote books this year, and Cuomo wrote a blurb promoting Dowling\'s writing.Northwell received the first doses of the coronavirus vaccine in the state last month.Barbara Osborn, a Northwell spokeswoman, declined to say whether Dowling had discussed the lawsuits with Cuomo. A spokesman for the governor did not respond to requests for comment.Richard Miller, the system\'s chief business strategy officer, defended the cases, saying that Northwell had the right to collect what it was owed. He said that Northwell has a financial-assistance program for low-income patients that is more generous than required by the government, and he said the system sues only employed patients that it believes have the ability to pay and who do not respond to outreach attempts."We have no interest in pursing these cases legally. It\'s not what we want to do," Miller said in an interview. "Unfortunately, in some cases, they\'re not leaving us much of an option."Miller added that even with the stimulus money, Northwell lost $300 million last year.He also said that all of the suits that Northwell had filed in 2020 stemmed from hospitalizations that occurred months or years before the pandemic began.The other health systems that filed the most lawsuits last year echoed that sentiment, emphasizing that they have not sued any coronavirus patients.St. Peter\'s Health Partners, which runs a chain of hospitals in the Albany area and filed about 1,000 lawsuits last year, and Oneida Health, a health care system near Syracuse that filed about 500 lawsuits, both said in statements that they temporarily stopped suing in the spring but resumed over the summer.Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society, a nonprofit that advocates anti-poverty policies, criticized hospitals for suing patients during the pandemic, even over unpaid bills from hospitalizations in past years.She said that a few hundred dollars may not mean much to a hospital chain but can be a significant burden for a low-income patient."It means someone is going hungry," Benjamin said. "It means a kid is not getting a winter coat."In some cases, the lawsuits have sought even larger sums. John T. Mather Memorial Hospital on Long Island, which is owned by Northwell, sued Thomas Kasper in April for $31,340 in unpaid bills -- plus about $8,000 in interest and fees, records show.That hospital also sued Scott Buckley for $21,028, plus about $4,000 in interest and fees."I am literally broke," said Buckley, 48, who works at a Stop & Shop grocery store. "I don\'t have a penny to my name. I have three kids. If they take my paycheck, I won\'t have anything."One of Buckley\'s daughters, Kacey Buckley, 22, who works for a cat breeder, is also being sued over unpaid medical bills in an unrelated case, records show. Northwell recently began garnishing 10% of her paycheck.The Community Service Society published a report on medical debt lawsuits earlier last year. Benjamin said the group\'s latest numbers showed that New York\'s nonprofit hospitals had filed more than 40,000 lawsuits against patients between 2015 and 2019.The group found that Northwell sued patients far more often than any other hospital chain -- about 14,000 in that period, or about 2,800 a year. That was about one-third of the suits identified by the advocacy group; Northwell operates only about one-tenth of the hospitals in the state.Northwell filed fewer cases last year, but not by much.State lawmakers introduced legislation last year that would increase transparency in medical billing, limit the time period in which hospitals can sue and cap the interest that hospitals can collect.The bill\'s sponsors, Assembly member Richard Gottfried and Sen. Gustavo Rivera, both Democrats who chair their chambers\' health committees, said the lawsuits filed during the pandemic were evidence of the importance of the proposal.Still, they said, it will be difficult to pass the bill in Albany, where the hospital industry has a lot of clout."It\'s going to be difficult, there\'s no doubt," Rivera said. "The hospitals are powerful."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Netanyahu and his allies are projected to win 52 or 53 seats, while the ideologically diverse group of parties opposed to Netanyahu look set to have 60 seats. The remaining votes will go to Yamina, the party led by former Netanyahu ally Naftali Bennett, who has positioned himself as the key swing vote. This was Israel\'s fourth national election in two years, and the split decision Tuesday could mean a fifth election. Netanyahu, Israel\'s longest-serving leader, has led the last four series of unstable governments. He campaigned this time on Israel\'s successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign and a series of agreements with Arab countries. Netanyahu\'s opponents argue he shouldn\'t be allowed to lead Israel while standing trial on criminal corruption charges. It the exit polls are correct, Netanyahu would not have a majority even if Bennett\'s Yamina party joins his right-wing coalition. But it will also be hard for his main opponent, Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid party, to find common ground to form a government with the other anti-Netanyahu parties. Still, Axios says, "those parties could potentially pass a law, targeting Netanyahu, to ban anyone under a criminal indictment to serve as prime minister." "I have already begun this evening to hold talks with some of the leaders of the bloc for change and will continue in the next few days," Lapid said. A subdued Netanyahu addressed supporters early Wednesdays, touting his Likud party\'s "great achievement" but not declaring victory. "We must not under any circumstances drag the state of Israel to new elections, to a fifth election," he said. "We must form a stable government now."

{'_id': 'ad7d5f4d4a52edb28bf1e5fbe3012739', 'title': "Biden Wants Harris to Have a Major Role. What It Is Hasn't Been Defined.", 'description': 'WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden was rattling off a list of his priorities for a coronavirus relief bill in one of his first meetings with reporters as commander in chief when he stopped midsentence to correct himself. Those items, Biden said, are what “we think the priorities are,” putting the emphasis on the pronoun. Then, turning to face Vice President Kamala Harris, standing a few socially distanced feet behind him, he apologized. It was a rare slip for the president, who has worked to include Harris in nearly all his public appearances, and stress that she is a full partner in the decisions he makes. Those recurring scenes are the most tangible result of Biden’s efforts — and a presidential directive — to treat Harris, the first woman and Black vice president, as an equal stakeholder as he works to knit together the nation’s political rifts, address racial inequalities and bring the coronavirus pandemic to heel. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “The president has given us clear instructions,” Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, said in an interview. “Our goal is to get her out there as much as we can.” Harris’ relationship with the president was forged by the bare-knuckle politics of the Democratic primary campaign, when she emerged as one of Biden’s most vocal opponents. A surprising chemistry with Biden made them running mates and now that relationship will be crucial in enabling Harris to define herself in what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. said has proved “to be a job of spectacular and, I believe, incurable frustration.” “She went from this failed campaign to getting the golden ticket, as the chief surrogate for a guy who appreciates the role of vice president, and is going to put her out there in this historic role,” said Gil Duran, a former aide to Harris when she served as California attorney general. “So the question is: What does she do with this reset?” The answer is a work in progress. The vice president has already made her presence known, most recently Friday morning, when she traveled to Capitol Hill before sunrise to cast a tiebreaking vote in the Senate, clearing the way for Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package to move forward without Republican support. And as the barrier-breaking part of the partnership, Harris has assumed the burden of living up to the expectations of voters, especially people of color, who helped put Biden in the Oval Office. It is a burden Klain says she has borne “with grace” even as it weighs heavily on her. Others say it will take time for her to chart her own course. For now, the vice president’s staff advisers seem determined to cement and highlight her bond with Biden through their joint appearances, even as they seek to avoid letting Harris become a rigid, mannequinlike figure standing by the president’s side, much as Vice President Mike Pence did throughout the past four years. For a model, Harris needs to look no further than Biden. In eight years as vice president, he carved out his own role beside President Barack Obama, but not before overcoming a relationship that was, at first, stiff and formal. Biden and Harris are off to a faster start. They have spent far more time together than their predecessors — usually four to five hours a day in the White House, aides say — in part because the coronavirus pandemic has limited their travel. Harris and Biden usually begin the day receiving the President’s Daily Brief together in the Oval Office, a tradition reinstated since the departure of President Donald Trump, who had little interest in it. They also quickly embraced the idea of a weekly lunch in the White House as a private opportunity to build trust and share thoughts. In building her own staff, Harris selected people who she knew had good relationships with the president and his team. She chose Tina Flournoy, who has close ties to Klain, to run her office. Ashley Etienne, a former adviser to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is her communications director. Harris also knew that the president held Symone Sanders, who worked as press secretary to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign before joining the Biden campaign, in high regard. Symone Sanders is now her press secretary. Aides to the vice president repeatedly stressed that all of her public events and messages were closely coordinated with members of Biden’s team. A visit by Harris last week to the National Institutes of Health to thank scientists and receive her second dose of the coronavirus vaccine was paired with a speech later in the day by Biden in which he announced the acquisition of 200 million additional doses of the vaccine. That appearance made a lasting impression in the district of Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. In an interview, Beatty said that her phone lit up with calls from constituents who were newly curious about getting the vaccine themselves after photos of Harris receiving the shot hit the internet. Black Americans are nearly three times more likely to die from the coronavirus than white Americans, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but white Americans are more likely to receive the vaccine, in part because of systemic racism present in health care institutions. The sight of a Black woman receiving the vaccine, Beatty said, “gave people hope and gave people education.” Those moments, in which Harris connects with people around the country, are critical to any future she might have beyond the administration. But they are also in line with the messages that Biden hopes his vice president — as a woman, a minority and a generation younger — can deliver on behalf of his agenda. But, as Biden well knows, the more opportunities there are to carve out a separate identity as vice president, the more chances there are to make a mess. As vice president, Biden’s loquaciousness frequently caught the tightly scripted Obama White House off guard. At times, including in 2012 when he voiced support for gay marriage before Obama did, Biden would toss the script completely. When Harris sat for an interview last week with a West Virginia television station, her support for the president’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan was interpreted as an attempt to put pressure on the state’s Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, who took offense and expressed annoyance that he had not been given a heads-up. And in a minor flub during the same interview Harris promoted the clearing of “abandoned land mines” in West Virginia — not “abandoned mine lands” — as a job creation effort in the state. White House officials were quickly in touch with Manchin to do damage control, wallpapering over the flap by publicly praising Manchin’s value to the Biden-Harris agenda. Harris has also faced questions about members of her family profiting from their relationships with her. Reports that Harris’ stepdaughter received a modeling contract a week after Inauguration Day raised eyebrows even among the president’s allies. And a business run by Harris’ niece that sells Harris-themed merchandise has been an ethical issue for Biden’s aides since the campaign. The White House has said that her name will not be used for commercial activities that would “imply an endorsement or support,” according to a spokeswoman. That has not diminished the president’s view of Harris. White House officials said Biden was eager to put her to work, much the way Obama put him in charge of the economic recovery program in early 2009. But the fact that the president does not intend to assign her a specific portfolio immediately inevitably elicited some questions about her role in the administration. Biden has instead handed Harris a flurry of high-profile tasks in their first two weeks in office. Just hours after the president announced on Inauguration Day that the United States planned to rejoin the World Health Organization, the vice president was on the phone with Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the group, reaffirming the new administration’s support after Trump’s sustained attacks on the premier global health institution. The call sent an early message that she speaks for Biden on some of his most critical priorities, but Harris has not been shy about pressing Biden on her own. In the past weeks, aides to the president and vice president said she had repeatedly pushed for more focus on how the administration’s policies would affect less advantaged people in urban and rural communities that are often overlooked. During an Oval Office meeting with Biden and his advisers on their first Monday in the White House, Harris pressed Jeffrey D. Zients, the coronavirus response coordinator, to provide more detail about the use of mobile vaccination centers to ensure that poor people living in remote areas would be able to be protected against the virus. “The vice president pushed us hard, in a very good way, on are there enough mobile units available? As we wrapped up that meeting, she pushed me on, ‘Where we are on mobile vaccination units? How many are we going to have, in what period of time? Are they going to be able to reach rural communities and urban communities? How much progress have you made?’” Zients said. That kind of persistence has left a deep impression on Biden, his aides say. It was just hours after Harris peppered Zients with questions that the president caught himself taking sole credit for his coronavirus relief plan on the stage with Harris. Klain, who has served two vice presidents as chief of staff, said the instance was more evidence that Biden had an instinctual understanding of how those moments might feel. “She starts with a president who has been there and understands what it feels like to be the person standing behind two steps back at a public event,” Klain said. “I think he has this empathy for her situation that is unique.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 3}

So when first doses began being doled out, the Trump administration held back matching second doses to make sure recipients would be fully protected against COVID-19. Amid a massive demand for more doses, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced earlier this week that the department would begin doling out those reserved doses to more people, saying increased production speed would make up for the soon-to-be-depleted reserve.But as officials soon learned, the federal government had stopped stockpiling second dose vaccines weeks ago, they tell the Post. Both first and second doses were instead taken right off the manufacturing line. That meant Azar\'s announcement reportedly released a stockpile that didn\'t exist. The U.S. had already reached its maximum distribution capacity, and new doses distributors were expecting next week weren\'t coming, the Post reports.HHS spokesperson Michael Pratt confirmed in an email to the Post that the last of the reserve had been taken out for shipment this weekend. He didn\'t acknowledge Azar\'s comments, but said Operation Warp Speed had "always intended to transition from holding second doses in reserve as manufacturing stabilizes and we gained confidence in the ability for a consistent flow of vaccines." he also said states had only ordered 75 percent of the vaccines available to them.

Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and one of the leading members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, confirms that the U.S. has the potential to see significantly diminished coronavirus transmission rates in the near future, but there\'s one catch: Enough people must be willing to get the COVID vaccine, Fauci says. Read on to find out how many, and for more vaccine information, check out This Is What Getting a COVID Vaccine Feels Like, According to Volunteers.In a new interview with New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin as part of the paper\'s DealBook Online Summit, Fauci explained that Moderna and Pfizer\'s\xa0vaccines have had "striking results" in clinical trials—with 94.5 percent and 90 percent efficacy rates respectively—but the reliability of the vaccine is only one part of the puzzle. "Very closely connected with that is how many people really take the vaccine," said Fauci. "So, we have a challenge ahead."The infectious disease expert said that it\'s important "to make sure the overwhelming majority of the people in the country get vaccinated," and that even a 50 percent vaccination rate would leave the U.S. with a "considerable public health challenge" on our hands. "At least 80 to 85 percent" of people would need to be vaccinated to meaningfully reduce infection rates, Fauci explained.While distributing a coronavirus vaccine to an adequate number of people is an essential step in stopping the spread of coronavirus, it\'s just that: one step. Read on to find out what else Fauci had to say about getting the pandemic under control. And for risks you shouldn\'t be taking, check out\xa0The 6 Worst Places You\'re Going Right Now, New Study Says.Read the original article on\xa0Best Life. 1 Fauci said things could be back to normal by next fall.While it may feel as though COVID will be here forever, Fauci told Sorkin that "there is a light at the end of the tunnel" in terms of the pandemic. If an adequate number of people get vaccinated, "as we get into the fall [of 2021], we could be quite close to some degree of normality, certainly from the standpoint of the economy, of getting businesses open, of getting sports events being attended," said Fauci.However, without enough people getting vaccinated, masks and social distancing will have to remain part of everyone\'s routines. "You\'re not going to have a vaccine completely replace public health measures… the degree of stringency of it is going to depend on the level of infection in the community," Fauci explained. And if you want to protect yourself, read up on The Surprising Supplement That Can Cut Your COVID Risk, New Study Says. 2 And he said home tests could be rolled out in the future.Though testing symptomatic people remains a critical element in reducing infection rates, Fauci explained that testing asymptomatic people—and rolling out home tests to do so—is also very important."What we really need now is… testing that people can essentially do at home, like a pregnancy test, because the spread is community spread of people without symptoms," Fauci explained. The doctor said that the only way to "get to the bottom of the community spread" from people who don\'t realize they\'re infected is through continued testing of asymptomatic individuals. And if you\'re worried about a COVID surge near you, These Are All the States Locking Down Again. 3 Therapeutics will be a big part of treating COVID in the future, Fauci explained.While Fauci admitted that existing therapeutic treatments for severe COVID patients, like dexamethasone, have "dramatically" decreased death rates, he said it\'s important for the medical community to create therapeutics for people with less severe cases of the virus, too. "What we do need are medications that are orally administered that you can give to someone who has symptoms to keep them from requiring hospitalization," Fauci explained. And for the latest COVID news delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter. 4 And he also urged caution surrounding holiday celebrations.With the holidays fast approaching, Fauci recommended that families "make a risk-benefit assessment" before deciding to get together. "You have to ask yourself: for this particular holiday season, do you really want to take the risk of endangering the health of a loved one?" he asked.He admitted that his own family would not spend the holiday together because of those very concerns. "My daughters—who are adult, professional women in different parts of the country—have made a decision, as difficult as it is… that they want to protect their daddy."So, how will he be spending the holiday? "I\'m going to sit down with my lovely wife, have a meal, and watch them on Zoom."

New York City Does Not Want You Back.', 'description': 'Deposed presidential spawn Ivanka Trump and hubby Jared Kushner would fit in great in New York City—in Staten Island, that is. But Manhattan—where Ivanka was photographed last Friday, enjoying a brief return to the Kushners’ Park Avenue digs—happened to vote overwhelmingly for Biden/Harris. There was no discernible fraud, as a whopping 84 percent of Manhattan voters emphatically endorsed the team that wasn’t Trump/Pence. What’s more, in Manhattan—where a gigantic Black Lives Matter slogan is laid out in front of Trump Tower, à la “Surrender, Dorothy”—we’re extremely vocal about what we like and don’t like. And we detest whispery-voiced princess Ivanka and slumlord Jared, who many have dubbed the two least qualified people to ever populate the White House. (I sincerely doubt that their ascent was a result of the “skill-based hiring” Ivanka’s always touting.) Ivanka Trump Is Never, Ever Going to Be ForgivenIn New York, we care about queers, women, immigrants, diversity, housing, the workplace, COVID, and the media. Considering their record on those things, these two would be about as welcome in Manhattan as Rudy Giuliani at an open-mic night.Besides, why on earth would Ivanka and Jared want to move back to the place that daddy calls “a ghost town” and is always trying to spite, most recently saying he’d withhold a COVID vaccine from New York State in April because of Governor Andrew Cuomo’s resistance to an unproven remedy (though Trump won’t even be in power when that becomes an issue, making this just random antagonism, as usual)? I guess because deep down, they know that NYC isn’t really over—that it’ll always “be best” and that the alleged lawless ghost town is actually the site of swarms of people shopping, eating outdoors, and wearing masks in a way that’s brought COVID deaths from over 1,000 a day to about 28. (You know how we would really have become a ghost town? If we had adopted Donald Trump’s nonchalant approach to the pandemic rather than heed Cuomo’s urgency.)Alas for the Kushners, it also means that throngs not only rallied to vote daddy out of office, they clanged pots and cheered in the streets when it was clear that Biden/Harris won and “the Infector General” was on the way out, ending our communal nightmare. This is no longer their town at all, even if they pull an Ebenezer Scrooge and suddenly start randomly handing out turkeys. Of course, staying in D.C. wouldn’t be such a great option for them either; a pitiful 5.5. percent of the voters there backed Trump, no doubt because they’ve had to observe him up close for four years. But I’m begging the Kushners to not move back to New York, if just to spare us years of New York Times articles about their attempted social exploits here.We remember every cringe-making moment and have screenshotted every tweet. For example, we vividly remember when Ivanka promised that she had the LGBTQ community’s back. Yeah, with a cleaver; she smilingly posed with bigotry-blessed evangelicals and didn’t update us with any complaints as pops took away queer protections that had been implemented by Obama/Biden, one by one. Jared himself reportedly said that “That’s their problem” when New York City begged for COVID supplies back when the pandemic was ravaging the city hardest.We also recall with a grimace when Ivanka claimed that workers didn’t want guaranteed jobs or higher minimum wage—they supposedly don’t want to be “given” anything—later adding that in the midst of the Depression caused by the pandemic, people should maybe just rethink things and “Find Something New.” Unemployed Americans were practically selling their body parts on eBay in order to pay the rent, but Ivanka’s advice was, basically, to just become a concert violinist or a court stenographer! And now, poetically enough, she will have to take her own advice and dramatically change directions.Will she restart her fashion shtick, pursue art collecting, up her participation in the Trump Organization, or prepare her 2024 run, thereby competing with her dad and brother Donny Jr. for the nomination? Whatever the case, she would be more likely to be thrown a muzzle than a parade if she settled back on Park Avenue. Yes, there will always be some starry-eyed ninnies who’d be excited to have anyone famous in their midst, but for the most part there would be so much hooting and jeering that the sale of bullhorns would surely go up even faster than “46” hats. This is the town, after all, which richly appreciated the Lincoln Project’s Times Square billboards of Jared and Ivanka perversely smiling about all the COVID casualties—an image they furiously threatened to sue over. Apparently, defending their honor is what it took for these two to take decisive action regarding COVID, lol.My gut feeling is that the Trump clan longs to be embraced by the “cultural elite” they claim to scorn, but that’s not ever going to happen. While Ivanka might fancy herself on the cover of Vogue, I bet Hillary-adoring editor Anna Wintour won’t even invite her to buy a table for the Met Gala when that event starts up again. Living in New York, but avoiding—or being shunned by—so many swell soirees could make you feel like Glenn Close at the Oscars. As a controversial social columnist, I’ve had periods of feeling that way myself!At least daddy is sure to avoid New York, except for the barrage of court cases that he’ll be strongly invited to attend. According to his ex-partner in crime Michael Cohen, Trump will probably head to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and never come back. (Or maybe he can nab a Cabinet position—in Russia—or become French roommates with Roman Polanski.) As for Melania, she will no doubt file for divorce on Jan. 20, but I echo over 78 million people when I say, “I really don’t care, do u?” The vast majority of Manhattanites don’t want to see these creatures again any more than we crave a return to “Stop and frisk.” Don’t forget that New York City knows Trump even better than D.C. does. We had to deal with him for decades, all through the Central Park Five years, and the cheating era, and the misogyny moments, and the money mishandling. We have always seen through him, so he loathes us and perennially wants to get us back, in Pee-wee Herman fashion (“I know you are, but what am I?”). Carl Bernstein says that about half the Republican senators privately find Trump distasteful, but I guess they cower in fear of a bad tweet, so they’ve enabled every hideous thing he’s said and done. But now they won’t have to do that anymore—ding dong, the witch, etc. After the Senate runoffs, they should be freer to crawl out of yesterday’s whine cellar and breathe a little fresh air.As for the Trump clan, maybe Donald, Ivanka and Jared can all just double-lock themselves inside the White House and keep pretending that they didn’t get the memo. More realistically, they need to go to a red state where they’ll be welcome. How about Kentucky? They would no doubt find sharing oxygen with their poorly educated MAGA fans a living hell, but at least they’d be invited to the local galas.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

During Monday’s White House COVID-19 Response Team Briefing, the CDC chief got brutally honest, going off the script and admitting she had a feeling of “impending doom” in terms of the future of the pandemic. Read on to hear her warning—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don’t miss these Signs Your Illness is Actually Coronavirus in Disguise. 1 Infections, Hospitalizations, and Deaths Are Increasing Dr. Walensky started off by reading the latest COVID-19 statistics. “We in the United States surpassed 30 million cases of COVID-19 CDC,” she said, noting that the new seven day average of new cases increased by 10 percent over the last to about 60,000 per day. “Hospitalizations have also increased,” she added, pointing out that deaths “which typically lag behind cases and hospitalizations have now started to rise” increasing nearly 3% to a seven day average of approximately 1000 deaths per day. 2 Dr. Walensky’s Truth: “Impending Doom” “When I first started at CDC, about two months ago, I made a promise to you. I would tell you the truth, even if it was not the news we wanted to hear,” she said. “Now is one of those times when I have to share the truth and I have to hope and trust, you will listen.”“I'm going to pause here. I'm going to lose the script. And I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,” she continued. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope. But right now, I am scared.” 3 “I Know What It Is Like” Walensky went on to detail what medical professionals like herself have been dealing with since the start of the pandemic. “I know what it's like as a physician to stand in that patient room, gowned, masked, shielded, and to be the last person to touch someone else's loved one because their loved one couldn't be there. I know what it's like when you're the physician, when you're the healthcare provider, and you're worried that you don't have the resources to take care of the patients in front of you. I know that feeling of nausea when you read the crisis standards of care, and you wonder whether they're going to be enough ventilators to go around and who's going to make that choice. And I know what it's like to pull up to your hospital every day and see the extra morgue sitting outside,” she said. 4 Just “Hold On a Little While Longer” She also pointed out that the end is near. “We have come such a long way, three historic scientific breakthrough vaccines,” she pointed out. “So I'm speaking today, not necessarily as your CDC director and not only as your CDC director, but as a wife, as a mother, as a daughter, to ask you to just please hold on a little while longer. I so badly want to be done. I know you all so badly want to be done. We are just almost there, but not quite yet. And so I'm asking you to just hold on a little longer to get vaccinated when you can so that all of those people that we all want will still be here.” 5 A Surge Is Happening She also pointed out that historically, the United State’s trajectory follows that of European countries, including Germany, Italy, and France, who are currently experiencing “a consistent and worrying spike in cases.” However, we have the power to turn things around, she points out. “We are not powerless. We can change this trajectory of a pandemic. But it will take all of us recommitting to following the public health prevention strategies consistently,” she said. “While we work to get the American public vaccinated, I'm calling on our elected officials, our faith-based communities, our civic leaders, and our other influencers in communities across the nation. And I'm calling on every single one of you to sound the alarm, to carry these messages into your community and your spheres of influence. We do not have the luxury of inaction for the health of our country. We must work together now to prevent a fourth surge.” 6 Do Your Part in Ending the Pandemic So follow Dr. Anthony Fauci’s fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live—wear a face mask that fits snugly and is double layered, don’t travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

Whites received 60.4% of shots and accounted for 60% of healthcare workers and 75% of nursing home residents.Data on race and ethnicity was only available on about half of the nearly 13 million vaccination shots given in the first month. New York City on Sunday reported that while Blacks made up 24% of the city's population, according to 2019 data, they have so far sought and received only 11% of coronavirus vaccinations.The data comes as top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on Monday urged all Americans to get vaccinated as soon as possible to not only protect themselves but to also prevent new variants of the virus from emerging. “You need to get vaccinated when it becomes available as quickly and as expeditiously as possible throughout the country and the reason for that is that there is a fact that permeates virology and that is that viruses cannot mutate if they don’t replicate and if you stop their replication by vaccinating widely and not giving the virus an open playing field to continue to respond to the pressures that you put on it, you will not get mutations.” Fauci’s comment came as the CDC reported that the variant first discovered in the UK was found in 32 states and another variant discovered in South Africa was found in 2 states – South Carolina and Maryland. The CDC also reported that January saw the highest number of deaths from COVID-19 than in any other month since the pandemic began – with more than 90,000 deaths… Though overall cases and hospitalizations nationwide are dropping from highs set last month.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

On Tuesday, the governments of the Czech Republic and Honduras confirmed that Israel had promised them each 5,000 vaccine doses manufactured by Moderna. The Israeli news media reported that Hungary and Guatemala would be sent a similar number, but the Hungarian and Israeli governments declined to comment, while the Guatemalan government did not respond to a request for comment. The donations are the latest example of a new expression of soft power: vaccine diplomacy, in which countries rich in vaccines seek to reward or sway those that have little access to them. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Jockeying for influence in Asia, China and India have donated thousands of vaccine doses to their neighbors. The United Arab Emirates has done the same for allies like Egypt. And last week, Israel even promised to buy tens of thousands of doses on behalf of the Syrian government, a longtime foe, in exchange for the return of an Israeli civilian detained in Syria. The vaccines allocated Tuesday were given without conditions, but they tacitly reward recent gestures from the receiving countries that implicitly accept Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital. Guatemala has moved its embassy to Jerusalem, while Honduras has pledged to do so. Hungary has set up a trade mission in Jerusalem, while the Czech Republic has promised to open a diplomatic office there. Israel has given at least one shot of the two-dose, Pfizer-manufactured vaccine to just over half its own population of 9 million — including to people living in Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories — making it the world leader in vaccine rollouts. That has left the Israeli government able to bolster its international relationships with its surplus supply of Moderna vaccines. But the move has angered Palestinians because it suggests that Israel’s allies are of greater priority than the Palestinians living under Israeli control in the occupied territories, almost all of whom have yet to receive a vaccine. Israel has pledged at least twice as many doses to faraway countries as it has so far promised to the nearly 5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Israeli government says that the Palestinian Authority was given responsibility for organizing its own health care system in the 1990s, after the signing of the Oslo Accords that gave the Palestinian leadership limited autonomy in parts of the occupied territories. Israel has given 2,000 vaccine doses to the Palestinian Authority and promised 3,000 more — token figures, given the size of the Palestinian population. And while Israel has hinted that more may come, it has yet to formalize any details. “A few weeks ago there were question marks about whether we had enough vaccines for our own people,” said Mark Regev, an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Now that it appears we do, we can be more forthcoming with our neighbors.” Regev added: “The virus won’t stop at the border, and we have a very strong interest that the Palestinians can be on top of this.” But Tuesday evening, an Israeli security official said that the military department that coordinates between Israel and the Palestinian leadership had not yet received government authorization to deliver more vaccines to the Palestinian Authority. In any case, human rights watchdogs say that Israel should organize a systematic vaccine program in the occupied territories, rather than sporadically deliver spares a few thousand at a time. They cite the Fourth Geneva Convention, which obliges an occupying power to coordinate with local authorities to maintain public health within an occupied territory, including during epidemics. The watchdog groups also note that the Israeli government not only controls all imports to the West Bank and Gaza but also, in recent submissions to the International Criminal Court, disputed Palestinian claims to sovereign statehood. “It is a system of oppression,” said Salem Barahmeh, executive director at the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, a Ramallah-based advocacy group. “It says a lot about a regime,” Barahmeh added, “that it is willing to send vaccines halfway across the world, potentially for a quid pro quo, and not offer the vaccine to the millions of Palestinians who live under the Israeli occupation.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': '04636e35e629f34bae0e3685cdeebe39', 'title': 'How Much Herd Immunity Is Enough?', 'description': 'At what point does a country achieve herd immunity? What portion of the population must acquire resistance to the coronavirus, either through infection or vaccination, in order for the disease to fade away and life to return to normal?Since the start of the pandemic, the figure that many epidemiologists have offered has been 60% to 70%. That range is still cited by the World Health Organization and is often repeated during discussions of the future course of the disease.Although it is impossible to know with certainty what the limit will be until we reach it and transmission stops, having a good estimate is important: It gives Americans a sense of when we can hope to breathe freely again.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesRecently, a figure to whom millions of Americans look for guidance -- Dr. Anthony Fauci, an adviser to both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration -- has begun incrementally raising his herd-immunity estimate.In the pandemic\'s early days, Fauci tended to cite the same 60% to 70% estimate that most experts did. About a month ago, he began saying "70, 75%" in television interviews. And last week, in an interview with CNBC News, he said "75, 80, 85%" and "75 to 80-plus percent."In a telephone interview the next day, Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks.Hard as it may be to hear, he said, he believes that it may take close to 90% immunity to bring the virus to a halt -- almost as much as is needed to stop a measles outbreak.Asked about Fauci\'s conclusions, prominent epidemiologists said that he might be proven right. The early range of 60% to 70% was almost undoubtedly too low, they said, and the virus is becoming more transmissible, so it will take greater herd immunity to stop it.Fauci said that weeks ago, he had hesitated to publicly raise his estimate because many Americans seemed hesitant about vaccines, which they would need to accept almost universally in order for the country to achieve herd immunity.Now that some polls are showing that many more Americans are ready, even eager, for vaccines, he said he felt he could deliver the tough message that the return to normal might take longer than anticipated."When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75%," Fauci said. "Then, when newer surveys said 60% or more would take it, I thought, \'I can nudge this up a bit,\' so I went to 80, 85.""We need to have some humility here," he added. "We really don\'t know what the real number is. I think the real range is somewhere between 70 to 90%. But, I\'m not going to say 90%."Doing so might be discouraging to Americans, he said, because he is not sure there will be enough voluntary acceptance of vaccines to reach that goal. Although sentiments about vaccines in polls have bounced up and down this year, several current ones suggest that about 20% of Americans say they are unwilling to accept any vaccine.Also, Fauci noted, a herd-immunity figure at 90% or above is in the range of the infectiousness of measles."I\'d bet my house that COVID isn\'t as contagious as measles," he said.Measles is thought to be the world\'s most contagious disease; it can linger in the air for hours or drift through vents to infect people in other rooms. In some studies of outbreaks in crowded military barracks and student dormitories, it has kept transmitting until more than 95% of all residents are infected.Interviews with epidemiologists regarding the degree of herd immunity needed to defeat the coronavirus produced a range of estimates, some of which were in line with Fauci\'s. They also came with a warning: All answers are merely "guesstimates.""You tell me what numbers to put in my equations, and I\'ll give you the answer," said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard\'s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "But you can\'t tell me the numbers, because nobody knows them."The only truly accurate measures of herd immunity are done in actual herds and come from studying animal viruses like rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, said Dr. David M. Morens, Fauci\'s senior adviser on epidemiology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.When cattle are penned in corrals, it is easy to measure how fast a disease spreads from one animal to another, he said. Humans move around, so studying disease spread among them is far harder.The original assumption that it would take 60% to 70% immunity to stop the disease was based on early data from China and Italy, health experts noted.Epidemiologists watching how fast cases doubled in those outbreaks calculated that the virus\' reproduction number, or R0 -- how many new victims each carrier infected -- was about 3. So two out of three potential victims would have to become immune before each carrier infected fewer than one. When each carrier infects fewer than one new victim, the outbreak slowly dies out.Two out of three is 66.7%, which established the range of 60% to 70% for herd immunity.Reinforcing that notion was a study conducted by the French military on the crew of the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, which had an outbreak in late March, said Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the University of Washington\'s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The study found that 1,064 of the 1,568 sailors aboard, or about 68%, had tested positive for the virus.But the carrier returned to port while the outbreak was still in progress, and the crew went into quarantine, so it was unclear whether the virus was finished infecting new sailors even after 68% had caught it.Also, outbreaks aboard ships are poor models for those on land because infections move much faster in the close quarters of a vessel than in a free-roaming civilian population, said Dr. Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida.More important, the early estimates from Wuhan and Italy were later revised upward, Lipsitch noted, once Chinese scientists realized they had undercounted the number of victims of the first wave. It took about two months to be certain that there were many asymptomatic people who had also spread the virus.It also became clearer later that "superspreader events," in which one person infects dozens or even hundreds of others, played a large role in spreading COVID-19. Such events, in "normal" populations -- in which no one wears masks and everyone attends events like parties, basketball tournaments or Broadway shows -- can push the reproduction number upward to 4, 5 or even 6, experts said. Consequently, those scenarios call for higher herd immunity; for example, at an R0 of 5, more than 4 out of 5 people, or 80%, must be immune to slow down the virus.Further complicating matters, there is a growing consensus among scientists that the virus itself is becoming more transmissible. A variant "Italian strain" with the mutation known as D614G has spread much faster than the original Wuhan variant. A newly identified mutation, sometimes called N501Y, that may make the virus even more infectious has recently appeared in Britain, South Africa and elsewhere.The more transmissible a pathogen, the more people must become immune in order to stop it.Morens and Lipsitch agreed with Fauci that the level of herd immunity needed to stop COVID-19 could be 85% or higher."But that\'s a guesstimate," Lipsitch emphasized."Tony\'s reading the tea leaves," Morens said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers no herd immunity estimate, saying on its website that "experts do not know."Although WHO scientists still sometimes cite the older 60% to 70% estimate, Dr. Katherine O\'Brien, the agency\'s director of immunization, said that she now thought that range was too low. She declined to estimate what the correct higher one might be."We\'d be leaning against very thin reeds if we tried to say what level of vaccine coverage would be needed to achieve it," she said. "We should say we just don\'t know. And it won\'t be a world or even national number. It will depend on what community you live in."Dean noted that to stop transmission in a crowded city like New York, more people would have to achieve immunity than would be necessary in a less crowded place like Montana.Even if Fauci is right and it will take 85% or even 90% herd immunity to completely stop coronavirus transmission, Lipsitch said, "we can still defang the virus sooner than that."He added: "We don\'t have to have zero transmission in order to have a decent society. We have lots of diseases, like flu, transmitting all the time, and we don\'t shut down society for that. If we can vaccinate almost all the people who are most at risk of severe outcomes, then this would become a milder disease."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Two weeks later, a case was recorded in Thailand. One week after that, on or about Jan. 20, 2020 (the records of various official sources differ slightly on the exact day), the first case was confirmed in the U.S.Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study earlier this month that revealed the findings of an investigation of thousands of blood donation samples collected by the Red Cross between Dec. 13, 2019, and Jan. 19, 2020.The CDC\'s conclusion suggests that our current timeline may not be so accurate.In this  Dec. 8, 2020, file photo, a healthcare worker wears personal protective equipment as she speaks to a patient at a mobile testing location for COVID-19 in Auburn, Maine. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)Of the more than 7,300 blood donation samples tested by the CDC, 106 specimens showed evidence of coronavirus antibodies. From those 106, a group of 84 samples that underwent further testing possessed the specific protein structure needed to block SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, from entering cells.Dr. Natalie Thornburg, a respiratory viruses immunologist and one of the researchers involved with the study, told AccuWeather that while they can\'t be 100% certain that all the antibodies are a result of SARS-CoV-2, their extensive testing makes that "very likely.""In that original manuscript we did find one that had a very, very, very high signal, and blocked the piece of the protein from the virus from binding the cell protein at a very high percentage. It also blocked virus entry into the cells, so that one is very likely from a SARS-2 infection," Thornburg said, referring to one of the antibodies in the sample. "I believe there was another one that also was positive, that one may be likely as well. But even with the 84, we are not able to say with 100% certainty they are all from SARS-2 infections."Despite the absence of certainty, the overwhelming evidence pushed the researchers to conclude that their data does indeed "suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have been introduced into the United States prior to January 19, 2020."This 2020 electron microscope image made available by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the spherical particles of the new coronavirus, colorized blue, from the first U.S. case of COVID-19. Antibody blood tests for the coronavirus could play a key role in deciding whether millions of Americans can safely return to work and school. But public health officials warn that the current "Wild West" of unregulated tests is creating confusion that could ultimately slow the path to recovery. (Hannah A. Bullock, Azaibi Tamin/CDC via AP)The results were both surprising and not surprising, Thornburg said. While she said the uncovering of positive antibodies wasn\'t shocking, the number of blood samples with such antibodies and the areas in which they came from were a surprise.The blood samples came from donors in nine states: California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. From those states, Thornburg was particularly surprised by the cluster coming from Northern California.CLICK HERE FOR THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP"I was surprised by the number from Northern California in December. I think it was like 2.6% from Northern California in December," Thornburg said. "That\'s not to say that there were 2.6% of people from California who had the infection, this is not a representative sample and you can\'t extrapolate a number of the specimens we saw to the general population, but I was surprised by that number," she said. "And I was surprised by the number we saw the neutralizing, the 84."Thornburg said that the positives weren\'t surprising because of how quickly the positive infections were confirmed in January once officials began looking. The turnaround between the start of CDC testing on Jan. 18 and the first patient being identified days later shows that the virus had established prevalence in the country at that point, she said.A health worker organizes coronavirus antibody test results at an office in Bali, Indonesia on Friday, Sept. 11, 2020. (AP Photo/Firdia Lisnawati)If that initial confirmed infection on Jan. 20 truly was the first American patient, "It would\'ve been like [finding] a needle in a haystack," she said.The recently published data gives epidemiologists some more potential clarity, but it also raises a number of other questions: Namely, why didn\'t we see the high rates of transmission in December and January that we later saw in March and April?Hong Kong University pathology professor John Nicholls raised that query in an email with AccuWeather and further suggested that more analysis of those Red Cross blood donors would need to be completed in order to better understand the findings."CDC is normally very robust in their methodology, but from a clinical point of view, if the virus was circulating before, given what we know about the infectiousness of the virus, why did these mystery patients not show any clinical symptoms, or transmit to other people, or lead to further outbreaks?" Nicholls wondered in his email.In this Sunday, Jan. 26, 2020 file photo, Gao Fu, foreground left, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks to journalists after a news conference about a virus outbreak at the State Council Information Office in Beijing. On Dec. 31, 2019, Gao dispatched a team of experts to Wuhan. Also on Dec. 31, the World Health Organization first learned about the cases from an open-source platform that scouts for intelligence on outbreaks, emergencies chief Michael Ryan has said. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)Dr. George Rutherford, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, raised similar questions in an exclusive interview with AccuWeather. Regarding the results of the study, he said he viewed the data "as a lab artifact" and said it was hard to believe the findings of studies that push the timeline back too far."I think that I could give you early January or maybe late December, but we would have seen lots and lots and lots of disease and lots of mortality that would not have escaped detection," he said.If given the opportunity to learn more about the publication\'s data, Rutherford said that he would most like to understand more about the donors\' travel histories and geographic information."It\'d be very compelling if it turned out to be a bunch of positive cases of 35-year-old Asian-American businessmen who go back and forth from China all the time," Rutherford said. "Then that becomes a believable story. But if it\'s an 80-year-old grandmother living in Des Moines, Iowa, with no contact at all, then that\'s a much tougher sell."In this Feb. 29, 2020 file photo, President Donald Trump, accompanied by, from left, National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, Vice President Mike Pence, and Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reacts to a question during a news conference on the coronavirus in the press briefing room at the White House in Washington. Public health officials were already warning Americans about the need to prepare for the coronavirus threat in early February when President Donald Trump called it "deadly stuff" in a private conversation that has only now has come to light. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)Dr. Bryan Lewis of the University of Virginia\'s Biocomplexity Institute told AccuWeather that he believes the CDC findings paint a grimmer picture of the pandemic than what is officially known. \xa0"What we\'re looking at now is a vast underestimate in terms of the total number of people we\'ve lost," Lewis, who early on warned that the coronavirus could unleash widespread dire consequences, said. "I think that the impact of this has not been fully appreciated."Regarding the transmission, or lack thereof, of those early December coronavirus patients, Thornburg said it isn\'t abundantly clear why higher transmission rates weren\'t occurring. She postulated that the infected individuals may not have attended super spreader events or engaged in close contact with large crowds of people, but without more information about the patients, that remains unclear.With vaccines now being distributed across the country, more than 18 million cases and nearly 320,000 fatalities later, Thornburg said she is hoping her team\'s discoveries spur other researchers to reanalyze their specimens to continue piecing together a timeline that would go on to reshape the entire national understanding of how the pandemic unfolded."It\'s one piece to the puzzle," Thornburg said. "I hope other scientists, if they have things in their freezer they can look at and have different ways of looking at it, I hope they can go into their freezers and look at samples to see if they have some other pieces of the puzzle that can sort of fill out the picture."Additional reporting by Bill Wadell.Keep checking back on\xa0AccuWeather.com\xa0and stay tuned to the\xa0AccuWeather Network on DirecTV, Frontier and Verizon Fios.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '64ea3d3c8a7aa1f5be4395e9e4889a46', 'title': 'A Few COVID Vaccine Recipients Developed a Rare Blood Disorder', 'description': 'One day after receiving her first dose of Moderna’s COVID vaccine, Luz Legaspi, 72, woke up with bruises on her arms and legs, and blisters that bled inside her mouth. She was hospitalized in New York City that day, Jan. 19, with a severe case of immune thrombocytopenia — a lack of platelets, a blood component essential for clotting. The same condition led to the death in January of Dr. Gregory Michael, 56, an obstetrician in Miami Beach whose symptoms appeared three days after he received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Treatments failed to restore his platelets, and after two weeks in the hospital he died from a brain hemorrhage. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times It is not known whether this blood disorder is related to the COVID vaccines. More than 31 million people in the United States have received at least one dose, and 36 similar cases had been reported to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS, by the end of January. The cases involved either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, the only two authorized so far for emergency use in the United States. But the reporting system shows only problems described by health care providers or patients after vaccination and does not indicate whether the shots actually caused the problems. Officials with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that they were looking into the reports, but that so far, rates of the condition in vaccinated people did not appear higher than the rates normally found in the U.S. population, so the cases could be coincidental. Overall, the vaccines are considered safe. A small number of severe allergic reactions have been reported, but they are treatable, and the rates are in line with those reported for other vaccines, regulators say. In a statement, Pfizer said: “We take reports of adverse events very seriously” and added that it was aware of thrombocytopenia cases in vaccine recipients. The statement also said: “We are collecting relevant information to share with the FDA. However, at this time, we have not been able to establish a causal association with our vaccine.” Moderna also provided a statement, which did not address the question of the platelet disorder but said the company “continuously monitors the safety of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine using all sources of data” and routinely shares safety information with regulators. Hematologists with expertise in treating immune thrombocytopenia said they suspected that the vaccine did play a role. But they said that cases after vaccination were likely to be exceedingly rare, possibly the result of an unknown predisposition in some people to react to the vaccine by developing an immune response that destroys their platelets. The disorder has occurred, rarely, in people who received other inoculations, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella one. “I think it is possible that there is an association,” Dr. James Bussel, a hematologist and professor emeritus at Weill Cornell Medicine who has written more than 300 scientific articles on the platelet disorder, said. “I’m assuming there’s something that made the people who developed thrombocytopenia susceptible, given what a tiny percentage of recipients they are.” He added: “Having it happen after a vaccine is well-known and has been seen with many other vaccines. Why it happens, we don’t know.” Bussel said it was important to share information about the cases, because severe thrombocytopenia can be serious, and physicians need to know how to treat it. Sometimes the condition resists standard therapies, and if very low platelet counts persist, the patient faces an increasing risk of severe bleeding and even brain hemorrhage. He and a colleague, Dr. Eun-Ju Lee, have submitted an article to a medical journal on 15 cases in COVID vaccine recipients they identified by searching the government’s database or by consulting with other physicians treating patients. The report provides information about treatments and urges doctors to report cases. It also notes that it is too soon to tell whether the affected patients will have lasting recoveries or recurrences of the platelet problem. A few of the patients had previously had platelet disorders or other autoimmune conditions that might have made them vulnerable, Bussel said. People can have low platelets without symptoms, and it is possible that in some, a vaccine reaction could drop the level further, to a point where it becomes apparent by causing bruises or bleeding, Bussel said. He has been a paid consultant to Pfizer, not on vaccines but for a drug for the platelet disorder. Dr. Jerry L. Spivak, an expert on blood disorders at Johns Hopkins University, also said the connection to the vaccine appeared real but predicted that cases would be exceedingly rare and called them “idiosyncratic,” perhaps related to underlying traits in individual patients. The cases are not a reason to avoid COVID vaccination, doctors say. The risk of serious illness from the coronavirus is much greater than the risk of developing this rare condition, and the vaccines are crucial for controlling the pandemic. Legaspi’s daughter said the last thing that she and her mother wanted to do was create fear of the COVID vaccines. Both women still believe strongly in the need for them, despite Legaspi’s illness, her daughter said. The daughter asked, at her employer’s request, that her name not be used. In its most common form, immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease that affects about 50,000 people in the United States, according to a support group for patients. The condition develops when the immune system attacks platelets or the cells that create them, for unknown reasons. It sometimes follows a viral illness, and can persist for months or become chronic and last for years. It is generally treatable. Professional groups have advised that patients with the disorder be vaccinated for COVID, but after consulting with their hematologists. Legaspi was strong and in good health before receiving the Moderna vaccine. But when she was admitted to the city hospital in Queens, New York, her platelet count was zero. Normal readings range from 150,000 to 450,000, and anything under 10,000 is considered very dangerous and in urgent need of treatment. Doctors ordered Legaspi to not even get out of bed without help, for fear that if she fell and injured herself she could hemorrhage. They began giving her the standard treatments, including platelet transfusions along with steroids and immune globulins meant to stop her immune system’s war on her platelets. Nothing worked. Her platelets would rise a bit and then crash again between treatments. As the days passed with no progress, Legaspi’s daughter, aware of Michael’s death, worried increasingly that her mother would suffer a brain hemorrhage. “I don’t think she understands she’s like a ticking bomb,” the daughter said in an interview Jan. 28, after her mother had been in the hospital for more than week with no improvement. “I don’t use the term. I don’t want to tell her that.” Legaspi, from the Philippines, speaks only some English but understood that her condition was serious, said the daughter. Bussel heard about her condition and, although he works at a different hospital, he called her doctor Jan. 28 and offered to consult on Legaspi’s care. He also contacted Michael’s family to ask what treatments he had received — partly as a way of finding out what had not worked. Michael’s death had come to public attention after his wife, Heidi Neckelmann, disclosed it on Facebook. Neckelmann said in a text, “I am glad that Dr. Bussel reached out to me. I told my story with the intention of helping those in the same or similar situation.” She added: “I hope that other people can now benefit with Dr. Bussel’s experience. I wish my Gregory had had that chance.” On Jan. 29, Bussel sent Legaspi’s physician, Dr. Niriksha Chandrani, an email labeled “my strong recommendations,” noting that he was “very afraid” Legaspi would have a brain hemorrhage and advising a different course of treatment. Chandrani, chief of oncology at Elmhurst, realized that Bussel was a leading authority on the platelet disorder, and she took his advice. She had spent several sleepless nights worrying about Legaspi. “I didn’t want her to die,” Chandrani said. A day later, Legaspi’s platelet count had reached 6,000: “slow but steady progress,” Bussel said. The next morning, it was 40,000, which took her out of the highest danger zone. Two days later, Feb. 1, it was 71,000. It is impossible to tell whether the new treatments worked, if the initial ones kicked in or if she recovered on her own. But Feb. 2, she went home from the hospital to the apartment in Queens that she shares with her daughter and 7-year-old grandson. On Feb. 4, her daughter said, Legaspi’s platelet count was 293,000. Another vaccine recipient, Sarah C., 48, a teacher in Arlington, Texas, received the Moderna vaccine Jan. 3. She asked that her full name not be used to protect her privacy. Two weeks later, she began to have heavy vaginal bleeding. After two days she saw her obstetrician, who ordered blood work and scheduled other tests. A few hours later, he called and urged her to go straight to the emergency room. He was stunned and hoped it was a lab error, but her blood count showed zero platelets. She had a checkup with completely normal blood-test results less than a week before being vaccinated. The reading of zero platelets was not a lab error. The results were confirmed in the emergency room, and doctors there also noticed red spots on her wrists and ankles, caused by hemorrhages under the skin. Sarah C. had seen the spots but ignored them. She spent four days in the hospital, receiving platelet transfusions, immune globulins and steroids to restore her platelet count. She described the experience as terrifying. “Especially when people say they’d never seen this before, that you could bleed out or hemorrhage,” she said. “That was the biggest concern, and just not knowing. The gentleman in Florida, he didn’t make it. Certainly the fear was there.” Even so, she said: “I’m all for the vaccine. I had a terrible horrible reaction and just hope people are aware of what to do if something happens, to watch for these symptoms and get help immediately.” If she had known enough to recognize the red spots and bleeding as danger signs, she said, she would have gone to the emergency room much sooner. Recently, she received a notice saying it was time for her second shot of the Moderna vaccine. Her doctors have said she could go ahead and take it, but she decided to wait, though she said she did want another dose. “I don’t know if I’ll do the same one,” she said. “Maybe a different one.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The biggest dilemmas are Eric Soskin, the inspector general for the Transportation Department, and Brian Miller, a former Trump White House lawyer appointed earlier in 2020 to look for abuses in pandemic spending. "Nearly all inspectors general since Congress created the independent anti-corruption watchdog positions in 1978 were confirmed unanimously or by voice vote without recorded opposition," but only one Democrat voted to confirm Miller, the Times reports. Along with the objections he was too close to Trump, Miller has faced scrutiny for apparently doing little in his first eight months, though he submitted a report to Congress on Monday outlining some investigative work. "I try to be bipartisan and nonpartisan — certainly as an inspector general and in everything that I do," Miller told the Times. Soskin\'s office, meanwhile, was investigating whether Trump\'s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, had improperly steered federal grants to Kentucky to help the re-election of her husband, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). In December, McConnell, then majority leader, used his power to prioritize Soskin\'s confirmation over four other inspector general nominees ahead of him in line, the Times reports, ensuring that a Republican appointee would control the office once Biden took office. Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, flagged McConnell\'s move a the time. Oh I should have also mentioned that the alleged wrongdoing involves the Sec of Transportation trying to help her husband McConnell, yes the same person who is trying to push through the confirmation today. — Danielle Brian (@daniellebrian) December 18, 2020 It took McConnell two tries, but on Dec. 21 he eventually got Soskin confirmed 48-47, the first ever party-line vote for an inspector general. Despite the evident conflict of interest, Brian said removing Soskin and other Trump-appointed inspectors general "would be essentially exacerbating the problems he created in the first place." Soskin declined through a spokesman to comment on the status of his office\'s Chao-McConnell investigation. A spokesman for McConnell pointed to a 2019 statement in which McConnell openly touted his ability to funnel federal dollars to Kentucky.

{'_id': '1f35a87183ae7c4438da81a32849f285', 'title': 'They Were on Equal Footing. Then the Ground Shifted.', 'description': 'Robin Arnone, a part-time trainer before the coronavirus pandemic, hasn’t set foot in the Colosseum Gym in Columbia, Maryland, since the virus shut it down almost a year ago. The gym is open again, but she doesn’t need the work. Things are going gangbusters in her other job as a home appraiser, and she hasn’t looked back. For Julie Stark, one of Arnone’s best friends and a professional dog walker, things are not so rosy. With many clients stuck at home in the pandemic and taking care of their own pets, her services are no longer in demand. Instead of walking seven dogs each day, she now walks three. Stark has had to economize, eliminating dance and gymnastics classes for her children to save $350 a month. She doesn’t know when her clients will want her back, but it’s not something she discusses with Arnone. “We don’t talk about money,” Stark said. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It would be awkward if she were a dog walker and doing unbelievably well,” she added. “I’m happy for her.” And there is a lot in Arnone’s life to be happy about. She replaced her used Lexus with a new one last year, and in December she indulged herself with a $550 Dyson hair dryer. “It felt a little ridiculous,” she said of the purchase. “But I worked hard, and if there’s any year I’m going to do it, it’s this year.” Arnone and Stark are among the millions of friends who were on a relatively equal financial footing before last March — people who would have thought nothing of splitting the check on a night out — and now find themselves on vastly different trajectories. Lockdowns changed what Americans can do as well as what services they need, and in the process created divergent fates for many workers. The pandemic has wreaked havoc on many who were already struggling. Nearly 10 million fewer people have jobs, and some 26 million reported not always having enough to eat, according to Census Bureau data. For the 50% or so of the population that makes up the middle class — defined by Pew Research Center as having an income ranging from around $45,000 to $135,000 for a household of three — the toll has been uneven. Like a tornado, the pandemic can devastate one household and leave neighboring ones unscathed. Arnone’s world, in the Washington-Baltimore area, exemplifies that. The gym where she worked, the Colosseum, is owned by her friend Tim Gallagher. His monthly income at the gym is down 25 to 30%, and a quarter of the gym’s members have suspended their accounts. To save money, he has lowered the thermostat at home to 60 degrees from 65, and while his truck has more than 340,000 miles on it, he has no plans to replace it. “You just got to scrape along and gut it out,” he said. “We’re really struggling to get by.” But in Arnone’s other field, home appraising, her friends and colleagues are reaping rewards from the booming housing market, where January sales were up 23.7% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Ultralow mortgage rates have prompted a wave of refinancings, which require fresh appraisals. “I don’t have much to complain about,” said Traci Warner, a friend of Arnone’s and a home appraiser in Waldorf, Maryland, south of Washington. After her husband was laid off from his sales job in April, Warner’s work picked up the slack. It’s not that things are perfect, but unlike Gallagher, she does not feel that she is barely hanging on. This contrast is mirrored in the larger economy. Weekly unemployment claims by newly laid-off workers remain at historically elevated levels even as stock indexes reach record highs. Vaccines have arrived, but their slow rollout means it will be months before anything resembling normal activity can resume at restaurants, hotels, gyms, airports, malls and other businesses that depend on bringing people together. “It’s very uneven,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a forecasting and research group. “The recovery for the most vulnerable parts of the population will take years.” Not only are wages and salaries down for the hardest-hit segments of the workforce, he noted, but so are overall employment and participation in the labor force. At the very top, the gains have been staggering. In eight months after the pandemic hit the United States, the wealth of the country’s roughly 650 billionaires grew by $1 trillion, according to a November study by the Institute for Policy Studies and other progressive groups. That included a $70 billion lift for just one of those magnates: the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. White-collar employees, having emerged mostly unscathed from the sharp downturn in 2020, are looking forward to what they hope will be a robust recovery in 2021 once most people are vaccinated. Service workers, devastated by the idling of entire industries amid lockdowns and other restrictions, just want the pain to abate. The split was evident in the latest jobs report from the Labor Department. While professional and business services employment jumped by 97,000 in January, that job growth was almost entirely offset in the private sector by losses in the retail, leisure and hospitality industries, among others. So while lines at food banks lengthen, new Teslas dot parking lots, and there are waiting lists for Peloton machines so the most fortunate can keep up with their workouts from home. Peter Atwater, a lecturer in economics at the College of William & Mary, has popularized a term for this phenomenon: the K-shaped recovery. While one arm of the K ascends, the other is driving lower. “There’s an enormous divide in confidence,” he said. “And we buy and spend based on how we feel.” Janet Yellen, the newly confirmed Treasury secretary, extended the metaphor during her confirmation hearings. “We are living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built upon wealth, while working families fell farther and farther behind,” she said. Life on the Upside Arnone misses her days at the gym, especially spending time with clients. It is the first time since she was 15 that she hasn’t worked as a trainer, she said. But she is feeling pretty good otherwise. Before the pandemic, she would train people in the morning and shift to her real estate work in the afternoon. Now she rises at 6 a.m. to start writing up appraisals before hitting the road to visit as many as eight homes in a day. “I’ve declined a boatload of appraisal jobs,” she said. “I just didn’t have the time.” After typically handling 500 appraisals a year, she did 635 last year. She is paid by the banks that issue the mortgages, and last year, she estimates, she earned roughly $250,000 for her services, up from about $185,000 in previous years. She lives in Woodbine, Maryland, 25 miles west of Baltimore, and although she still thinks of herself as middle class, she said her nieces told her she was upper middle class; she concedes that they’re probably right. It’s a world away from the apartment where she grew up in Randallstown, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, as the child of a single mother. “Thinking back, I had no clue,” Arnone said. “I didn’t realize how much we didn’t have. If I wanted something, my mom would go without, but I didn’t have the nicest clothes or the name brands.” Maybe that’s why she feels a little ashamed of her good fortune when she sees news stories about long lines at food banks or other evidence of the pandemic’s economic woes. “When I throw out the veggies I never got to eat, my mother’s Catholic guilt weighs on me,” she said. Home appraisal is a boom-and-bust business, driven by the housing market’s cycles. But with interest rates near record lows, and new buyers shopping for houses while existing homeowners refinance, work is plentiful for now. Warner — Arnone’s friend and fellow home appraiser — traded in her Honda Accord, which had more than 300,000 miles on it, for a 2017 BMW X3, not long ago, and was able to go to the beach in Delaware with her family last summer. This month, they went skiing in Virginia. “Our finances are pretty good,” added Warner, 51. “The market has been amazing.” Arnone, by her own description, is a worrywart and had done her training work on the side to supplement her income. Now she doesn’t feel the need. “The gym was always my safe place, and it’s weird not seeing Tim and other friends — I miss them,” she said. “But I won’t lie. It’s nice to have more time and more flexibility.” The Long Wait for Normal A year ago, Stark felt things were going her way. Five years earlier, she started a business as a dog walker and pet sitter, after having been a veterinary technician. “It was perfect,” she said, until the pandemic arrived. Now her clients are home and can walk their dogs themselves. And the decline in travel leaves little need for pet sitters. “I’m holding out hope that my clients will need me again,” she said. She has been surviving with help from her parents, child support from her ex-husband and unemployment benefits. Stark has her hands full with her own pets in the meantime. She has two rescue dogs, Roxy and Luke, as well as two cats. Everyone, she adds, gets along. She did get one new client during the pandemic, but most of the so-called pandemic puppies adopted in the past 11 months are being walked by their owners or their children, she said. She isn’t sure whether her old clients will come back when the pandemic recedes or she will be walking the new dogs. Sometimes she thinks of returning to a 9-to-5 job outside the house. “Part of me just wants a stable job and a regular paycheck,” she said. It doesn’t seem realistic, though: With her two daughters, ages 10 and 14, in school remotely, she needs to be at home most of the time. “I’m just hoping things will return to normal,” she said. Government aid has been crucial for helping people like Stark and Gallagher weather the pandemic. And their reliance on it underscores why many economists believe more federal assistance is necessary, especially if the K-shaped recovery continues. “Political leaders and policymakers have a big role to play in getting that bottom leg of the K up,” Daco of Oxford Economics said. “They hold the key to a stronger labor-market recovery that is as inclusive as possible and will reduce the long-term damage to the economy.” Gallagher, the owner of the Colosseum Gym, recently applied for a second round of small-business loans. That, and forbearance from his landlord, should enable him to keep Colosseum open in the months ahead. Still, he is not expecting an imminent recovery. “I think it’s going to take till the end of the year,” he said. “We’re allowed to operate at 50% of capacity. But I don’t have to worry about 50% because everybody is scared to death to come in.” The warnings from Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, haven’t helped business, Gallagher added. “His COVID briefings are deadly to my gym,” he joked. “Every time he opens his mouth, another five or six people put their memberships on hold.” In the meantime, Gallagher’s decisions reflect the continuing economic pain. He has laid off most of his part-time employees. Normally, he and his wife would go out several times a week, but now one outing is the limit. “That’s a big splurge for us,” he said. They have also dropped premium channels from their cable service. At the gym, a popular gathering spot for hard-core weightlifters, the clanging of the machines has been replaced by background music and the whirring of the treadmills occupied by the most devoted exercisers. And public health officials have warned that high-intensity workout sessions at gyms can spread the coronavirus, potentially threatening Colosseum’s revival. Gallagher said there was little personal training going on. Maybe five or six guests are out on the floor while Gallagher keeps himself busy cleaning up and fixing equipment. Every so often, he signs up a new member, with dues running at $59 a month. He is confident that eventually — on the other side of the pandemic — people will want to come back to the gym. Not everyone, though. He is concerned that members who have fallen out of the gym habit may never return. “It’s going to take longer to make up for those memberships and get other people to join,” he said. “A few people will never want to go to the gym, or the movies or where there are crowds of people. It’s a shame.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

While things seem to be turning around after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced all doses would be released and said states should expand who they are vaccinating, some areas are still struggling. This week has seen tumult in Mississippi with its State Health Department (MSDH) announcing on Wednesday, Jan. 13 that it has run out of its current supply of the vaccine. "The Mississippi State Department of Health had a vaccine distribution plan in place that has been significantly altered in the last few days—especially in the last 24 hours," the MSDH said in a statement on its website. Now, it\'ll be weeks before Mississippi can vaccinate more eligible individuals against COVID-19. Read on to find out what went wrong, and for a bleak warning from the company making the coronavirus vaccine, check out The Moderna CEO Just Made This Scary Prediction About COVID.Read the original article on Best Life. Mississippi had expanded who could get vaccinated on Jan. 12. In the wake of the HHS announcement, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said on Tuesday, Jan. 12 that Mississippians over the age of 65 and those over 18 with underlying medical conditions would be permitted to receive vaccinations. Reeves urged residents to sign up to get vaccinated, but the demand was higher than expected. And for more on the latest vaccine news, check out These Are the Side Effects of the New Johnson&Johnson Vaccine. But it didn\'t take long for every appointment to get filled. The public response led to both the MSDH\'s online platform and the state\'s vaccination hotline being quickly overwhelmed. "Neither the county health department drive-through sites, nor the [University of Mississippi Medical Center] vaccine scheduling website was designed to accommodate the monumental surge we are currently experiencing," the MSDH wrote in its Jan. 13 statement. "At this time, we have no additional vaccine, and every appointment is tied to an actual vaccination."State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs, MD, told the Biloxi Sun Herald that 52,000 residents were due to receive vaccinations over the next two weeks. And for more on prepping for the vaccine, know that If You Take These OTC Meds, You Have to Stop Before Getting the Vaccine. The state doesn\'t expect new vaccine shipments until mid-February. All vaccine doses currently in the state\'s possession are earmarked for specific appointments, with no spare capacity currently available for residents who are eligible but have not yet booked an appointment for their vaccination."The Mississippi State Department of Health hopes to receive a large shipment of vaccine in mid-February that should help put additional shots in people\'s arms," the MSDH\'s statement continued. "We understand the frustration brought on by this sudden change of plans." And for more regular COVID updates, sign up for our daily newsletter. Mississippi is currently having a severe COVID outbreak. On Jan. 9, Mississippi experienced its highest-ever daily number of new COVID-19 cases, with 3,203 new cases reported. As of Jan. 14, according to Covid Act Now, the state is seeing a "very dangerous number of new cases" at 75.2 per 100,000 residents, its positive test rate of 15.1 percent "indicates insufficient testing," and with 85 percent of its ICU capacity used, Mississippi is at "high risk of hospital overload."

{'_id': 'e07a8891e8dd660524bce3da82f09e25', 'title': 'How Flu Shots Can Help in the Fight Against COVID', 'description': 'While we anxiously await the development and approval of a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19, there\'s another health-sparing and lifesaving vaccine already available to nearly everyone over the age of 6 months.Yes, that\'s the flu vaccine, offered as an annual event that not nearly enough people partake in. The excuses are numerous, ranging from "I never get the flu" to "I had the vaccine once and still got the flu."The latter excuse is especially telling, reflecting a widespread misunderstanding of the nature and effectiveness of influenza vaccines that could carry over to any of the novel coronavirus vaccines that may reach the U.S. market.In general, flu vaccines are on average 50% effective in preventing infection by the main strains of influenza virus expected to be circulating in the country in the coming flu season, usually November or December to April or May. Flu vaccines are administered annually for two main reasons: 1) flu viruses mutate readily and the mix of viral strains varies from year to year, and 2) even if the viruses don\'t change significantly, immunity against them gradually wanes and may be all but gone by the next flu season.Be prepared, folks. A COVID-19 vaccine may be no different. "If a vaccine was developed that is 50% effective in preventing COVID, it would still be licensed," Michael Osterholm, infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, told me. "Of course, we\'d like a higher degree of effectiveness, but as with the flu vaccine, 50% protection is better than zero. A COVID vaccine probably won\'t be nearly as effective as the childhood vaccines we\'re familiar with," Osterholm said.Thus, even after being immunized against COVID-19, we may still have to practice social distancing, wear masks in public, wash our hands often and limit indoor gatherings until and unless this too-often lethal virus "disappears," as President Donald Trump once predicted it would. On the plus side, these protective measures against COVID should also help to limit the spread of influenza. Indoors or out, masks can reduce the airborne transmission of both viral diseases, which spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings.Since we already know that the antibodies people develop following a coronavirus infection seem to wane with time, there\'s a good chance that any COVID vaccine will need to be administered repeatedly, perhaps annually, to provide adequate protection. Unlike the flu, COVID-19 has shown no evidence of having a season. Whether the weather is hot, cold, dry or wet, this coronavirus is highly infectious. But like the flu, it spreads readily from person to person and can be transmitted even before those infected know they are contagious. It can also be transmitted by those who are infected and don\'t become noticeably ill.Another fact worth noting: the flu vaccine does not and cannot cause the flu. Some people may get a feverish reaction to a flu shot, but that may represent in part the body\'s effort to muster an immune response. Or, as Osterholm pointed out, those who get the flu within a few days of being immunized may actually have another respiratory bug or may have already been infected with the flu virus when they got the shot. Flu viruses typically have an incubation period of one to four days before symptoms develop, and it takes about two weeks for the vaccine to become fully protective.However, even if people do get the flu after being properly immunized, the illness is likely to be significantly less severe. This may also be the case with a COVID vaccine.Experts are currently most worried about a likely confluence this winter of a flu epidemic and a still-raging COVID-19 pandemic, which could easily overwhelm the medical care system and create anew a shortage of hospital beds and personal protective equipment. Pneumonia is a not-uncommon complication of the flu that could add to the burden of hospitalizations needed for people with a life-threatening coronavirus infection.The experts are also concerned about people who develop the flu and, thinking it could be COVID, seek medical care and a test that could inadvertently expose them to this dreaded virus as well as cause a shortage of tests. Both ailments can produce similar symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue that can be extreme.Another worrisome possibility is that people who get the flu might be even more susceptible to contracting the coronavirus and to developing severe disease.Even discounting an increased risk of COVID-19, the complications of flu can be serious. They include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and a worsening of chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and congestive heart failure. Others at increased risk of serious flu-related complications include people 65 and older, pregnant women and children younger than 5.So who should be getting a flu shot? Not children younger than 6 months or people with certain medical conditions that may include those with a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome or a prior severe allergic reaction to flu vaccine. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most people with an egg allergy can safely get a flu shot. The vaccine contains inactivated virus so it is safe for those who should not be immunized with a live virus vaccine. But it\'s best not to get a flu shot when you are not feeling well.Some forms of flu vaccine are approved only for use in adults. For example, the recombinant influenza vaccine Flublok Quadrivalent, which does not use viruses grown in eggs, is suitable for those 18 years and older.For people 65 and older, a three-component inactivated vaccine called Fluzone High-Dose is available and covered by Medicare. It is especially recommended for people living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. It contains four times the level of antigen needed to provoke an immune response than is found in standard-dose flu vaccines. According to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the high-dose vaccine was 24.2% more effective in preventing flu in older adults than the standard-dose vaccine. Another study, published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, found that the use of the high-dose vaccine reduced the risk of respiratory-related hospitalization among nursing home residents.In general, October is the ideal time to get a flu shot to help provide protection that lasts throughout the coming season, since the effects may wane with time. Given the pandemic, September might work better this year, but as my doctor told me, the best time to get it is when you can.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Temperatures over much of the state remained below freezing on Tuesday, and more ice and snow were expected through Thursday morning.Public health officials in Dallas, Houston, Austin, and other cities postponed planned vaccination events or individual appointments until at least the end of the week, saying the injections would restart once travel conditions were less dangerous. Officials in Hays County were focusing on second doses rescheduled for the end of the week at a local high school and pushing first doses to next week.“Local providers have postponed vaccine clinics because it is not safe for people to be out across much of Texas. Vaccination will resume as soon as conditions permit,” Van Deusen said. “I haven't heard of any public sites being open, but I guess there could be some isolated places where that's possible.”Reasons for closure ranged from lack of supply to utility issues, according to state and local health officials. That includes 85 large vaccination hubs and several hundred smaller providers across the state.One potential threat to supply already in Texas is the inability of the power grid to keep up with demand, which has resulted in rolling blackouts and outages across the state. Health officials have not reported any doses wasted so far, but those numbers will continue to come in throughout the week and offer “a clearer picture of the effects on vaccine storage in the coming days,” Van Deusen said.Hospitals and health departments “generally have backup power,” but small providers may not, Van Deusen said.“If they can’t store vaccine under the appropriate conditions, we’re asking them to transfer or administer it,” he said.The Pfizer vaccine can be stored under regular refrigeration (up to 47 degrees F) for up to five days before it needs ultra-cold storage; Moderna for 30 days.When the power went out at a Harris County facility storing 8,500 vaccines early Monday, officials sent most doses to local hospitals, universities, a local jail, and other facilities capable of storing and administering them to keep them from being wasted, said Rafael Lemaitre, spokesperson for County Judge Lina Hidalgo.The doses not allocated to the other facilities were put back into storage after manufacturers told them they could be saved, he said.“Nothing was wasted, nothing was thrown away,” he said.Most of the doses were administered Monday morning at the various sites, according to a report in the Houston Chronicle.Lemaitre said local hospitals are on the critical circuits run by CenterPoint Energy in Harris County and are safeguarded against rolling blackouts. They also have backup generators in the event of a weather-induced outage.“They know where the critical infrastructure is,” he said. “We have not heard any other indications that there is a threat of spoilage or a lack of refrigeration anywhere else. But we’re still in this, we’re expecting more severe weather tonight, so we’re monitoring it closely.”The Texas Tribune is a nonpartisan, nonprofit media organization that informs Texans—and engages with them—about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The shots not only will help protect the nation\'s elderly and infirm -- and the staff who care for them -- but they raise the prospect of ending the devastating isolation many residents have felt for months.Family members are hopeful that before too long, they will return to visiting parents and grandparents, aunts, uncles and other loved ones regularly again. We checked with experts on some common questions.Will restrictions on visiting be lifted soon?Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesProbably not in a big way. Restrictions vary by state, and the federal government\'s guidance on what it considers safe stands for now. They already allow visits under certain conditions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, recommended in September that outdoor visits with residents be allowed and indoor visits, too, if the facility has been free of cases for 14 days.Some medical experts have said that those guidelines are too lax and that visits should be severely restricted, even banned. However, some of these experts are now saying that the vaccine changes the equation, somewhat."Once all residents are vaccinated, it opens the door for loosening of restrictions," said Dr. Michael Wasserman, the immediate past president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine, a geriatrician and former executive at nursing home chains.To allow visits, Wasserman recommends all residents of a nursing home should be vaccinated (unless they have some condition or allergy that would discourage vaccination on medical grounds); all staff members should be vaccinated; the nursing home should have the ability to ensure that visitors test negative for the coronavirus and have been disciplined about wearing a mask in public settings.Is the vaccine safe and effective for old and frail residents of nursing homes?The clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine included people over 65, and results showed it to be safe and to work as well in older people as in younger ones."This vaccine has gone through testing and clinical trials to ensure it meets the highest safety standards. It also is safe to get if you already had the virus," says a campaign to encourage people to get the shots by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, a combined trade group representing nursing homes and assisted-living communities.The lead administrator for CMS, Seema Verma, reinforced the confidence in the shot for older patients, including those with health conditions, in a statement last week: "I urge states to prioritize nursing homes and vulnerable seniors in their distribution of the vaccine."The point is echoed by Dr. Sabine von Preyss-Friedman, chief medical officer of Avalon Health Care Group, which operates nursing homes, who said the new vaccines appear "safe and effective."If restrictions are eased, should I visit right away?The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both require two injections -- the initial shot and a booster three or four weeks later. Von Preyss-Friedman recommends waiting at least two weeks after the second shot to have a visit."You hope these vaccines work, but these are elderly patients," she said. "You want to err on the side of protection."She said that, ideally, the visitor would also be vaccinated as well. Since shots won\'t be widely available for a few months, it may be best to wait until you get your vaccine. Until then, she believes nursing homes should consider visits on a case-by-case basis.Would visitors still need to wear a mask?Absolutely, medical experts said. This is particularly true if they are not vaccinated, but even after they are vaccinated "until rates in the community go down," said Dr. Joshua Uy, a geriatrician and associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School and the medical director of Renaissance Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center, a nursing home in Philadelphia.Uy said that he hopes that the federal government would supply enough personal protective equipment so that all visitors and residents could be properly gowned for such visits.What is being done to encourage nursing home residents to get vaccinated?The combined nursing-home and assisted-living trade group has started a program aimed at helping nursing homes and other care facilities to explain to residents the essential need to get the vaccine. The campaign, getvaccinated, notes: "The elderly population has a much higher risk for getting very sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19. The vaccine has been shown to provide a great deal of protection against serious illness due to COVID-19."But the people they love most may have more effective persuasive powers. Families can help, Uy said, by encouraging their parents and grandparents in nursing homes to get vaccinated."The vaccine," he said, "is going to be our way out."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'ee52157a921242ab7fd93ea194363bcd', 'title': 'Trump Would Rather You Die Than Aid Biden’s Vaccine Rollout', 'description': 'Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/ Photos GettyThe White House just launched a $250 million ad campaign to convince the vaccine-hesitant to get inoculated. President Joe Biden could save himself the money and call on political influencers to do it for him. Just up the street sit members of Congress—about 25 percent of them, mostly Republicans—who haven’t gotten it yet.If our elected leaders can’t lead us to herd immunity, who can? Each member, under continuity of government rules, is entitled to the shot. No waiting on hold for an appointment, no traveling far afield to get it, no lines. The doctor, in the form of an Attending Physician, is literally in the House.As the rollout continues, it’s not minorities rejecting the vaccine, even though they have reason to doubt their government’s intentions toward them and have the most trouble nailing one. It’s white Republicans who are resisting—like former President Donald Trump, who treated COVID as something between a hoax and a personal affront. Hydroxychloroquine, or bleach? Maybe. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine? Hell no. Sen. Ron “Anon” Johnson said having COVID-19 is superior to the vaccine against it.Last week, a Monmouth University poll found that 56 percent of Republicans will likely never get the vaccine or want to wait and see. For how long, they don’t say. NPR/PBS/Marist found that 47 percent of Trump voters, one in two Republican men, and 41 percent of Republicans will not get the vaccine. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that Republicans continue to refuse to get the vaccine at double the rate of any other group.Stephen Colbert Mocks Trump’s ‘Unbelievably Sad’ Vaccine StatementNone of this is surprising except that Trump’s followers are willing to die for him. It’s a free country, Republicans are fond of saying, and it’s their private choice to refuse a vaccine, as was their crowding on to the White House lawn for their superspreader convention and the celebration of the confirmation of a new Supreme Court justice. But their choices end where our public health begins. Herd immunity that will spring us from our houses and ignite the economy will take as much as 85 per cent of the population getting vaccinated. Wouldn’t red America like to go to an anxiety-free barbecue on the 4th of July? I know the answer. They’ll be popping a Bud and grilling a burger no matter what.Which brings us to Republican governors. A new survey by Johns Hopkins found that starting in early summer last year, states with Republican governors had more cases and higher death rates than those led by Democrats. With two notable exceptions—Maryland’s Larry Hogan and Massachusetts’ Charlie Baker—governors embraced Trump’s attitude of take two aspirin and call me in the morning rather than risk his wrath. “What, me worry about a little old flu?” is such a political signifier that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is a likely presidential candidate running on a record of welcoming bikers to rally in her state and allowing meatpacking plants to become death traps. Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott, undeterred by having to park COVID patients in garages and dead bodies in ice trucks, reopened precipitately again this month—adding for sport a no-mask mandate. If Trump’s arch-enemy Dr. Tony Fauci says don’t spike the ball too soon or all our sacrifices will be in vain, count on hundreds of GOP officials to deflate the ball and pound it into the ground.There are other reasons for vaccine-resistance—the usual anti-vaxxers, concern over the speed with which the vaccines were developed, and the CDC telling us what the vaccine doesn’t mean we can do. Not to be released into the wild to party like it’s 2019 is a downer to be sure. But nothing is more determinative of whether you will or won’t get the vaccine than political persuasion.And so Biden has to spend money to sell a group of people on doing what’s good for them to make up for Republicans who won’t. If only he had his predecessor and social influencer from Mar-a-Lago to help him in the Republican States of America. Instead, rather than appear in a public service ad getting a shot as other former presidents did, Trump got his in secret. The guess that he did it to preserve the illusion that he has the arms of a buff 70-year old is ridiculous. Have you seen him in golf regalia?In his first major address, President Biden spoke as doctor-in-chief. He promised all those who want the vaccine will be eligible for it as of May 1 and that relief to those who suffered most economically was on the way. But more importantly, like presidents past, Ronald Reagan after the Challenger exploded and George Bush atop the rubble at Ground Zero, he assured us that there is life after loss and joy after grief. If we let go of our usual divisions and each sacrifice for the whole, we can survive together.If only, the man in Mar-a-Lago must be thinking, as he hears tell of the man whose name he won’t say. Trump’s approval rating near the end of his term was 34 percent, and his 41 percent average approval rating across his term the lowest any president has sunk, according to Gallup. The man now sitting at his desk and sleeping in his bedroom (sanitized for COVID reasons) is well above 5o percent and his relief bill above 60. On the back of his daily schedule is the number of dead from COVID, although he needs no reminder.The mistakes that haunt us are the unforced ones. Trump could have marshalled the government to conquer the virus instead of denying it, as if it were some great unfairness that had befallen him. Biden spoke of the personal and collective loss we’ve suffered but also how “finding the light in the darkness is a very American thing to do.” It’s no wonder Trump took the vaccine in the dark. The one choice Trump never considered making was to do the right thing. At night, in the quiet, Trump knows that. It’s why Biden’s president and he isn’t.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': '7d8fe05a785ff6e728ef92952f4ca002', 'title': 'Plenty of Vaccines, but Not Enough Arms: A Warning Sign in Cherokee Nation', 'description': 'TAHLEQUAH, Okla. — As people across the United States jockey and wait to get vaccinated, a surprising problem is unfolding in the Cherokee Nation: plenty of shots, but not enough arms. “We’re running out of people to vaccinate,” said Brian Hail, who helps oversee the tribe’s vaccination efforts. He winced as he pulled up the day’s schedule one recent morning: Vaccinations were open to basically everyone across the reservation, but 823 appointments sat unclaimed. It is a side effect of early success, tribal health officials said. With many enthusiastic patients inoculated and new coronavirus infections at an ebb, the urgency for vaccines has gone distressingly quiet. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Now, the tribe is confronting what looms as a major hurdle for the entire country as vaccine supplies swell to meet demand: how to vaccinate everyone not eagerly lined up for a shot. It is a dizzying public health challenge that cuts across the country. It encompasses persuading skeptics, calling people who do not realize they are now eligible, and making vaccines accessible for homebound patients, overstretched working families and people in rural areas and minority communities. The Cherokee Nation has administered more than 33,000 doses at nine vaccination sites across its reservation, which spreads from cities through rural woodlands, cattle pastures and poultry farms in northeastern Oklahoma. After vaccinating health care workers, Cherokee-speaking elders and essential workers, the tribe opened appointments to anyone who qualifies, tribal member or not, living in its borders. Still, hundreds of slots have gone unfilled, health officials said. Cherokee-speaking vaccine schedulers hired to set up appointments are waiting for their phones to ring. “Those initial waves of people that really wanted and needed the vaccine — we worked through that,” said Hail, deputy executive director of external operations at Cherokee Nation Health Services. The tribe counts 141,000 citizens on the reservation and 380,000 worldwide. “We’re struggling to get people to come in.” Dennis Chewey, 60, gave his brother and sister the tribe’s vaccination hotline and urged them to call. Chewey’s wife was at high risk because of her job as a casino housekeeper, and he knew several people who had died, including a health worker who had helped him treat his diabetes. But none of them had called. “They’re leery of taking it,” Chewey said, a few minutes after he and his wife, Clara, got their second dose at the tribe’s gleaming new outpatient clinic. “They’re my family. I can’t make anybody do anything.” Public health teams across the country are refocusing their energy and resources on bringing vaccinations to people. They are plunging into New York neighborhoods to reach homebound people, and visiting rural communities where unreliable internet makes it difficult to sign up for appointments or log into vaccination websites. They are driving long dirt roads to reach families without the cars or gas money to visit vaccination clinics. The Navajo Nation, which says it has vaccinated roughly 70% of its citizens, sent public health workers into rural corners of the high desert to vaccinate as many as 5,000 people close to their homes. The Cherokee Nation is planning “strike teams” of nurses with single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The Osage Nation, in northeastern Oklahoma, is vaccinating about 200 people a day at a clinic that has the capacity to give 500 shots. It tried two mass vaccination events at its casinos, but the results were disappointing. So the tribe bought two 30-foot “medical RVs” that will roll into smaller towns like Hominy and Fairfax to reach the 30% to 40% of tribal elders and essential workers who did not volunteer to get vaccinated. It is a house-by-house campaign against misinformation and wariness, waged with long conversations and patience. “You kind of grind it out,” said Dr. Ronald Shaw, medical director of the 23,000-member Osage Nation. “We tried to remove every obstacle to people who were sitting on the fence.” The coronavirus has been particularly devastating for Indigenous communities. It has killed American Indians and Alaska Natives at nearly twice the rate of white people, and inflicted a cultural crisis by killing the elders who pass down language and traditional teachings. The economic toll of the pandemic has pummeled native economies already racked by high poverty and unemployment. The vaccine rollout in native communities has been a surprising source of strength, especially as vaccinations of other communities, such as Black and Hispanic Americans, continue to lag behind white populations. Working through the Indian Health Service and long-established networks of tribally run clinics, tribes are outpacing much of the country, already giving shots to healthy adults and eligible teenagers. Some have even thrown open the doors to nontribal members inside their borders. In all, about 1.1 million vaccines have been distributed through the Indian Health Service and 670,000 have been administered. Still, health care advocates said frustrating gaps remained. Many Indigenous people in big cities and areas without tribal health centers had struggled to find vaccines. Now, native health workers are desperately hoping to get through to people like Nora Birdtail, 64, one of a shrinking number of Cherokee-speaking elders. Their names are marked down in a leather notebook that was created to inscribe their importance to Cherokee heritage and culture. Today, the notebook is a register of loss — of at least 35 lives and numberless stories cut short by the virus. Even as hundreds of elders got vaccinated, Birdtail resisted. She is vulnerable to the coronavirus from a stroke. Her job as a teacher’s aide brings her into close contact with children at the Cherokee Immersion School, where in-person classes are expected to resume soon. But Birdtail is scared of getting vaccinated, largely because she once passed out after getting a penicillin shot years ago. The government’s legacy of medical malpractice in Indian Country — a history of coercive treatments, shoddy care, forced sterilizations and more — has also instilled a deep skepticism about taking a government-supported vaccine. “It made me think back to the Trail of Tears, how they all got sick,” Birdtail said. “I don’t trust it.” The number of Americans willing to get vaccinated has grown as people watch family and friends, politicians and Dolly Parton roll up their sleeves. But about 18% of American adults said they would probably not or definitely not get vaccinated, according to a recent survey by the Census Bureau. Nationwide, people’s embrace of the vaccine has split sharply on partisan lines, with a third of Republicans saying they would not take the vaccine and another 20% saying they were unsure, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll. Ten percent of Democrats said they would not take the vaccine. Across Cherokee Nation, people who jumped to get vaccinated said they wanted to protect themselves and, more important, safeguard their community, elders and children who are still not eligible to get shots. Those who hesitated said they still had too many questions — about the vaccines’ efficacy, side effects and the speed they made it to market. The three vaccines that have received emergency authorization in the United States have been shown to greatly reduce serious illnesses and deaths from the virus, and all went through layers of review by the government and outside scientists. But those assurances had yet to reach a trailer in the community of Dry Creek where Fred Walker, 65, has to haul his drinking water from a neighbor’s home. Walker is disabled and worries about the virus. But he has avoided the vaccine because he fears it could damage his health. He said no health workers had reached out to schedule an appointment or answer his questions. “Nobody’s said anything about it,” he said. Others just seemed to want a nudge. At a Walmart providing shots, unvaccinated shoppers said they were not so much opposed as just waiting. For more information. For a doctor’s recommendation. For more people to take it. Even in places where vaccine appointments abound, some people worry about stealing a spot. Shelldon Miggletto, a Cherokee citizen and economic development director for the 4,000-person town of Stilwell (“Strawberry Capital of the World”), has held off because he does not want to cut in front of someone with asthma or diabetes. Similar issues have cropped up in Alaska, where vaccine slots went unfilled because people did not realize they were eligible. The nurses who run the Cherokee Nation’s vaccination program are obsessed with how to reel in more people. They are planning to vaccinate eligible students at Sequoyah High School. There is talk of vaccinations at barbecues, and T-shirts for the newly vaccinated. The health service has called and sent out mass texts asking unvaccinated members whether they are willing to come in. One of those messages found Sherry Garrett, 68. She and her husband had harbored deep suspicions about the vaccine and had planned to refuse it. But then her sister died in July after what her family believes was an undiagnosed case of COVID-19 months earlier. Someone at Walmart coughed in Garrett’s face. And when a Cherokee health worker called to offer a slot, Garrett said she relented, and convinced her husband, Larry, to come along. As they sat in a half-empty monitoring area, waiting the requisite 15 minutes after Larry’s first dose, Garrett said she now saw getting the shot as part of who she was: “I’m Cherokee, so I have to do it.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

AP Photo/J. Scott ApplewhiteReconciliation – it’s a term federal budget experts would understand, but for the rest of us, it sounds like what you do with a family member you haven’t talked to in years. It’s also the process congressional Democrats plan to use to pass President Joe Biden’s US$1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue and stimulus bill in the Senate. We asked Raymond Scheppach, who is a public policy scholar at the University of Virginia and a former deputy director at the Congressional Budget Office, to describe reconciliation and explain why its use now is causing such controversy. What is reconciliation, and how is it used in Congress? Reconciliation is a legislative process originally intended to reduce federal budget deficits. In 1974, lawmakers decided they had to deal with a recurring problem: If more money was spent than expected or revenues didn’t meet projections, the nation’s deficit grew. But lowering deficits is politically difficult; to do it, Congress needed to either increase revenues, cut spending or both. That usually meant reducing entitlements and other mandatory spending – like nutrition assistance for children – or increasing taxes. So legislators created this process called “reconciliation” that could be used to reconcile actual spending with Congress’ previously adopted spending targets. Here’s the key part that addressed the problems legislators faced when cutting spending or hiking taxes: Budget moves made under reconciliation could not be filibustered. Lawmakers believed this could ease the political difficulty associated with lowering deficits over the long term. An important point: Reconciliation could be used only to change taxes, mandatory spending like farm price supports and entitlements such as Social Security or Medicare. President Joe Biden holds a meeting with business leaders about his COVID-19 bill in the Oval Office of the White House, Feb. 9, 2021. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Does using reconciliation for the COVID-19 bill represent a hijacking of the original purpose of the process? It’s important to look back at the 1974 Act to determine the purpose of the reconciliation provision and how it has changed over time. A provision that was created in 1974 to reduce deficits is now being used to do the opposite: dramatically increase deficits. So contrary to reconciliation’s original purpose, it was used for the 2001, 2003 and 2017 tax cuts, which substantially increased deficits. Congress could do that because the restrictions on reconciliation’s use in the Senate have been reduced over time so that now major tax cuts or omnibus spending bills are allowed. It was also inappropriately used to pass modifications to the Affordable Care Act, which significantly increased spending even though it also raised revenues sufficient to offset the spending. Even though it was budget-neutral, it did not reduce the deficit. The $1.9 billion Biden COVID-19 bill would also be an inappropriate use relative to the original intent of the provision, as it would substantially increase the deficit. In 2001, the GOP used reconciliation to push George W. Bush’s tax cuts through Congress. Here, on June 7 of that year, Bush leans over after he dropped a pen as he signed his $1.35 trillion tax cut bill at the White House. AP Photo/Ron Edmonds How often has reconciliation been used? The reconciliation provision has been used by both parties more than 21 times since the 1980s. In some cases, such as the 1990 and 1993 Omnibus Reconciliation Acts, whose major purpose was to cut spending and increase revenues, each reduced the deficit by a little over $700 billion over five years. For President Biden and the Democrats on Capitol Hill, there are some clear advantages in using the reconciliation process. It would make consideration of the $1.9 trillion bill privileged, in legislative terms. This means that debate can be limited, but most importantly it can’t be filibustered in the Senate, as it requires only 51 rather than 60 votes to pass. As long as all 50 Democrats are willing to vote in favor, then the vice president, also a Democrat, can cast the deciding 51st vote. This process is much more important in the Senate as opposed to the House of Representatives, which has a rules committee that can limit debate and amendments. One fact sheet about reconciliation, produced by the House budget committee in 2020, says “Reconciliation is a tool – a special process – that makes legislation easier to pass in the Senate.” Are there other reasons legislators would want to use reconciliation? Because it requires only a simple majority vote, legislation can be passed relatively quickly under reconciliation’s rules rather than going through a time-consuming negotiation to come up with a bipartisan bill. Since most of the money in President Biden’s bill is for coping with COVID-19 and stabilizing a damaged economy, the administration believes timing is critical. The faster the bill can be enacted, the faster schools can fully reopen, vaccines can be administered and the unemployed will be able to find jobs. Is the COVID-19 stimulus bill the one time we’re likely to see reconciliation used this year? Under the rules, most years there can only be one reconciliation bill. But because it wasn’t used last year, Biden and the Democrats will be able to do two this year. This means that they would be able to use reconciliation for this $1.9 trillion COVID-19 bill and then another reconciliation bill later in the year on climate change or infrastructure or any other major priority. There is no sacrificing other major Democratic priorities if reconciliation is used at this time, which is another political advantage – although using reconciliation to pass these policies would again violate the original intent of the process. Is using reconciliation – devised to avoid political battles – now another form of power politics, ramming legislation through rather than considering the minority’s views? The Senate often operates on historical precedents, and thus the longer-term questions are: What is the effect of using reconciliation on the Senate as an institution? How does it affect the rights of the minority and even democracy itself? Perhaps the most significant negative effect is that it has reduced the rights of the minority party to shape legislation, which often leads to more extreme policies. Participation by the minority party in making legislation often forces policy toward the middle of the political spectrum, where most Americans live. But what we are seeing more often now is that the minority party refuses to engage with the majority party on legislation. That can force the majority to go the route of reconciliation. Yet passing legislation through reconciliation, I believe, exacerbates voter frustration and weakens democracy.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

{'_id': 'cec8f4796e0d7c9ddd5314122df62de6', 'title': 'Japan Extends Virus Emergency by a Month for Tokyo, Other Cities', 'description': '(Bloomberg) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga extended a state of emergency covering Tokyo and other major metropolitan areas to March 7, seeking to control Covid-19 after infections hit record highs in January.Suga on Tuesday added another month to the measure due to expire on Feb. 7, after saying that while infections have come down, the numbers were still a concern.The current emergency measure has been in effect since early January for 11 areas, including Tokyo and Osaka, that account for about 60% of the economy’s total output. It calls for residents to avoid going out after 8:00 p.m., while bars and restaurants have been asked to voluntarily close at that time.The extension was for 10 of the 11 original areas with the prefecture of Tochigi, north of Tokyo, being taken off the list after it saw a sharp drop in infections.“Since we declared the emergency, the number of new infections in Tokyo and across the country is trending down, so we can say that the measures have had a clear effect,” Suga said. “We need to continue this downward trend and reduce the numbers in hospitals and in serious condition.”The measure could be lifted before March 7 in areas that achieve sufficient improvement, he added. Suga also announced that the rollout of vaccines in Japan would be brought forward slightly to mid-February from the end of the month, with medical personnel receiving the initial doses. He added while Japan has been quick to secure vaccines, it has been slow to start inoculations.Suga has been trying to seek a balance of propping up a virus-battered economy and clamping down on infections, especially ahead of Tokyo hosting the Olympics from July -- but the extension puts new pressure on finances. The two-month emergency is likely to slice around 3 trillion yen ($28.6 billion) off gross domestic product, according to Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute.As of Jan. 29, economists expected GDP to shrink by an annualized 2.5% this quarter, having previously forecast an expansion, though some analysts see a much bigger hit. Economists at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. now see a stronger finish to 2020 morphing into an 11.5% contraction in the three months through March.JAPAN REACT: Longer Virus Emergency Better Than Ending EmergencyThe extension comes as Suga tries to reverse a slide in support among a public critical of his virus policies ahead of an election that must be held by October. When it comes having spectators at the Tokyo Olympics, Suga didn’t give a definitive answer, saying he will be keeping safety in mind while watching the local and international situation.Japan’s lower house of parliament passed two bills Monday imposing penalties on those who fail to obey official coronavirus management orders, adding teeth to the current voluntary guidelines. The legislation was expected to gain final approval later this week in the upper house, which is also controlled by Suga’s ruling coalition.Under the revised special measures act, businesses can be fined up to 300,000 yen ($2,870) if they don’t comply with official orders to shorten their operating hours. A separate act on controlling infectious diseases would allow fines of as much as 500,000 yen on those with Covid-19 who refuse to be hospitalized.It was unclear when the new legislation will come into effect.The government is seeking to bring infections down to stage 3 of four levels before lifting the emergency. That would mean numbers in Tokyo need to fall below 500 per day and 300 per day in Osaka, and the strain on hospitals must ease.Tokyo reported 556 new infections on Tuesday, well below the city’s daily record of 2,447 on Jan. 7. However, the number of patients in hospitals has changed little since the emergency was declared.The country has posted by far the fewest confirmed Covid-19 cases of any Group of Seven country, recording a lower number of cases in all of 2020 than the U.S. tallied on certain days in January.Japan has yet to see the explosive surges that devastated medical systems in the U.S. and European countries. But with the developed world’s oldest population, Japan sits on a tinderbox -- nearly a third of its residents are 65 or older, and therefore more vulnerable to the virus.“The tough medicine should lead to a stronger growth outcome further ahead -- if it succeeds in reducing cases and avoiding even stronger measures later,” wrote Bloomberg Economics’ Yuki Masujima.(Updates with comments from Suga at news conference.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Seven hours later, the United States reported more than 4,409 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, according to data collected by the COVID-19 Tracking Project.The Biden administration came into power with purpose and an extensive agenda to combat the coronavirus pandemic, but purpose and planning only gets you so far—particularly when the president’s team is only just now getting a clear picture of how badly the previous administration had managed the crisis.“What we’re inheriting from the Trump administration is so much worse than we could have imagined,” Jeff Zients, the Biden administration’s COVID-19 czar, said in a call with reporters Wednesday. “We don't have the visibility that we would hope to have into supply and allocations.”“I think we have to level-set expectations,” added Tom Frieden, the former director for the Centers for Disease Control in the Obama administration. “There are lots of things that an incoming administration can do on Day One, including speaking honestly about the pandemic.”The new administration is already behind, in part because the Trump administration was unprecedentedly hostile during the transition. The question now, however, is how Biden can get a handle on a raging pandemic when his team is already so far behind.The task at hand is enormous. More than 400,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. Every state, territory and the District of Columbia is in a state of emergency. The number of people infected with the virus who are now hospitalized is more than double the number reached during the spring and summer peaks.It’s not just the spread of the virus that the Biden team needs to tackle. Officials will also have to confront the disinformation and misinformation about the virus that has permeated all four corners of the country—where people still believe the virus is a hoax and that public health guidelines are too great of an imposition on their personal freedom to follow. But it’s unclear what power of persuasion the Biden administration will hold and if it will be enough to convince people to take the virus more seriously.“At least we won’t have a president that’s actively fighting those rules on national television,” one official working with the new Biden COVID-19 team said. 1297494723 U.S. President Joe Biden prepares to sign a series of executive orders at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office just hours after his inauguration on January 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. Biden became the 46th president of the United States earlier today during the ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Chip Somodevilla/Getty More urgently, Biden and his team will have to handle the growing frustration among states over the lack of a comprehensive vaccine-distribution program that enables them to inoculate their residents quickly. They will have to find a way to get states more vaccines needed to meet Americans’ growing demand for the shot.Biden’s COVID-19 team says the president will use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to ensure that health-care facilities have what they need for personal protective equipment and to continue to scale testing across the country. Officials say Biden will also use the act and “other legal authorities” for “raw materials to ensure that bottlenecks do not slow down [vaccine] production,” Zients said, specifically mentioned the production of syringes as critical to success.It’s still unclear exactly when the president will invoke the DPA, and if the administration will lean on the legal authority for the production of supplies other than vaccine syringes.“Making vaccines is not simple, and you can't cut any corners,” Frieden said. “We'll see if there's anything more that can be done.”Biden enters office as states across the country are grappling with massive vaccine shortages. Hospitals and pharmacies have begun to run out, forcing them to cancel first and second dose appointments. Officials in states such as California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New York, New Jersey, and Arizona this week called on the federal government to not only help facilitate the shipment of additional vaccines but to clearly communicate how many doses they should expect to receive in the coming days. They’ve received no answers, according to six state health officials, all of whom requested to remain anonymous to speak more freely about the issue.CDC Officials Urge Biden Team to Dump Palantir’s COVID Tracker Her State’s in a COVID Death Spiral. Biden Just Hired Her.Those officials said the Biden team has for weeks reached out to states to assuage their concerns about the lack of a cohesive and functioning vaccination distribution system. The Biden message to frustrated governors was simple: help is on the way. But as White House officials begin to strategize on how best to remedy the situation they are finding that the foundation on which the Trump administration built its vaccine distribution program is more flawed than previously understood, according to two individuals involved with vaccine planning. From the accounting to the way vaccines are allocated and scheduled for delivery—the system doesn’t allow for the quick movement of vaccines off the manufacturing line to state vaccine distribution points, those officials said. 1230601329 Health workers wait for patients to administer Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines at the opening of a new vaccination site at Corsi Houses in Harlem New York on January 15, 2021. - Pfizer expects lower coronavirus vaccine deliveries for a stretch beginning in late January in order to lift output later this winter and throughout 2021, the drugmaker said January 15. KENA BETANCUR/Getty The former Trump administration built out the vaccine distribution process within the confines of Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to fast-track a novel COVID-19 vaccine. In the first few months of its existence, Operation Warp Speed focused on development—creating the country’s first effective mRNA vaccine and supporting companies’ clinical trials. The distribution strategizing came later. Developed by the military, the plan was to have the federal government, specifically the military officials within Operation Warp Speed, lead the logistics part of the vaccine delivery. The military would not actually touch the vaccine but would instead coordinate the effort from the Pentagon.Part of that coordination required states using the Pentagon’s Tiberius system—a platform that allows local officials to input their orders and see when they will be receiving their next doses. States only had a few weeks to try out the Tiberius platform before the vaccine rollout began in December, officials said, and they were provided false projections on how many doses they would be receiving once the Pfizer vaccine became available.Two state health officials who spoke to The Daily Beast said they believe the Tiberius system is still not accurately updating and is miscounting either how many doses the companies have manufactured or how many have been allocated by the federal government. Those officials said they have yet to receive responses from federal officials about whether their most recent orders for Pfizer and Moderna jabs have been filled.Part of the confusion among states is how the newest Trump administration federal guidelines on vaccine distribution have impacted the manufacturing process. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with the Centers for Disease Control, recently released a new set of recommendations that allow states to hand out the vaccine more freely—to widen the population of who can receive the shot in the first wave. The federal government also said it would start to release doses it had originally held in reserve for second-shot dosing.The recommendations almost worked too well—they ramped up demand significantly. Now, states say they don’t have enough doses.“There were more than 12 million hits to a map of providers we posted yesterday so it is clear that many Pennsylvanians are eager to get the COVID-19 vaccine,” a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health. “Unfortunately, we do not have enough vaccine for everyone who wants it right now.”The policy centerpiece of Biden’s attempt to turn the tide on the pandemic—and the devastating economic consequences it has also wrought—is a $1.9 trillion relief package he rolled out a week ago. It calls not only for expanded unemployment help, small business aid, and $1,400 direct checks, but $350 billion in relief aid to state and local governments to boost testing and vaccine rollout, and $20 billion and $50 billion for separate vaccine and testing initiatives, respectively.But that proposal faces an uncertain environment on Capitol Hill—particularly the Senate, where Democrats now hold the tie-breaking vote and where an impeachment trial of Trump is expected to eat up at least a week of the upcoming legislative calendar. The president’s allies fear that the trial, combined with Biden’s urgent push to confirm members of the cabinet who will help enact his efforts to control the virus, could push passage of his trillion-dollar “rescue plan“ into late spring.Democratic senators, who largely agree with Biden’s assessment that their $900 billion December relief bill was merely a “down payment” for a more expansive follow-up, are anxious to see the Senate leap into action at a pivotal moment in the country’s struggle to control the virus.“It’s the top priority,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA). “My gut tells me we will do all we can to find a bipartisan accord on it. There are many pieces of the proposed package I think that will generate significant Republican support.”Biden’s transition has actively reached out to lawmakers in both parties to sell them on their plan; Kaine told The Daily Beast that the process will “really accelerate” now that Biden has been sworn in.With GOP support a must to reach the 60-vote threshold—otherwise, the legislation will be stripped down only to issues relating to government spending and revenues—the administration is making a point of courting Republicans inclined to support such a proposal. One of them, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), said as she left the inaugural ceremony on Wednesday that she had already gotten the Biden team’s pitch and a chance to directly ask them questions.“I got a pretty good walkthrough of their COVID proposal yesterday,” Murkowski told The Daily Beast. “It's going to require, I think, a fair amount of debate and consideration. But he's made it clear that this is his initial priority. I don't disagree with that. We've got an economy that's really been hurt, we've got a vaccine that needs to get distributed—we’ve got a lot of work to do.”A key Democratic vote, centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), told reporters on Wednesday that a bipartisan group of senators—the same cohort that pushed the last round of COVID relief out of a stalemate last year—is slated to meet with White House officials this weekend to talk about the economic side of their plan. 1230689861 Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. During today's inauguration ceremony Joe Biden becomes the 46th president of the United States. JONATHAN ERNST/Getty Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters he hoped that group could produce a counter-proposal, rejecting some parts of Biden’s plan—such as its raising of the federal minimum wage—out of hand.“There’s space for a deal,” he said.The willingness of senior Republicans to even contemplate a deal puts wind at Biden’s back—and justifies the prayer, invoked in his inaugural address, that a nation united in common purpose may be able to turn the tide against the virus.“We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation,” Biden said. “And I promise you this, as the Bible says: ‘Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.’ We will get through this together. Together.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Both vaccines produced lower levels of coronavirus antibodies than have been found in the blood of individuals who recovered from natural COVID-19 infections. For reference, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines produced antibody levels several times higher than natural infections.The unsuccessful trials are disappointing in large part because both Merck vaccines would have required just one dose, writes Stat. One of the candidates, which uses the same virus as the one in Merck's successful Ebola vaccine, was being developed in partnership with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which has said it will try to determine if using an oral or intranasal administration route will work better than the current intramuscular injection. It's unclear if Merck will continue to collaborate — IAVI's president Mark Feinberg told Stat he hopes they do — because the pharmaceutical company has suggested it will now turn its focus to developing COVID-19 therapeutics.As Stat notes, the results show just how difficult vaccine development can be, especially in such a short amount of time, making the rapid success of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots seem all the more remarkable.

He advises a universal wearing of masks, maintaining physical distance, avoiding congregate settings or crowds, doing more outdoors, as opposed to indoors and washing hands frequently. Those are the most important things you can do. But when asked—in an interview with the USA TODAY Editorial Board—he tinged his answer with a bit of cheerleading. Read on to hear more, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.\xa0Dr. Fauci Said the #1 Most Important Thing You Can Do Is This"What\'s the most important thing for people to do between now and when the cavalry arrives?" he was asked. The calvary referenced is the coronavirus vaccine, two of which—from Pfizer and Moderna—have been shown to be 95% effective in trials."The cavalry is on its way," answered Fauci. "It\'s not here yet, but it\'s going to come. We have an even better than expected efficacy signal on two vaccines. We\'re likely to already start having distribution of doses, hopefully by the end of December but certainly no later than at the beginning of January. If we can hang on and implement the public health measures, help is really on the way.""What about COVID fatigue and denialism?" asked the Board."Even in some of the states where they\'re getting really hit badly, we\'re hearing people even denying there\'s a problem as their hospitals are getting filled," he said.\xa0For example, as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to soar across the country, no region better exemplifies the trouble at hand than the Dakotas. North Dakota has the world\'s highest mortality rate and its governor has only recently implemented new prevention measures, after receiving flak for telling COVID-positive health workers to keep working while ill. Meanwhile, South Dakota\'s governor, Kristi Noem, has taken the national stage to rail against restrictions of any kind, saying the responsibility for public health was on her constituents, not their government. Her state is struggling with the nation\'s highest positivity rate, with 1,000 cases a day.Jodi Doering is an emergency room nurse in South Dakota and lives in a small town. She posted a viral tweet about how her patients deny they\'re dying of COVID right before they die of COVID. "I think the hardest thing to watch is that people are still looking for something else and they want a magic answer and they don\'t want to believe that COVID is real," Doering told CNN\'s New Day. "And the reason I tweeted what I did is it wasn\'t one particular patient. It\'s just a culmination of so many people and their last dying words are, um, this can\'t be happening. It\'s not real. And when they should be spending time FaceTiming their families, they\'re filled with anger and hatred. And it just made me really sad the other night. And, um, I just can\'t believe that those are going to be their last thoughts and words."Says Fauci of the denial: "I think that\'s a spillover of a combination of fatigue for people who are trying (to stay safe) and denial for people who always think that everything is fake news. It really becomes an unprecedented public health challenge."RELATED: Dr. Fauci Says Most People Did This Before Catching COVIDHow to Survive the PandemicNo matter where you live, do everything you can to prevent getting—and spreading—COVID-19 in the first place, and "hang on" until there\'s a vaccine available: Wear your face mask, get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, stay outdoors more than indoors, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don\'t miss these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

"It\'s going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud," Mr Trump said, refusing to say whether he would attend Mr Biden\'s inauguration in January. In the nearest he has come to a concession, Mr Trump said he would leave the White House if Mr Biden is certified the election winner by the Electoral College - the process by which presidents are elected - on December 14. However, Mr Trump appeared to suggest he still held hopes of retaining the presidency. Asked about his plans for his last Thanksgiving in the White House, the president told reporters that the occasion might be the “first one of a second term”. The president added there were "a lot of things happening between now and January 20th [inauguration day]" and the election results have a "long way" to go. "I know one thing Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes," he said. "The only way he got 80 million votes is through massive fraud." During his annual Thanksgiving call with US troops overseas, Mr Trump also claimed the US will begin delivering Covid-19 vaccines "next week and the week after" as he insisted the country had "rounded the curve" on the pandemic. "We are rounding the curve [on the virus]. The vaccines are being delivered - literally it will start next week and the week after," he said during his address. Mr Trump suggested that medical workers, other frontline staff and elderly people would be the first to receive the vaccinations. It is unclear which vaccine Mr Trump was referencing, or whether he was referring to a specific federal government policy for a vaccine distribution. Two US companies, Moderna and Pfizer, have so far announced that their vaccines are effective at protecting people against coronavirus. Earlier this week US government officials said the administration planned to distribute around 6.4 million doses of Pfizer\'s vaccine to Americans as soon as the jab received emergency approval from the federal government, expected to be around mid-December. Officials say that by the end of the year they expect to have enough doses of vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate around 20 million people. However, it is likely to be April before the vaccines are distributed to the wider American public. In his address on Thursday, Mr Trump praised the speed with which a vaccination had been created, saying "two companies already announced [successful vaccines]" adding that several others were "coming up soon". "Some people have called it a medical miracle," the president said adding that the hunt for a vaccination "could have taken four or five years".', 'num_of_covid': 1}

One year ago, on March 12, 2020, Trump delivered an address from the Oval Office acknowledging the threat and announced new travel restrictions on much of Europe. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times WHAT BIDEN SAID: “As of now, total deaths in America, 527,726. That’s more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11 combined.” This is exaggerated. According to estimates from the Department of Veterans Affairs, a total of 392,393 died in combat in those three wars. Combined with the 2,977 people who died in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, that figure would be indeed smaller than the coronavirus death toll Biden cited. It would also be lower than the 529,000 death figure tracked by The New York Times. But factoring in deaths that occurred in service but outside of combat, the toll from the three wars (more than 610,000) would be higher than the current total number of virus-related deaths Biden cited. WHAT BIDEN SAID: “Two months ago this country didn’t have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or anywhere near all of the American public. But soon we will.” This is misleading. By the end of last year, the Trump administration had ordered at least 800 million vaccine doses that were expected for delivery by July 31, 2021, the Government Accountability Office reported. That included vaccines undergoing clinical trials as well as those not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. According to Kaiser Health News, that would have been enough to vaccinate 200 million people with authorized vaccines, and more than enough for 400 million once all the vaccines were cleared for use. The current U.S. population is roughly 330 million. And, contrary to Biden’s suggestions, both administrations deserve credit for the current state of the vaccine supply. WHAT BIDEN SAID: “When I took office 50 days ago, only 8% of Americans after months, only 8% of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is 65%.” This is misleading. When Biden took office on Jan. 20, the vaccination effort had just begun, after the FDA authorized Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in mid-December. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people between ages 65 and 74 receive the vaccine only after it has been administered to health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities, frontline essential workers and people over 75. It’s also worth noting that about 62.4% of people over 65 have received one vaccine dose, but just 32.2% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.

Still, the European medicine regulator said the vaccine\'s benefits outweighed the risks and could continue to be administered.Denmark suspended the AstraZeneca shots for two weeks after a 60-year-old woman, who was given a shot from the same batch used in Austria, formed a blood clot and died. It said the suspension was also prompted by reports "of possible serious side effects" from other European countries.Some health experts said there was little evidence to suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be administered. One expert told Reuters it\'s extremely difficult "distinguishing a causal effect from a coincidence." AstraZeneca told Reuters in a written statement that the safety of its vaccine had been extensively studied in human trials and peer-reviewed data confirmed it was generally well tolerated.

The administration is "contemplating new terrorist designations in Yemen that could complicate efforts to broker peace," CNN continues. And it authorized a huge arms sale to the United Arab Emirates that could heighten tensions throughout the Middle East.All of these moves are plunging the U.S. into tricky territory right before President-elect Joe Biden takes office — and that just may be the point. As one administration official tells CNN, the administration is aiming to "set so many fires that it will be hard for the Biden administration to put them all out." And by forcing Biden into some foreign policy decisions he may have wanted to avoid, Trump could be setting Biden up to follow his agenda even after he\'s gone from the White House.The strategy "could raise national security risks and will surely compound challenges for the Biden team," CNN writes. But if Biden quickly reverses Trump\'s decisions, it could also earn him respect and appreciation from foreign adversaries, people close to the Biden transition team say. Other experts noted that some of Biden\'s foreign policy goals aren\'t incredibly different from Biden\'s — withdrawing from Afghanistan, denuclearizing Iran, and managing China\'s aggression, for example. The two leaders just have very different ways of achieving those goals.

They\'ve also ordered vaccine doses from AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech. Indonesia\'s president who many call Jokowi was first up and received his at the presidential palace. "COVID-19 vaccination is very important to break the chain of transmission, providing health protection and keeping us safe. It provides a peace of mind for the people of Indonesia. And will it help to accelerate economic recovery." Instead of vaccinating the elderly and frontline workers first, like other countries are doing, Indonesia will start with younger working people. This is partly because officials do not have enough data on older people from the CoronaVac clinical trials. Indonesia has said its trials showed China\'s vaccine had an efficacy rate of 65%, but Brazilian researchers said on Tuesday it was only 50% effective. The government is also keen to kick start the economy after it suffered its first recession in more than two decades due to the pandemic. But experts have warned not to see the vaccine as a silver bullet as more research needs to be done on whether vaccinated people can transmit the virus. Indonesia has one of the worst outbreaks in Asia, recording a daily record of more than 300 deaths on Tuesday, and averaging around 9,000 new infections a day.

Nachman Ash said many Israelis had caught Covid in between their first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine, suggesting that the first jab is “less effective than we thought,” according to Army Radio. His remarks underline the importance of receiving a second vaccine dose, which according to recent studies is more than 90 per cent effective in protecting against coronavirus. Israel has already given the first of two jabs to nearly 30 per cent of the population and on Tuesday announced it would extend eligibility to those aged 40 and over. But Mr Ash is said to have warned at a cabinet meeting that a new strain of Covid originating in Britain was hampering efforts to tackle the pandemic, as it was responsible for nearly 40 per cent of new cases. It comes after two studies by Israeli healthcare providers found that the first dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by between 30 and 60 per cent. And according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, a survey by the health ministry found that around six per cent of 189,000 citizens who had received the first jab tested positive for Covid within two weeks. It also stated that 69 people from the sample had tested positive for coronavirus after receiving their second dose of the vaccine. Another study of a hundred people in Israel found that 98 per cent were protected from the disease once the second dose was administered. That research, carried out by the Sheba Medical Center, also said that a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine significantly refused the risk of spreading the virus to others. In Britain, there is a gap of up to 12 weeks between receiving the first and second dose, whereas the WHO recommends the second dose of Pfizer is administered within 21-28 days. Israeli health experts have stressed that it is too early to draw any concrete conclusions from the data.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': '1baa2c1142e86cd8022a980ecc9a07ab', 'title': 'Journalists’ Behavior over Luke Letlow’s Passing Is Abhorrent — and Telling', 'description': 'On Tuesday evening, Congressman-elect Luke Letlow’s (R., La.) family announced that he passed away at the age of 41 due to complications from COVID-19. He left behind a young family, including two small children, as well as a vast network of friends in Louisiana and Washington, D.C., all devastated by his passing.Some progressive Twitter activists and left-wing reporters couldn’t wait to begin their grave-dancing. Letlow deserved to die, they mused, because he didn’t take COVID seriously enough. They scoured his online presence to find any proof that he engaged in so-called “denialism.” Some, such as Vox’s Aaron Rupar, pointed to an October video where the then-candidate had the audacity to advocate for reopening the economy while maintaining state and federal precautions on coronavirus. Molly Jong-Fast of The Daily Beast also shared the video. Hundreds of their followers joined in, blaming Letlow for his own death and expressing that he was unworthy of pity because of his politics. For them, his death was further proof that those who dare propose policy prescriptions that differ from their own, no matter how rational or mainstream they may be, just have it coming to them.Setting aside the lack of evidence for their claim that Letlow denied the dangerous realities of coronavirus, the COVID ghouls and scolds clearly see themselves as worthy and qualified judges of their fellow man. It is they who decide whether or not people act appropriately enough to be spared death by coronavirus. As Michael Brendan Dougherty recently put it, they feel empowered to “turn every sick person into either a blameworthy fool or a blameless victim,” an extraordinarily arrogant and inhumane view of human suffering.In no other health circumstance would such brutality toward the afflicted be tolerated. We do not deem individuals who become sick by engaging in known “risky behaviors” -- unsafe sex, abuse of alcohol, drug use, poor diet, smoking, dangerous driving -- as deserving of pain and misery. So, mocking and haranguing those who become sick or die due to COVID-19, a novel virus from which we cannot possibly shield ourselves entirely, is unconscionable.But for these individuals, any expectations of their own behavior -- namely, to not be a terrible person in the face of others’ grief -- are secondary to soothing their own anxieties about the coronavirus. Blaming others may help them temporarily make sense of the sickness and death, but it can never provide them lasting relief from the unpleasant uncertainties this virus inflicts on us all.That doesn’t stop their callous campaigns from continuing. Look no further than the death of my former boss, Herman Cain, whose death from COVID-19 complications was touted as proof Republicans denied the risks of the coronavirus (never mind that Cain had a lengthy track record in both speech and practice of taking the virus seriously). These are the same individuals who were downright jubilant when President Trump and many on his team contracted the virus but are seemingly silent about COVID-19 diagnoses of other leaders who also benefited from ample safeguards, such as Letlow’s delegation colleague Congressman Cedric Richmond (D., La.) who contracted coronavirus while campaigning for Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia this month.Even among ordinary people, an individual’s desire to participate in day-to-day activities such as church services and dining out is enough cause to hector him for contracting the coronavirus. Prominent progressives, left-wing activists, and their media allies have routinely contended that if only Americans weren’t so stupid, selfish, and negligent -- and in particular, if red-staters could abandon their silly notions of constitutional rights and their incessant desire to keep local businesses open -- this pandemic would have been over a long time ago.But, for all the insistence that it is American obstinance that is perpetuating the pandemic, there’s not much evidence for such accusations. We are actually now masking at higher rates than ever before, which has been confirmed by observational studies showing broad compliance in retail establishments by customers and staff. Meanwhile, the TSA reports that since March 15, 2020, the rate of passengers passing through checkpoints is about 25 percent of 2019 totals. Americans have significantly curtailed socializing with others, despite scientists telling the New York Times that the data do not support claims that small gatherings catalyze coronavirus surges. And even as the very real pains of prolonged isolation and widespread depression caused by COVID-19 persist, the vast majority of American families have still greatly altered their holiday traditions by canceling plans, limiting gathering size, enforcing social distancing, and even requiring face coverings. The repeated insinuation that pigheaded Americans have refused to do what it takes to defeat the virus is tone-deaf, cruel, and simply untrue. In reality, we have sacrificed a lot more for a lot longer than anyone thought we could.And when the self-appointed COVID cops aren’t too busy condemning those who have gotten sick, they’re deciding who should be allowed to avoid illness via inoculation. With doses in the very early days of the vaccine rollout limited, they want to forbid Republican lawmakers from getting the inoculation because, as they again claim without evidence, they didn’t take the pandemic seriously. CNN contributor Ana Navarro-Cárdenas and liberal writer Kurt Eichenwald launched indignant tirades against Senator Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) for receiving his COVID-19 vaccine, casting blame on him for health systems not administering the vaccine quickly enough to frontline workers and even for how bad coronavirus has gotten in America.Of course, they found no room to criticize Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), 18 years Rubio’s junior, who received the vaccine at the same time he did. There was also noticeably no outcry about the highest-ranking Democrats, such as President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, receiving their vaccines after spending months portraying it as rushed and unsafe in hopes of scoring political points against President Donald Trump during the campaign. For progressives, COVID-19 denialism disqualifying someone from receiving a life-saving vaccine is exclusive to having different approaches to solving problems caused by the pandemic, but mysteriously doesn’t include fear-mongering the one surefire thing that will actually protect people.For the COVID nags, politics, not people, is everything. The pandemic has given them an opportunity to test out long-held policy preferences, including the government financially coercing people to adopt certain behaviors. To them, having a different approach is tantamount to wanting people to die. Wanting to spare your kids the developmental, educational, and social consequences of distance learning means wanting to kill their teachers. Missing the financial stability and personal fulfillment of having your business open? You want to stay in business, and thus, you’re okay with getting people sick. Feeling distressed because you can’t bury your loved one but watch large-scale political demonstrations take place without officials intervening? Stop being selfish.Perhaps most disturbing is the utter lack of qualifications these individuals have to make such judgments. They don’t have the humility to concede lawmakers across the political spectrum are forced to weigh ever-changing public-health guidance with other policy factors when governing. Meanwhile, no serious epidemiologist would ever expect policymaking to be dictated exclusively by health directives, but talking heads are convinced enough of their own expertise to demand they must be. They also seem unwilling to accept that with so many aspects of the virus unknown throughout the pandemic and the efficacy of many of our mitigation efforts still unclear, most lawmakers and the public are doing all they can to prevent any sickness and loss of life. Still, it’s easier to blame someone, and even easier if that someone doesn’t share your political philosophy.They do so at our country’s peril. While one may glean fleeting satisfaction by blaming others for the pain and uncertainty we’re all experiencing, the scars from the scolds will persist long after the pandemic is blessedly behind us. People understand they’re being closely watched and judged, and they’re acutely aware that those who disagree with them will find no room for mercy or compromise -- or worse, think them deserving of death because they disagree with their worldview.Instead, we should all try to be kinder and more gracious toward each other. Most people are doing the absolute best they can, often making incredibly tough decisions amid extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Nearly everyone knows the coronavirus is a threat they must take seriously. No one wants people to get sick and die, and it’s time to stop acting as if they do.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

If approved, Azar said the White House is preparing to ship millions of tests as soon as possible.“Take the simple steps that the doctors have talked about today, because there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Azar said.Trump’s COVID Task Force Is Livid Over the Trump White House’s ‘We Ended COVID’ ReportThe Thursday press briefing marked the first public appearance for the task force in over four months, despite cases and hospitalizations surging in at least 48 states. Notably, Trump’s favorite coronavirus adviser, Scott Atlas, whom The Daily Beast previously reported has been actively pushing back against state measures to control the deadly virus, was not there.At the end of the nearly hour-long briefing, none of the doctors and health experts answered questions—earning shouts from reporters as they exited room.Dr. Deborah Birx, the task force coordinator, urged Americans to keep following public health protocols after officials warned the worst is yet to come with the holiday season and winter looming. To date, the coronavirus has killed at least 250,000 Americans and infected more than 11 million.Earlier on Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving, and said residents should gather only with those in the same household (meaning anyone who has been in the same house for the past 14 days).Trump’s COVID Task Force: The Refusal to Concede to Biden Will Result in More COVID Deaths“Every American needs to be vigilant in this moment because we know when you are, we can stop this spread together,” Birx said. She said that while there are “more cases, more rapidly than what we've seen before,” the U.S. is now more prepared than ever. “We’re asking every American to remain vigilant.”Birx added that increased test positivity rates showed that community spread was increasing, implicitly debunking the president’s “more testing, more cases” claim. She directly asked Americans to wear masks and practice social distancing—two safety precautions routinely touted by the public health community and discouraged by Atlas.> Next to a deep red map of the U.S showing how coronavirus is surging, Dr. Birx says we are seeing “more cases more rapidly than before.” She says it increased rapidly because of a cold snap that drove people indoors. pic.twitter.com/5MXGErUf37> > — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) November 19, 2020“In this moment of bringing people together, [we ask you] to really limit interactions indoors, to immediate households,” Birx said. “People are spreading the virus because they don't know they’re infected with the virus.”Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, took the podium to assure Americans of the “efficaciousness” of the two “extraordinary” COVID-19 vaccines. He pleaded with people to trust Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccine candidates, noting that they were made quicker than anticipated but that didn’t mean they wouldn’t be safe.General Gustavte Perna, chief operations officer for the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, said initial distribution of the vaccine would begin within 24 hours after FDA approval.“The speed of the process did not compromise safety or scientific integrity,” Fauci said, adding that data showed the two vaccines are almost “to the level of what we see with the measles vaccines.” “This is really solid.”But while he stressed his excitement, he warned Americans to continue being vigilant. While the “cavalry is on its way, you don’t stop shooting,” he said. “You keep going until the cavalry gets here and then you might even want to continue fighting.”Vice President Mike Pence said hospitalizations have skyrocketed and test positivity rates have risen nationally to 10 percent but the Trump administration doesn’t support a national lockdown or the closure of schools.Just moments before the White House briefing, President-elect Joe BIden said in his own press conference that his incoming administration also doesn’t support a national lockdown.“No national shutdown, because every region, every area, every community can be different,” Biden said Thursday. “And so there's no circumstance which I can see that would require total national shutdown. I think that would be counterproductive.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Now he faces calls for his resignation and a federal investigation Andrew Cuomo speaks in Washington DC on 27 May 2020. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP On 20 March 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic was rampaging through New York, Andrew Cuomo announced new restrictions on home visits for older and vulnerable people. Unveiling the rules, named Matilda’s Law after his mother, at his televised daily briefing, the governor spoke passionately about the need for New Yorkers to care for one another. “Those three-word sentences can make all the difference,” he said. “ ‘I miss you’, ‘I love you’, ‘I’m thinking of you’, ‘I wish I were there with you’, ‘I’m sorry you’re going through this’.” It was, he later recalled, “a very emotional moment for me, and it was reported that I shed a tear. I do know that I welled up with emotion that day.” Cuomo’s Matilda’s Law moment – tears and all – was made for TV. Such displays of unrestrained emoting rapidly turned him into an American icon, the Italian American tough guy in touch with his tender side fighting for people in the heart of a dreadful pandemic. His daily briefings became obligatory viewing, pushing Cuomo to the center of the national stage as the empathetic antithesis to Donald Trump. The New York Times declared him “politician of the moment”, CNN fantasised about a “President Andrew Cuomo”, and even the far-right Fox News guru Sean Hannity heaped praise on him on his radio talk show. To cap it all, Cuomo, 63, got a book deal out of it. With characteristic hubris, he titled the work: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic. What a difference a few months make. Fast forward to today, and Cuomo is now facing calls for his resignation, an investigation by the FBI and federal prosecutors, and angry state legislators from his own Democratic party who want to strip him of the emergency powers they granted him during the pandemic. Andrew Cuomo holds a media briefing in Manhasset, New York, on 6 May 2020. Photograph: Lev Radin/Pacific Press/REX/Shutterstock As for emoting, there is still plenty of that. But it’s not of the “Matilda, I miss you” variety. One of the New York Democrats who signed a letter calling for the withdrawal of Cuomo’s emergency powers told the New York Post that last week he received an unexpected phone call from the governor. According to Ron Kim, an assemblyman from Queens, New York City, the call began with silence before Cuomo said: “Mr Kim, are you an honorable man?” He then proceeded to yell down the phone at Kim for 10 minutes, shouting: “You will be destroyed” and “You will be finished”. When the Post’s report came out, Cuomo responded by devoting a large chunk of his press briefing to an all-barrels attack on Kim, accusing him of a slew of unethical practices. The contrast between the untethered attack-machine of this week’s Cuomo, and the teary-eyed empathist he projected last March is so startling it has left many outside observers bemused. But to New York politicians who have for years been in the Cuomo orbit, it was as surprising as the spaghetti and meatballs the governor likes to cook his family every Sunday dinner. “Meet the Governor Cuomo we’ve known all along, beneath the Emmy-winning performance he put on for months,” was how Jumaane Williams, the New York City public advocate, put it on Twitter this week. The pandemic has exposed many things, and this is one of them Jumaane Williams The Guardian asked Williams, who acts as official watchdog for New Yorkers, to elucidate. “The pandemic has exposed many things, and this is one of them,” he said. “It’s been like a secret that up to now Cuomo’s got away with – his lack of accountability, the way he responds to political winds only when forced to.” Ironically, the area that has landed Cuomo in such hot water is precisely the same as the one that inspired his tear-laden announcement named after his mother – caring for older and vulnerable New Yorkers through the pandemic. Three days after he executed Matilda’s Law, he created a new provision shielding hospital and nursing home executives from potential liability for decisions that might lead to people’s deaths from Covid. As the journalist David Sirota has noted in the Guardian, Cuomo had received more than $2m from the Greater New York Hospital Association and its associated executives and lobbying firms – the very healthcare industry group that claims to have “drafted” the immunity clause. The immunity provision has had a detrimental impact on the ongoing investigation into Covid deaths in New York nursing homes which accounted for almost a third of the total death toll of about 46,000. In a withering report released by the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, last month, she says that it has led to confusion about whether homes that failed to meet health standards for containing the pandemic could ever be held accountable. James has demanded that the new immunity rules be scrapped. That wasn’t the end of it. Two days after creating the immunity provision – five days after announcing Matilda’s Law – Cuomo released an advisory notice. It directed nursing homes to accept patients back from hospital who were infected or might be infected with coronavirus. The homes had to admit anyone who was “medically stable” – no resident was to be denied readmission “solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of Covid-19”. The motivation behind the notice was clear – there was an “urgent need” to expand hospital capacity in order to meet the surge in Covid cases. In other words, free up hospital beds by getting older patients back to their nursing homes. The rest is history. A report by the New York department of health found that between the issuing of the advisory on 25 March and 8 May more than 6,000 Covid-positive residents were allowed back into nursing homes and long-term care facilities. There has been a great deal of debate about the extent to which the governor’s March advisory was to blame for large numbers of nursing home deaths from Covid. When the Poynter Institute’s fact-checking arm, Politifact, reviewed the question it concluded that Cuomo had not forced nursing homes to take in sick patients as his Republican detractors had claimed. But Politifact did conclude that the notice give care managers the distinct impression that they had no other option than to take the residents back in. As with so many other political scandals before it, the real trouble with “Cuomo-gate” was not the arguable errors that were made but the lack of transparency about what happened next. That’s what really bugs the public advocate. “My problem with Cuomo’s leadership is not that mistakes were made – mistakes are always made. But if you can’t take accountability for them and debrief what went wrong, then mistakes get made over and over again and people are dying for it,” Williams said. The unravelling began with the attorney general’s report last month which revealed that deaths of New York nursing home residents were substantially higher than had been recorded by the Cuomo administration. Residents who had fallen sick and died after they were transferred to hospital were mysteriously left off the official count. Then the New York Post dropped a bombshell. The paper reported that Cuomo’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, had admitted to Democratic leaders in a conference call that the administration had withheld the true nursing home death toll from state lawmakers. Melissa DeRosa at one of Cuomo’s daily Covid briefings in New Rochelle, New York, on 29 May 2020. Photograph: Lev Radin/Pacific Press/REX/Shutterstock DeRosa told them in the leaked conversation that “we froze” because Donald Trump was trying to use the deaths as a “giant political football”. What began as a dispute over health guidelines and immunity quickly morphed into a fully-fledged cover-up scandal. In the wake of the Post story, the state revised its official tally from 8,500 to more than 15,000 deaths – making a mockery of Cuomo’s long-standing boast that his state had among the best records in the country with regard to nursing homes Covid fatalities. On Monday Cuomo was forced to issue an apology, of sorts. “We made a mistake,” he said, before swiftly going on to clarify that the mistake was to create a “void” that had “allowed misinformation and conspiracy” to flourish. But he continued stubbornly to deny that death numbers had been massaged and insisted that everything had been done that could have been done to save lives. The semi-apology has left many dissatisfied. “It sounds to me like the ‘I’m sorry I got caught’ kind of apology,” Williams said. On Friday Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens in Congress, added her powerful voice to calls for a full investigation into Cuomo’s handling of the nursing homes crisis. “Thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers lost their lives in nursing homes throughout the pandemic,” she said in a statement. “Their loved ones and the public deserve answers and transparency from their elected leadership.” The public advocate wants an even more thorough accounting – a full investigation into every aspect of Cuomo’s response to the health crisis. There are leadership lessons to be learnt here, he thinks – rather less rosy ones than those the governor implied in the title of his book. Williams points to the stuttering start of the pandemic when the state took several days to close schools and ban gatherings; the classification of “essential workers” who were obliged to keep on working and who were overwhelmingly drawn from black and Latino communities; and evidence of glaring racial disparities now just surfacing in the distribution of the vaccine. “From infection to injection, the governor’s decisions have been wrong at almost every step,” Williams said. “He writes a book on leadership during the pandemic while at the same time hiding data, and people are dying. The arrogance is incredible.”', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty ImagesWith the U.S. facing vaccination delays because of worker shortages and distribution problems, federal health officials now say it’s OK to push back the second dose of the two-part vaccine by as much as six weeks. As an infectious disease doctor, I’ve been fielding a lot of questions from my patients as well as my friends and family about whether the COVID-19 vaccine will still work if people are late receiving their second dose. Why you need two doses 3-4 weeks apart Two doses, separated by three to four weeks, is the tried-and-true approach to generate an effective immune response through vaccination, not just for COVID but for hepatitis A and B and other diseases as well. The first dose primes the immune system and introduces the body to the germ of interest. This allows the immune system to prepare its defense. The second dose, or booster, provides the opportunity for the immune system to ramp up the quality and quantity of the antibodies used to fight the virus. In the case of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, the second dose increases the protection afforded by the vaccine from 60% to approximately 95%. Why the CDC decided receiving the second dose within 42 days is OK In the clinical trial, the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine was administered as early as day 19 and as late as day 42 to 93% of the subjects. Since protection was approximately 95% for everyone who was vaccinated within this time “window,” there is little reason not to allow some flexibility in the timing of the second dose 2. As more vaccine becomes available, the timing of the second dose should be close to four weeks for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. But the good news is that even while supplies remain limited, the science suggests that there’s nothing bad about getting a second dose as late as 42 days after the first. What the immune system does between the first and second dose The biology through which the mRNA vaccines induce their protection from COVID-19 is fundamentally different from that with other vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein. Upon injection of the vaccine, the mRNA enters into immune cells called dendritic cells. The dendritic cells use the instructions written in the mRNA to synthesize the hallmark spike glycoprotein, which characterizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. These immune cells then show the spike glycoprotein to B-cells, which then make anti-spike antibodies. Dendritic cells recognize viruses and present information about the spike protein to T-cells. T-cells provide information about the viral spike protein to B-cells, which are transformed to memory B-cells that store information about the virus. When this memory B-cell is activated with an infection or the second dose of the vaccine, this causes some of the B-cells to change into plasma B-cells that secrete protective antibodies that fight the virus. Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images The mRNA vaccines are uniquely capable of inducing a special kind of immune cell – called a T-follicular helper cell – to help B-cells produce antibodies. The T-cells do this through direct contact with the B-cells and by sending chemical signals that tell the B-cells to produce antibodies. It is this help in antibody production that makes these vaccines so effective. But not all B-cells are the same. There are two kinds that make anti-spike antibodies: long-lived plasma cells and memory B-cells. The long-lived plasma cells, as their name implies, live in the bone marrow for years after vaccination, continuously churning out antibody – in this case anti-spike antibody. These long-lived B-cells do not need to be boosted. The memory B-cells, on the other hand, live in a state akin to hibernation. They do not produce antibodies until stimulated by a booster of the vaccine, or are exposed to infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That is the reason we need that second dose. Together these two types of B-cells provide a constant level of protection. What happens if you don’t get the Pfizer or Moderna second dose on time? With current vaccine shortages, and problems with setting up the infrastructure to vaccinate millions of people, many physicians are concerned that the second dose of vaccine won’t be delivered in the prescribed three-to-four-week window. That booster shot is necessary for the T-cells to stimulate the memory B-cells to produce massive quantities of antibodies. If the booster isn’t given within the appropriate window, lower quantities of antibodies will be produced that may not provide as powerful protection from the virus. [Deep knowledge, daily.

{'_id': '7ff0548e85388b5b98afe71d85fa6aa8', 'title': 'For a Night at the Theater, Bring a Negative Coronavirus Test', 'description': 'BERLIN — On a snowy, gray morning last Friday, as a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany was taking hold, Anna Schoras, 30, lined up outside a pop-up testing site inside a repurposed art gallery in Berlin. Cultural life in the German capital has largely shut down because of the virus, but if Schoras’ test came back negative, she would be allowed to attend the first live stage production in the city in about five months, scheduled for that evening. “I’m just really looking forward to getting out of the house and to consuming live culture,” she said, adding that before the pandemic, she would go to the theater or the opera about twice a month. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Earlier that week, Schoras had been among the lucky few to secure one of 350 tickets to the show at the venerated Berliner Ensemble theater. They sold out in 4 minutes. The performance was part of a pilot project, coordinated by the city of Berlin, that allows its landmark cultural venues to put on a show in front of a live audience — as long as the audience members wear masks, maintain social distancing and present a negative result from a rapid test taken no longer than 12 hours before curtain. The test, which is included in the price of the ticket, must be administered by medically trained workers at one of five approved centers. Along with two nights at the Berliner Ensemble, live performances are being held at two of the city’s opera houses, the Philharmonie and Konzerthaus, and at the Volksbühne theater. Holzmarkt, a nightclub, will also host a sit-down concert. The short run of shows is intended to test whether organizers can put on cultural events safely, even as infection numbers soar. Despite an extension announced Monday to restrictions that have been in place in Germany since October, Torsten Wöhlert, the city official in charge of the project, said he was determined to keep it running. “The pilot is designed to be safe even when infection rates are high,” he said. But given a recent surge in new cases, regional lawmakers could be called to vote on whether to continue the project, Wöhlert conceded. On Friday, Berlin surpassed the health authorities’ warning level of 100 infections per 100,000 people in a week. The Berlin Senate decided Tuesday to move back three shows that had been scheduled for the Easter weekend, although others set to be staged before then can go ahead. Germany’s muddled national response to the virus has given way to local initiatives to keep life going, including a program to keep shopping and outdoor dining open for tested customers in some cities. As well as an epidemiological experiment, the Berlin initiative is a signal from a city that prides itself on its vibrant arts scene that — despite being shut down since October — culture still matters. “There is a big appetite for art,” said Wöhlert. “That was evidenced by the speed with which the shows sold out.” Of the 350 people who snapped up the Berliner Ensemble tickets for the performance of “Panikherz,” a gritty work examining eating disorders and featuring heavy drug use, everyone tested negative before arrival, according to the theater. (Those testing positive were guaranteed their money back.) The theater’s bar and coat check were closed, but in any case there was no intermission, to keep mingling opportunities to a minimum, and the compulsory empty seat between spectators, which was supposed to ensure social distancing, also made an excellent substitute coat rack. Berlin is not the only city that could benefit from the insights from the project, with findings expected in mid-April. New York is also experimenting with ways to bring back indoor live performances. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this month that, beginning April 2, arts and entertainment venues would be allowed to reopen at a third of their regular capacity, holding up to 100 people indoors — and up to 150 if they require audience members to bring proof of a negative test. Some venues are preparing to test audiences themselves. Others will also accept proofs of vaccination. But with New York City still reporting high numbers of new infections each day, real risks remain. Plans by the Park Avenue Armory to stage a new work this week by choreographer and director Bill T. Jones before a limited, virus-tested, socially distanced audience were postponed after several members of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane dance company tested positive for the virus. Other European nations are running their own trials. This month, the Netherlands hosted a series of pop and dance music concerts called “Back to Live,” with up to 1,500 tested attendees and no social distancing. Britain’s government has announced plans to run several similar pilot events in April, including at a nightclub in Liverpool. In addition to Berlin’s performance-venue project, museums reopened around Germany last week after the federal authorities loosened the rules. At the Alte Nationalgalerie in central Berlin, each visitor — who can visit without having to present a negative test result — is allocated 430 square feet of space, meaning that only 360 preregistered guests can visit daily, about a fifth of the number the museum would usually attract on a busy day before the pandemic. Tickets are sold out for the coming weeks. Ralph Gleis, the museum’s director, said, “You realize that museums are an essential space in society, where one can go to be distracted, to occupy oneself with external things — especially during a crisis, culture is really important.” But even that respite hangs by a thread. Although museums were open Wednesday, the rising rate of infections in Berlin could oblige them to close again on very short notice. Holzmarkt, a sprawling club complex on the Spree River, was the only nightlife venue to join the performance pilot. Although the club’s organizers said that they were happy to put on a concert for 80 people in a space where 400 people could usually cram in — with very few sitting — Konstantin Krex, the club’s spokesman, said that the management was not content with the rules that have kept the venue shuttered since October. “It’s a pretty long way from the real club feeling,” Krex said of the seated concert at Holzmarkt, planned for March 27. Even if the restricted performances lack the bustle of a packed house, the audience at the Berliner Ensemble seemed excited to be part of the brief reopening. The actors were nervous after a five-month enforced break, said Oliver Reese, the director. After the cast took its bows, the play’s author, Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre, jumped onstage to thank the crowd for being part of the project. “It is not a superspreader event — it is culture,” he said. Judging by the applause, the audience agreed. And when the findings of the pilot program come in next month, they will know if he was right.

{'_id': 'a8c6e00b7e1ab204088ef6a0ce3eb0b6', 'title': '5 Key Takeaways From Biden’s First Presidential Press Conference', 'description': "President Joe Biden’s first news conference in office covered a range of topics, including the migrant surge at the southern U.S. border, GOP efforts to restrict voting rights, foreign relations with China and North Korea and the timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. But Biden also made clear that his next priority is the massive, two-part jobs and infrastructure bill that he said he will announce in more detail on Friday, and he made news on other fronts as well. Here are five key takeaways from Thursday’s turn in front of the news media: A new goal for vaccinations: Biden opened his remarks by announcing a new target for Covid-19 vaccinations of 200 million shots administered in his first 100 days in office. The administration reached its previous goal of 100 million shots last week, and Biden said the new benchmark was “ambitious,” but given that the news conference came on Biden’s 65th day as president and that the country is now averaging about 2.5 million doses a day, the target should be reachable. In what could be seen as a sign of how much progress has been made in the fight against Covid, Biden didn’t get asked one question about his pandemic response during the hour-long press conference. That could also be a sign of the news media’s Covid fatigue and limited attention span, given that new cases are still averaging nearly 60,000 a day and deaths are still averaging more than 1,000 a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warned this week that case rates are increasing slightly. A focus on the infrastructure package: Biden said his “next major initiative” will be “to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure in this country so we can compete and create significant numbers of really good paying jobs.” He said he will announce more details Friday at an event in Pittsburgh. That proposal reportedly will be broken into two parts, one centered on infrastructure and clean energy and the other focused on domestic priorities including education, paid leave and child care. The plan is expected to call for some $3 trillion in spending, paid for in part by tax increases on corporations and the wealthy. “I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth,” Biden said Thursday. Biden’s plan is sure to face sharp pushback from Republicans, who have already dismissed the idea of raising taxes. Bracing for budget battles: Biden on Thursday derided the GOP’s fiscal approach. “When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea,” he said, contrasting that to what he called GOP support for “feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans.” In answering a question on relations with Beijing, Biden also reiterated his call for government investment in science and research as a way to compete with China. “Back in the ‘60s we used to invest a little over 2% of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it’s 0.7%. I’m going to change that.” Biden said the country must pursue investments in medical research on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes in addition to research on artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. Support for filibuster reform: Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, said the filibuster is “being abused in a gigantic way” and that he “strongly supports” a return to a talking filibuster, which would require senators to stay on the floor to block legislation instead of just raising more painless procedural objections. He also indicated that he might support going further. “We’re going to get a lot done, and if we have to, if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about,” he said. Biden also said he agreed that the filibuster is a “relic of the Jim Crow era,” but he didn’t specify what other changes he might support. The future of the filibuster could be key to Biden’s hopes to advancing major elements of his agenda, and Biden likely doesn’t have the Democratic votes he would need to eliminate the filibuster completely, leaving him trying to pressure Republicans into backing an agenda that he emphasizes has wide public backing. “Here’s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, to continue the politics of division,” he said. Biden expects to run for a second term: Biden is 78, the oldest president to take office, and there had been talk during the campaign that he might step aside after one term. He told reporters Thursday that he expects to run again in 2024, and that he expects Vice President Kamala Harris to again be on the ticket. Asked who he thinks he’ll be running against, Biden said he doesn’t think about it and has no idea: “I have no idea whether there will be a Republican Party. Do you?” Like what you're reading?

{'_id': 'eceeff9d59129c2469bdb050b0dcee02', 'title': "In Biden's Washington, Democrats and Republicans Are Not United on 'Unity'", 'description': 'WASHINGTON — In defining his mission for history as bringing together a divided country, President Joe Biden has made “unity” the watchword of his fledgling administration. But one thing that divides America is what unity actually means. In his inaugural address on Wednesday and in other public appearances, Biden reached out to Republicans with messages of conciliation, vowing to work together to tackle the nation’s enormous challenges — a starkly different tone than President Donald Trump typically took. But in Biden’s opening hours at least, the outreach was more about words and symbols than tangible actions. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times He did not appoint any members of the opposition party to his Cabinet, as Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama did, and many of the executive orders he signed in his first two days in office were aimed at reversing Trump’s policies and enacting liberal ideas, not finding common ground. He has offered no examples of Republican priorities he was willing to adopt in the interest of bipartisan cooperation nor described what compromises would be acceptable to win congressional approval of his initiatives. Biden and his allies, however, argue that unity means something different than concession — more of a change in culture, not splitting the difference on policy plans. After a presidency that salted the wounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation and culture, then sought to overturn a democratic election leading to a mob assault on the Capitol, unity can mean a renewed commitment to the broadest values of America. The two sides will still wage vigorous battles over ideas, so this argument goes, but they should be debates of goodwill rather than search-and-destroy operations. “Ultimately, greater unity will require broader agreement on the value of government itself, which is precisely why Biden is emphasizing competent government action as the key to recovery from the pandemic and economic crisis,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Senate and Clinton White House staff member who is now at the Progressive Policy Institute. Biden has long been an apostle of bipartisanship and cultivated close friendships across the aisle during 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president. But the incentive structures have changed. Where politicians used to perceive a political reward for at least appearing bipartisan, today they perceive risk of being accused of selling out by the more fervent elements of their own party. Compromise is seen by many as a vice, not a virtue. The flashes of cross-party comity on display on Inauguration Day were quickly fading by the day after. Senate Democrats and Republicans on Thursday faced off over rules to govern their evenly split chamber for the next two years as well as how to proceed with a trial of Trump, who was impeached for inciting an insurrection. Republicans complained that the new president’s agenda on immigration, economics and the environment advanced through executive actions and proposed legislation offered no gesture toward them. “Biden had a good message of unity,” Alyssa Farah, who was Trump’s last White House communications director before breaking with him after the mob assault on the Capitol, wrote on Twitter, “but the policies so far are aimed at only half the country, those who supported him, with no sign of outreach to those who did not.” At the same time, Biden will also come under pressure from the other side of the spectrum. Liberals in his own party will resist any moves that seem to undercut the policy prescriptions they favor out of what they see as some misguided notion of cooperation with Republicans. “To me, Biden can be most unifying if he continues to press forward on these bold populist policies that put money in people’s pockets, that help people feel they have opportunity again and that they have relief from this virus,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview. “That’s what he’s got to focus on. We can’t allow the idea of compromise for compromise’s sake to take away the need to really actually deliver results that people can see.” The pending impeachment trial of Trump has quickly become a lightning rod in the early days of Biden’s presidency, portrayed by the segment of the Republican Party that still supports the former president as an act of retribution that belies the gauzy language of unity. “I’ve got to tell you, it’s hard to unify when they’re impeaching a president who’s no longer in office,” Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of Trump’s strongest Republican defenders, said in an interview. “It’s hard to unify when we’re not able to make our argument because of the cancel culture.” Trump’s defenders said Biden should call congressional Democrats and tell them to back off. “His refusal to do that shows me that he really doesn’t have the ability or the willingness to unify us because that would a layup,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News. Democrats scoffed at that suggestion, maintaining that unity does not mean that accountability should be sacrificed. A group of Democratic senators filed a complaint Thursday with the Ethics Committee against two Republican allies of Trump, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, accusing them of validating the mob by challenging the Electoral College vote for Biden. “I don’t think it’s very unifying to say, ‘Let’s just forget it and move on.’ That’s not how you unify,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters. “You don’t say to a president, ‘Do whatever you want in the last months of your administration. You’re going to get a get-out-of-jail card free because people think we should make nice-nice and forget that people died here on Jan. 6.’” Biden has sought to skirt past the impeachment issue and focused Thursday on measures to counter the coronavirus pandemic that has already cost more than 400,000 lives in the United States, presenting that as a shared goal. “We can do this if we come together,” he said. “That’s why ultimately our plan is based on unity and all of us acting as one nation.” The new White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, later dismissed the notion that Biden’s opening policy initiatives have not lived up to his unity promise, arguing that unemployment insurance, reopening schools and speeding up vaccine distribution are not partisan issues. She added that Biden’s commitment is to listen to Republicans and treat them seriously, not necessarily to agree with them on every point. “They will say they’re not looking for something symbolic,” Psaki said. “They’re looking to have engagement, they’re looking to have a conversation, they’re looking to have dialogue and that’s exactly what he’s going to do.” Republicans complained that there was no dialogue before Biden unveiled his proposed immigration legislation to provide a path to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally while simultaneously halting many deportations and suspending construction of Trump’s border wall. Civility, they said, was not the same thing as unity. “Bipartisanship isn’t tone. It’s policy,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist and former chief of staff to Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. “And I think he figured out the tone. But that’s not unity. If you’re nicely doing radically partisan things, unity is not sure to follow.” Democrats scoffed at the Republican grousing given what they consider McConnell’s extensive track record of obstructionism, maintaining that the onus was also on Republicans to meet Biden halfway. Moreover, they said, unity does not require unilateral surrender of the promises Biden made during the campaign. “If they’ll work with him, he will work with them,” said John D. Podesta, a former White House chief of staff under Clinton and counselor to Obama. “But it doesn’t mean throw out your core program. And if he says, ‘I think you went too far in cutting taxes on the wealthy,’ and they say, ‘Well, that means you’re not serious about unity,’ that’s just a joke.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

This number falls short of the goal of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020."We\'d have liked to have seen it run smoothly and have 20 million doses into people today, by the end of 2020, which was the projection," Fauci said. "Obviously it didn\'t happen, and that\'s disappointing."Fauci expressed hope that the U.S. vaccination program will gain "momentum" in the first few weeks of January, but he added that there needs to be "a lot more" resources provided to states and cities "to help them to get this task done." Asked if the federal government should take over the vaccination effort, Fauci again suggested instead that more resources be provided to states."Rather than stepping in and taking over, I think it would be maybe better to give more resources and to work in tandem with them," Fauci said. "In other words, not saying, "We\'re taking over, we\'re going to do your job,\' but saying, \'We\'re going to really help you to do your job, particularly by giving you many more resources.\'"Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who earlier this month said the goal of vaccinating 20 million Americans this year should be reached, previously acknowledged that the number of vaccinations "is lower than what we hoped for," per The New York Times.

Vaccination rates are rising, new vaccines and millions more doses of approved ones are coming online soon, and deaths have dropped dramatically in places where significant numbers of people have been inoculated, especially nursing homes. But "this is not a time to relax," President Biden said Thursday as he celebrated the country\'s 50 million\'s vaccination.

"But they stressed that it is not an inevitable surge, if government officials and individuals maintain precautions for a few more weeks," and "COVID-19 deaths will most likely never rise quite as precipitously as in the past." "The good news," Mandavilli writes, is that "despite the uncertainties, the experts predict that the last surge will subside in the United States sometime in the early summer. If the Biden administration can keep its promise to immunize every American adult by the end of the summer, the variants should be no match for the vaccines. ...

{'_id': '1f81c08f8bdfb3de15248fa82a4f6ade', 'title': "Here's Why Distribution of the Vaccine Is Taking Longer Than Expected", 'description': 'In Florida, less than one-quarter of delivered coronavirus vaccines have been used, even as older people sat in lawn chairs all night waiting for their shots. In Puerto Rico, last week\'s vaccine shipments did not arrive until the workers who would have administered them had left for the Christmas holiday. In California, doctors are worried about whether there will be enough hospital staff members to both administer vaccines and tend to the swelling number of COVID-19 patients.These sorts of logistical problems in clinics across the country have put the campaign to vaccinate the United States against COVID-19 far behind schedule in its third week, raising fears about how quickly the country will be able to tame the epidemic.Federal officials said as recently as earlier in December that their goal was to have 20 million people get their first shot by the end of 2020. More than 14 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had been sent out across the United States, federal officials said Wednesday. But, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 2.8 million people have received their first dose, although that number may be somewhat low because of lags in reporting.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesStates vary widely in how many of the doses they have received have been given out. South Dakota leads the country with more than 48% of its doses given, followed by West Virginia at 38%. By contrast, Kansas has given out less than 11%, and Georgia, less than 14%.Compounding the challenges, federal officials say they do not fully understand the cause of the delays. But state health officials and hospital leaders throughout the country pointed to several factors. States have held back doses to be given out to their nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities, an effort that is just gearing up and expected to take several months. Across the country, just 8% of the doses distributed for use in these facilities have been administered, with 2 million yet to be given.The holiday season has meant that people are off work and clinics have reduced hours, slowing the pace of vaccine administration. In Florida, the demand for the vaccines dipped over the Christmas holiday and is expected to dip again over New Year\'s, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday.And critically, public health experts say, federal officials have left many of the details of the final stage of the vaccine distribution process, such as scheduling and staffing, to overstretched local health officials and hospitals.In one notable blunder, 42 people in Boone County, West Virginia, who were scheduled to receive the coronavirus vaccine Wednesday instead were mistakenly injected with an experimental monoclonal antibody treatment."We\'ve taken the people with the least amount of resources and capacity and asked them to do the hardest part of the vaccination -- which is actually getting the vaccines administered into people\'s arms," said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University\'s School of Public Health.Federal and state officials have denied they are to blame for the slow rollout. Officials behind Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to fast-track vaccines, have said that their job was to ensure that vaccines are made available and get shipped out to the states. President Donald Trump said in a tweet Tuesday that it was "up to the States to distribute the vaccines once brought to the designated areas by the Federal Government.""Ultimately, the buck seems to stop with no one," Jha said.These problems are especially worrisome now that a new, more contagious variant, first spotted in Britain and overwhelming hospitals there, has arrived in the U.S. Officials in two states, Colorado and California, say they have discovered cases of the new variant, and none of the patients had recently traveled, suggesting the variant is already spreading in U.S. communities.The $900 billion relief package that Trump signed into law Sunday will bring some relief to struggling state and local health departments. The bill sets aside more than $8 billion for vaccine distribution, on top of the $340 million that the CDC sent out to the states in installments in September and earlier in December.That infusion of money is welcome, if late, said Dr. Bob Wachter, a professor and chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco."Why did that take until now when we knew we were going to have this problem two months ago?" he asked.Michael Pratt, a spokesperson for Operation Warp Speed, said that there will always be lags between the number of doses that have been allocated, shipped, injected and reported."We\'re working to make those lags as small as possible," Pratt said.The task of administering thousands of vaccines is daunting for health departments that have already been overburdened by responding to the pandemic. In Montgomery County, Maryland, the health department has recruited extra staff to help manage vaccine distribution, said Travis Gayles, the county health officer."While we\'re trying to roll out vaccinations, we\'re also continuing the pandemic response by supporting testing, contact tracing, disease control and all of those other aspects of the COVID response," Gayles said.Complicating matters, the county health department gets just a few days\' notice each week of the timing of its vaccine shipments. When the latest batch arrived, Gayles\' team scrambled to contact people eligible for the vaccine and to set up clinics to give out the doses as fast as possible.Overall, Maryland has given nearly 17% of its vaccine doses. In a Wednesday appearance on CBS, Gov. Larry Hogan attributed the slow process to challenges across the board -- from the federal government not sending as many doses as initially predicted, to the lack of logistical and financial support for local health departments.In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott and top state health officials say vaccines are available in the state but are not being distributed quickly enough to deal with a critical surge of COVID-19 cases that is pushing hospital capacity to the breaking point."A significant portion of vaccines distributed across Texas might be sitting on hospital shelves as opposed to being given to vulnerable Texans," the governor tweeted Tuesday.In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday encouraged people to be "humble" in the face of such a complicated task and said that the pace of vaccination would accelerate. California has administered 20% of the doses it has received.Hesitancy among people offered the vaccine may also be slowing the rollout. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said in a news conference Wednesday that roughly 60% of nursing home staff members offered the vaccine in the state had declined it. In Florida, some hospital workers offered the vaccine declined it, and those doses are now designated for other vulnerable groups like health care workers in the community and the elderly, but that rollout has not quite begun, said Justin Senior, chief executive officer for the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, a hospital consortium.There are bright spots. Some states and hospitals are finding ways to speedily administer the vaccines they have received. West Virginia said Wednesday that it had finished giving the first round of vaccine doses to willing residents and workers at all of the state\'s 214 long-term care facilities -- putting the state far ahead of most other states that began vaccinating at these facilities under a federal program with CVS and Walgreens.In Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which employs some 20,000 people at several facilities, was vaccinating about 800 people a day, said Dr. Jeff Smith, Cedars-Sinai\'s chief operating officer. He said Cedars-Sinai expected to vaccinate all of its staff members who have opted for the vaccine within a couple of weeks.But other communities are falling short of that rapid clip. Smith said the medical community is worried about staffing shortages when hospitals have to both administer vaccines and treat COVID-19 patients.In a news conference Wednesday, Operation Warp Speed officials said they expected the pace of the rollout to accelerate significantly once pharmacies begin offering vaccines in their stores. The federal government has reached agreements with a number of pharmacy chains -- including Costco, Walmart and CVS -- to administer vaccines once they become more widely available. So far, 40,000 pharmacy locations have enrolled in that program.Most vaccines administered across the country to date have been given to health care workers at hospitals and clinics and to older adults at nursing homes. Gen. Gustave Perna, the logistics lead of Operation Warp Speed, on Wednesday described them as "two very difficult, challenging groups" to immunize.But public health officials warned that reaching these initial groups, who are largely being vaccinated where they live or work, is a relatively easy task."This is the part where we\'re supposed to know where people are," said Dr. Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.It may be more difficult, public health officials say, to vaccinate the next wave of people, which will most likely include many more older Americans as well as younger people with health problems and front-line workers. Among the fresh challenges: How will these people be scheduled for their vaccination appointments? How will they provide documentation that they have a medical condition or a job that makes them eligible to get vaccinated? And how will pharmacies ensure that people show up and that they can do so safely?"In the next phase," said Jha of Brown University, "we\'re going to hit the same wall where all of a sudden, we\'re going to have to scramble to start figuring it out."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

In a study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, a pair of Canadian-based researchers suggested an amendment to the determined efficacy of the Pfizer vaccines after just one shot. While Pfizer and BioNTech reported their vaccine was just 52.4 percent effective at preventing infection after the first dose, the researchers noted that this data includes results from within the first two weeks after inoculation, "when immunity would have still been mounting." After two weeks, that efficacy mounted to 92.6 percent, matching the first-dose efficacy of 92.1 percent reported from the Moderna vaccine as well. After two doses, the Pfizer vaccine is 95 percent effective, and Moderna\'s is 94 percent. The Canadian-based researchers\' interpretations of the Pfizer results led them to suggest in the letter that vaccine distributors delay giving people the second dose. This would let distributors get first doses to more at-risk people instead of leaving them "completely unprotected" — something the researchers called "a matter of national security that, if ignored, will certainly result in thousands of COVID-19–related hospitalizations and deaths this winter in the United States." Another study from January led Pfizer and BioNTech to say Wednesday that they are unsure if the vaccine will be effective at protecting against the B.1.351 variant first found in South Africa. The study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found the vaccine was still capable of neutralizing the virus within the B.1.351 strain, and that trials haven\'t shown the variant reduces the vaccine\'s protection in people. Still, the companies may end up creating a booster shot to ensure the vaccine remains effective against the highly transmissible strain.

Experts say that's nuts.", 'description': 'Experts feared the Johnson & Johnson vaccine\'s slightly lower efficacy rate would lead to an impression of a two-tiered system. That has been exactly the case in Detroit, where the mayor just rejected a shipment of the company\'s vaccine. CNN reports that Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan (D) declined an allocation of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine this week, saying the other available vaccines are better. "Johnson & Johnson is a very good vaccine. Moderna and Pfizer are the best," he said. "And I am going to do everything I can to make sure the residents of the City of Detroit get the best." Stat News\' Matthew Herper called this a "bad plan." It\'s true that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trials showed a 72 percent efficacy rate, while Moderna and Pfizer, the two other approved coronavirus vaccines, have a rate of about 95 percent. But health experts say it\'s still an excellent option, and has other perks like only requiring a single shot and frequently leading to fewer side effects, reports The New York Times. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\'s top infectious disease expert, said people shouldn\'t overthink which one to get, and explained the vaccines can\'t really be compared head-to-head because of different trial circumstances. Besides, experts note, the raw numbers don\'t show the full picture. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine prevented all hospitalizations and deaths in its large clinical trial, meaning the slightly lower efficacy rate really only points to mild to moderate disease. Detroit\'s mayor, however, said the city has been able to meet demand with just its supply of Pfizer and Moderna doses, but CNN notes Duggan\'s administration only expanded vaccine eligibility to residents ages 50 and older with chronic medical conditions on Thursday. Duggan said he would accept Johnson & Johnson doses later on if all other doses are distributed and there are remaining residents who want a vaccine.

His first priority, he told The New York Times\' Thomas Friedman, will be to push a major pandemic relief package through Congress, even before he gets into office. But that may be difficult while Republicans hold the Senate, which will be the case unless both Democratic candidates win their respective George Senate runoffs.Biden, though, is optimistic, for two reasons. On the one hand, he thinks he has a solid enough working relationship with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to get deals done, citing his days in the Senate and as vice president as precedent. "Let me put it this way," he told Friedman. "There are a number of things that when McConnell controlled the Senate that people said couldn\'t get done, and I was able to get them done with [him]. I was able to get them to, you know, raise taxes on the wealthy. I think there are trade-offs, that not all compromise is walking away from principle. He knows me. I know him. I don\'t ask him to embarrass himself to make a deal."But the president-elect also doesn\'t think holding the majority means McConnell will have all the leverage. If the GOP stymies a relief bill just to prevent his administration from notching a win, Biden said, that could lead to trouble for the party at the voting booth in the 2022 midterms. Biden argued that layoffs, shuttered business, vaccine distribution issues, and bankrupt states will make it challenging for Republican lawmakers to block legislation for too long.

However, while the FDA confirmed on Tuesday that the Pfizer vaccine appears to meet the standard for emergency use authorization, confirming both its safety and efficacy, there are still a lot of people who are concerned about its potential side effects. One nurse researcher, Kristen Choi, Ph.D., RN, wants to raise awareness about the "worst-case scenario" side effects of the two-part vaccine that could potentially save thousands upon thousands of lives if enough of the population rolls up their sleeves and receives it. SPOILER ALERT: She says take the vaccine anyway! It\'s essential to do so, to stop this pandemic! Read on,. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.The Worst Symptom Will Likely Be a FeverIn a perspective piece published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, Choi details her experience receiving the experimental COVID-19 vaccine in a phase 3 trial. She reveals that her worst symptom was a fleeting but extremely high fever — which happens to be one of the main initial symptoms of the virus itself — and that it appeared after she received the booster a month after her initial injection.She explains that after the second dose, she immediately started experiencing symptoms. "My arm quickly became painful at the injection site, much more than the first time. By the end of the day, I felt light-headed, chilled, nauseous, and had a splitting headache. I went to bed early and fell asleep immediately. Around midnight, I woke up feeling worse—feverish and chilled, nauseated, dizzy, and hardly able to lift my arm from muscle pain at the injection site. My temperature was 99.4 °F (37.4 °C). I tossed and turned, sleeping little during the rest of the night," she wrote.\xa0"When I woke up again at 5:30 am, I felt hot. Burning. I took my temperature and looked at the reading: 104.9 °F (40.5 °C). This was the highest fever I can ever remember having, and it scared me. I took acetaminophen and drank a glass of water. When the research office opened at 9 am, I called to report my reaction to the injection. Thankfully, my fever had come down to 102.0 °F (38.9 °C) by then."She continued to explain that the research nurse confirmed that "A lot of people have reactions after the second injection." She continued monitoring her symptoms, with her fever hovering around 99.5 °F (37.5 °C) for the rest of the day. "By the next morning, all my symptoms were gone except a sore, swollen bump at the injection site," she added.\xa0These Symptoms Are Worst Case ScenarioIt is important to note that Choi\'s symptoms are not a common side effect of the vaccine. Two vaccine experts, William J. Moss, MD, MPH, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins\' Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland and Albert Rizzo, MD, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, confirmed to\xa0Medscape Medical News that they are the worst case scenario.\xa0"The type of side effects we\'re seeing with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are typical of any vaccine, though there is a spectrum," Moss explained. "The numbers I\'ve seen range from maybe 2% to 10% \xad\xad— maybe up to 15% — of people having these kinds of really noticeable side effects. Again all transient. But some people have more severe [reactions] than others."\xa0Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said "prolonged side effects" from vaccines like this are "very rare," mentioning "side effects that occur" can include "immediate pain in the arm and the fever."Keep in mind that COVID-19 is responsible for the deaths of 1.54 million people globally. Of the survivors hundreds of thousands haven\'t fully recovered, with many suffering from prolonged symptoms for months on end. However, vaccine symptoms — even the most extreme — "are always transient, lasting 12-36 hours, maybe 48 hours," Moss reiterates.\xa0RELATED: COVID Symptoms Usually Appear in This Order, Study Finds"I Would Do it Again in a Heartbeat"Choi also clarified that it hasn\'t been confirmed whether she actually received the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was the placebo, but due to her symptoms she is confident it was the former.\xa0Choi wants to make it clear that she is all for the vaccine. "I would do it again in a heartbeat even if I knew I was going to have the same reaction," she said.As for yourself, follow Dr. Anthony Fauci\'s fundamentals and help end this surge, until he says not to, vaccine or no vaccine—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don\'t go indoors with people you\'re not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene and to protect your life and the lives of others, and don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Additionally, Pew notes that "much of the decline has come among Republicans and GOP leaners," 60 percent of whom approve of Trump\'s job performance compared to 77 percent in August.Additionally, Pew found that Trump voters "have grown more critical of their candidate\'s post-election conduct," as the "share of his supporters who describe his conduct as poor has doubled over the past two months, from 10 percent to 20 percent." The poll also found that only 29 percent of respondents said Trump should remain a major figure in U.S. politics in the years to come, while 68 percent said he shouldn\'t be.The poll was conducted in the wake of last week\'s deadly attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, which led to Trump becoming the first president in American history to be impeached twice. In the poll, three-quarters of respondents said Trump bears either a lot or some responsibility for the riot, while only 24 percent said he isn\'t responsible at all. Ahead of his upcoming Senate impeachment trial, 54 percent of respondents also said it would be better for Trump to be removed from office than finish his term, a possibility that has been ruled out due to the trial not being expected to begin until President-elect Joe Biden is in office.Pew Research Center conducted its poll by surveying 5,360 U.S. adults from Jan. 8-12.

According to all accounts, as his convoy neared an abandoned Nissan pickup truck, Fakhrizadeh�s convoy came under fire. The nuclear expert did not survive the attack.An eyewitness placed live assassins at the scene: A truck driver who saw the attack said that, after the initial explosion of the Nissan pickup truck, assailants started to fire from two sides. He added that an individual who was sitting on the road fired towards his truck. The driver says there were probably five or six assailants.Does Iran Have Secret Nukes in North Korea?The truck driver�s account is probably one of the most reliable, especially compared to the different narratives that followed. An Iranian documentary filmmaker claimed that 12 attackers were involved, and that none of the assailants was killed or arrested in the firefight. Fereydoon Abbasi, Iran�s parliamentary chairman and a former top nuclear official who survived a 2010 assassination attempt, quoted Fakhrizadeh�s bodyguards as saying that assailants exploded the Nissan pickup, and afterward snipers started firing at the entourage. Similarly, Defense Minister Amir Hatami said that Fakhrizadeh�s vehicle was fired upon, and then a Nissan in the vicinity exploded, and that the nuclear scientist later died at the hospital.But not all agree that live assailants took down Fakhrizadeh. A narrative has emerged from Iran�s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)�of which Fakhrizadeh and his nuclear research program were a part, and which was responsible for protecting the scientist�that a satellite-controlled weapon took out the convoy on its own.On Nov. 29, the IRGC-linked Fars News circulated a story claiming there were no assailants on the scene, and that a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on the Nissan shot and killed Fakhrizadeh. According to this account, Fakhrizadeh�s convoy was driving from northern Mazandaran Province, a luscious green area by the Caspian Sea, to Absard. A protection vehicle separated from the convoy to clear the path ahead. Fakhrizadeh exited his vehicle briefly, thinking the gun shots were a car accident, and was then fired upon. In another narrative�told on Dec. 1 on state television�Shohreh Pirani, the widow of nuclear scientist Daryush Rezainej (who was killed in 2011) cited Fakhrizadeh�s family as saying that Fakhrizadeh was driving one of the cars, and his wife was next to him. The couple got out of their vehicle and ran towards Fakhrizadeh�s bodyguards in the other cars of the convoy. A bullet stuck Fakhrizadeh�s shoulder. The bodyguard next to Fakhrizadeh threw himself on the scientist, but was knocked off after several bullets hit him, which left Fakhrizadeh wide open. Apparently, no bullets struck Mrs. Fakhrizadeh in this hailstorm-of-bullets narrative.In an interview with state media on Dec. 4, one of Fakhrizadeh�s sons claimed that his father�s security detail had warned him about the danger and urged him to call off his drive, but that he rejected it because he had to teach a class and attend an important meeting. (That narrative raises many questions about competence, and it is probably the IRGC trying to save face over accusations that it ignored intelligence.) In the same interview, and in yet another contradiction, the other Fakhrizadeh son said that his father was shot four to five times from a range of four to five meters after he stepped out of the car, initially thinking he was in an accident. Mrs. Fakhrizadeh was next to her husband the whole time during the assassination, and he claims that she said, �I do not know why none of these bullets hit me, I had gone [in front of him] so that the bullets would not hit him [Fakhrizadeh].�Apparently, the IRGC deputy commander Ali Fadavi ignored the state media interview with Fakhrizadeh�s son, going a step further than previous narratives to claim that a remote-controlled machine gun utilizing artificial intelligence and facial recognition assassinated Fakhrizadeh, while leaving his wife�who was only �25 centimeters away��unharmed.Mohsen Rezai, former IRGC chief commander and current Expediency Council secretary, went even further, claiming that the perpetrators used an �intelligent� satellite-guided weapon equipped with a laser and silencer. He pointed to a report by the armed forces general staff chief that the weapon in question belonged to NATO.There have also been conflicting reports about whether the vehicle was bullet-proof. Images clearly show it was not.> BREAKING Fakhrizadeh was killed after an explosion, shooting at his car near Tehran: reports pic.twitter.com/9Hu0Ez2b7N> > � Guy Elster (@guyelster) November 27, 2020The narratives of killer robots, worthy of a Michael Bay movie, betray a likelier truth: a small team of highly trained, professional assassins was sent by an adversary�s professional intelligence service that thoroughly penetrated the Islamic Republic�s top echelon and recruited high-level moles right under its nose.Amid all these contradictory accounts, Iranian officials have scrambled to explain the latest massive security breach. Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani said that intelligence services knew about the potential plot, including the time and place, but that the warnings were not taken as seriously as they should have because �the enemy� had tried to kill Fakhrizadeh for two decades. He also repeated the claim that a remote-controlled machine gun was used, adding that it was guided via satellite.A spokesman for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani said that the Intelligence Ministry, which nominally falls under the cabinet but also answers to the Office of the Supreme Leader, had warned Fakhrizadeh�s security detail, indirectly referencing the IRGC, about the plot several days before the attack. (The IRGC�s Ansar ol-Mahdi Protection Corps has been in charge of providing security to nuclear scientists, according to the unit�s then-commander Brigadier General Ali Nasiri in 2018, who once boasted that the assassinations of scientists stopped when the unit took charge.) The Intelligence Ministry, which has recently received a blessing to increase its staff by 50 percent, is trying to distance itself from the security failure and blame the Guard Corps. The Father of the Iranian Nuclear BombAnnouncing a special working group operating under the Prosecutor General to investigate Fakhrizadeh's assassination, Judiciary chief Ebrahim Ra�isi has demanded intelligence and security services to �not waste a moment� in identifying �infiltrating networks� among their ranks. On Dec. 2, the Intelligence Ministry claimed it had identified the perpetrators of the attack and vowed that Iran would design a �reciprocal� response after conclusion of its investigation. Then, on Dec. 8, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, a senior adviser to the Parliament Speaker, claimed that perpetrators had been identified, some arrested, and that the Islamic Republic would deliver �a firm response in a not-too-distant future.� He, too, pointed fingers at Israel. On Dec. 7, expatriate site IranWire, citing unnamed sources, reported that the Intelligence Ministry has attempted to interrogate several Guard Corps members in its investigation, but that the IRGC has warned it to back off, and that IRGC Counter Intelligence Organization would lead the investigation. Even though the sourcing for this report is unclear, the scenario is entirely feasible, given that the intelligence services are publicly fighting over the breach.Even before Fakhrizadeh�s assassination, questions arose of a compromised intelligence apparatus, especially in the IRGC. The past few years have seen Israel extract a tranche of Iran�s nuclear archives, a top general killed by the U.S. in a drone strike, an explosion at a nuclear facility this summer, and the recent assassination of a top Al-Qaeda operative in the streets of Tehran.Iran�s media and pundits have heavily criticized the government for the security breach, though hardline media are directing their blame mainly at the Rouhani administration. An editorial on Defa Press, an outlet linked to the armed forces, slammed officials for not taking the necessary steps to protect Fakhrizadeh, and accused senior diplomats of �smiling� and chatting with �Zionist regime spy Kylie Moore-Gilbert� three days before Fakhrizadeh�s death, saying that such diplomacy highlights the �weakness� of those �who extended hand of friendship.� (Moore-Gibson is a British-Australian academic who was taken hostage in 2018 and freed last month in a reported prisoner swap for several Iranians abroad.) Reformist pundit Mehdi Mahmoudian called on security agencies to stop �partisan games� and focus on national security. Abbas Abdi, a 1979 U.S. embassy hostage-taker and pundit, attributed the security breach to widespread corruption in the intelligence services. And the former Islamic Republic Broadcasting (IRIB) director Ezatollah Zarqami, a hardline figure, said that �the people� expect answers about �intelligence services� incapability in combating the Zionist regime and Iran�s self-restraint policy toward Trump.�Ahead of the 2021 presidential elections, the assassination has also provoked intense factional fighting, and several hardline figures have vociferously slammed the Rouhani administration. A 2021 presidential hopeful, the top IRGC commander Hossein Dehghan, who is an adviser to the Supreme Leader, said that officials must provide answers on the security breach and the �infiltration� network that led to Fakhrizadeh�s assassination. Rahim No�i-Aqdam, a retired Guard Corps commander who held a top post in Syria, said scientists have been targeted in the past decade because �the enemy� no longer feels threatened by officials, who are �useless� and influenced by �infiltrators,� referring to officials like those in the Rouhani administration. He called for a revolutionary administration to come to power. Hardline MP Javad Karimi Qodusi accused Rouhani and diplomats of a meeting between Fakhrizadeh and the IAEA that led to his assassination. (An Iran nuclear agency spokesman denied this.)To buttress its credentials, the Rouhani administration released a photo showing Rouhani bestowing a medal to �martyr� Fakhrizadeh in 2016 for his contribution to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran deal. Responding angrily, Fereydoon Abbasi, MP and a former top nuclear official who knew Fakhrizadeh for more than three decades, threatened that if �JCPOA supporters� want to �appropriate� Fakhrizadeh, then he would reveal �certain things about� Fakhrizadeh and �what he planned to do.� That was a reference to Fakhrizadeh�s covert nuclear activities that would undermine Rouhani�s ability to negotiate with the West over the nuclear program. Abbasi indirectly criticized Rouhani for pressuring state media to not reveal that Fakhrizadeh was a nuclear scientist when the news broke of his assassination. Satellite Pictures Reveal Iran�s New Secret Underground Nuclear SiteTehran now faces a tough choice between meeting expectations for retaliation�particularly as this is the third high-profile attack on Iran this year�and not blowing up the chance of new nuclear talks with the incoming Biden administration. Rouhani administration officials have said that Iran should not fall into a �trap� ahead of a nuclear deal, even as Rouhani eventually took a harder stance in vowing retaliation. Top IRGC commanders have promised a calibrated retaliation. Chief commander Hossein Salami said it would come at a �time, location and quality determined by us,� and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also demanded �punishment� of the perpetrators.The media has echoed this split opinion, with hardline and IRGC outlets calling for a harsh response, while many reformist and moderate outlets urge more caution and deft handling. Hardline daily Kayhan, whose editor is appointed by the Supreme Leader, called for a strike on Israel�s Haifa port if and when Tehran proves Israel was behind the attack. The editorial added that �intelligent and precise� retaliation would establish deterrence because �America, the Zionist regime and their agents are not ready for a war.� IRGC weekly Sobh-e Sadeq vowed that the Islamic Republic would give a �firm and intelligence response at the right time.� An editorial in hardline daily Javan said that Tehran must follow through with promises of revenge, especially considering it vowed similar actions after the assassination of Quds Force chief Qassem Soleimani in January and the explosion at Natanz nuclear facility in July. Otherwise, the editorial warned, the Islamic Republic�s word would be meaningless and thus invite more attacks. And Defa Press, linked to the armed forces, criticized officials and media who want to prevent or delay �harsh revenge.� On the other hand, reformist daily Arman-e Melli warned that Tehran should think carefully about its response so as not to fall into the �trap� of the Trump administration and Israel. Similarly, an editorial in the daily Ebtekar warned that Saudi Arabia and Israel wanted to antagonize Iran into starting a war with the U.S. And an editorial in the daily Iran, owned by the administration, called for unity in devising a way to respond to Fakhrizadeh�s assassination, saying that �we can strike a harder blow to the enemy if [we] strike in a year� as opposed to in a month.What is clear is that Fakhrizadeh was an integral figure of Iran�s nuclear program, which Iranian media have confirmed in his death, even though his life was shrouded in secrecy. According to Iranian media, Fakhrizadeh worked in IRGC nuclear research departments during the decades that Tehran insisted that its nuclear program was completely peaceful. Born in 1957 in Qom, he joined the IRGC upon its establishment in 1979, fought for some time in the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), and ultimately rose to the rank of Brigadier General. He had a degree in nuclear engineering, and joined the Special Nuclear Research Unit (Team-32) in the Guard Corps Research Center in 1983.From 1992 on, he became a science board member at IRGC Imam Hossein University Physics College, and �utilized this university�s capability for nuclear research.� He also headed the Malek Ashtar University of Technology. He had been flagged by Western intelligence agencies, the United Nations and nuclear inspectors for his central work on Iran�s covert nuclear weapons program that began in the 1980�s. The United Nations in 2007 designated him as an individual involved in nuclear and ballistic missile activities. Prior to that, Iranian media had said that he was a Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) official and a former head of the Physics Research Center.The nuclear archives Israel exfiltrated in 2018 show that Fakhrizadeh orchestrated the decentralization of the nuclear weapons program post-2003. Since 2011, the program has fallen under the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (Sazman-e pazhouhesh-haye novin-e defa�i), also known as SPND, which in theory falls under the defense ministry. Interestingly, Defense Ministry Amir Hatami has said that Fakhrizadeh was a deputy defense minister and chief of the Defensive Research and Innovation Organization (Sazman-e pazouhesh va no�avari-e defa�i), also SPND in its Persian acronym. That appears to be the same entity flagged by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and in the nuclear archives. Iranian officials, however, have claimed that Fakhrizadeh recently worked on a COVID-19 vaccine. Hatami later announced that SPND�s budget would double after the soldier-scientist�s death.Amir Toumaj is an independent Iran researcher.

American officials have said they do not believe Russia\'s SVR intelligence agency "pierced" classified systems and stole sensitive communications and plans during an alleged cyberattack on what may have hundreds of networks in the United States, The New York Times reports. But privately, per the Times, those same officials reportedly say they still aren\'t sure exactly what was or was not taken.There are concerns that the SVR — which the U.S. intelligence agency and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are confident was behind the breach, despite President Trump suggesting China may have been involved instead of Moscow — was able to get its hands on delicate, albeit unclassified information from victims like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It\'s reportedly possible the hackers accessed Black Start, the detailed technical blueprints for the U.S. would restore power in case of a major blackout. If that was indeed the case, Russia would theoretically have a list of systems it could target to keep power from turning back on.The Times report sheds more light on the cyberattack, which may not be fully understood for months or even years. Some of the revelations include the fact that the hack appears to have been much broader in scope than originally thought and that the hackers "managed their intrusion from inside" the U.S. by "exploiting legal prohibitions on the National Security Agency."

{'_id': '15e51afdb3bae0b9c98c1ed51559e42f', 'title': "A President Who Can't Put Aside Grudges, Even for Good News", 'description': 'It was among the most consequential weeks of President Donald Trump\'s tenure: Across the country, health care workers began receiving a lifesaving coronavirus vaccine. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers neared a deal on economic relief aimed at averting a deeper recession. And Friday, federal regulators authorized a second vaccine.Yet Trump was largely absent from those events. It was Vice President Mike Pence who held a call with governors Dec. 14 to hail a "medical miracle" and who received the Pfizer vaccine at week\'s end on live television. Legislative leaders were the ones working late into the nights on a stimulus deal.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAll the while, Trump was conducting a Twitter-borne assault on Republicans for not helping him overturn the election results, even warning Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to "get tougher, or you won\'t have a Republican Party anymore." By the weekend, the president was considering naming a conspiracy theorist as special counsel to investigate voting fraud, for which there is no evidence, asking his advisers about instituting martial law and downplaying a massive hack his own secretary of state attributed to Russia.Seldom has the leader of an American political party done so much to strike fear into the hearts of his allies but done so little to tackle challenges facing the country during his final days in office. Far from presenting the vaccine breakthroughs from Pfizer and Moderna as testaments to private-sector ingenuity and innovation -- once a conservative creed -- he was fixated on menacing Republicans who might dare to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect.That duality in Trump\'s behavior -- acting as a bystander while other leaders answered a crisis and simultaneously raging at Republicans who have inched away from him -- also amounts to a preview of Trump\'s post-presidency.He has shown no interest in shaping the debates that lay ahead for Republicans, in tending to the party\'s electoral health or in becoming a champion of America\'s recovery. Rather, he seems intent on using his political platform to wage personal vendettas and stoke a shared sense of grievance with the voters he has long cultivated as a fan base.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said the president\'s fury blinded him to his last best chance to buff his legacy: visiting vaccine distribution sites and clinics to highlight the possibility of hope after nine months of national misery."The president could have made that the hallmark of his last days in office," Romney said. "Instead, he\'s seen as promoting conspiracy theories and evidence-free accusations of fraud, which lead to a color of a sore loser."Some Republicans see an upside ahead -- especially those who have largely avoided Trump\'s fury.They believe the president\'s departure might allow Republicans to return to some of the themes that proved effective in down-ballot races last month, while also depriving Democrats of their most dependable boogeyman. In that rosy vision, lawmakers might step gingerly in public to avoid Trump\'s wrath but otherwise go about their business, assuming Trump\'s focus will never linger on one matter for long, while they elevate the perceived excesses of the left."When Trump is no longer in office, there\'s going to be less focus on personality and \'What did he tweet today? What did he say today?\'" predicted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, adding, hopefully, that Democrats would soon struggle with internal divisions in a "Tea Party moment" akin to what Republicans faced a decade ago.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was even more succinct, arguing that the Democrats\' left wing would alienate moderate voters."Our problem is tone; their problem is policy," Graham said of the two parties. "We\'ve both got to overcome problems, but I like our chances better because we can act better, and it\'s harder for them to legislate differently."Yet if that is the view from the lofty perch of the Senate, there is little evidence at the ground level of Republican politics that Trump and his divisive persona are receding as forces in the party. Indeed, Republicans have recently struggled to articulate what their party stands for other than fealty to Trump.Trump never espoused a set of plans for his second term, and for the last four years no one else has achieved the stature to detail an affirmative vision for the party. The coronavirus relief negotiations have also exposed serious ideological rifts among Republicans about the role of government in aiding suffering Americans.Many of Trump\'s signature governing achievements -- cutting taxes for businesses and the wealthy, weakening the Affordable Care Act and rolling back environmental regulation -- have been unpopular with many moderate voters.As apathetic as Trump can be about many parts of his job, some Republicans say they do not expect his grip to weaken on party affairs. Even if he is reduced somewhat in stature, they say, he is likely to remain the formidable figurehead of a personality cult.Former Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who lost a Republican primary in 2018 after crossing Trump, said he saw little evidence that his party was looking to Trump and the White House for a governing vision. But, he said, the "fear factor" remained strong."The default on the Republican side still is the status quo, which is: People have learned to be very deferential to the president based on self-preservation," Sanford said.It is fitting that the split outlook on the party\'s post-Trump future broadly falls along House and Senate lines.In the same week that McConnell publicly acknowledged Biden had won and privately instructed his caucus to refrain from challenging the results on the Senate floor next month, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, declined to acknowledge the president\'s defeat and did nothing to discourage a group of far-right lawmakers plotting a protest of Biden\'s election in the House.The House has long been more ideological than the Senate, in both parties. Every member of the Senate Republican leadership used their weekly news conference last week to welcome the arrival of the vaccine -- and not one of them approached saying the word Trump.House Republicans worry more than their Senate peers about Trump\'s supporters and the threat they could pose in future primaries, especially if whipped up by Trump.The two top House Republicans, McCarthy and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, both signed onto the recent, failed lawsuit from Texas seeking to overturn the results of the election. They were joined by a majority of House Republicans but not one senator.Trump\'s commanding influence over many in the party has driven a number of House Republicans to retire in the last two election cycles. One of them, Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan, quit the party last week out of dismay about Republicans\' attacks on the election. Mitchell is the second lawmaker to leave the party during this session of Congress, after his fellow Michigander, Rep. Justin Amash.Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va., who lost a primary this year and is also contemplating leaving the party, said he believed much of the Republican caucus was cowed by Trump and would most likely remain that way. He estimated that about 60% of the lawmakers questioning the results of the election knew that their claims were nonsense."It seems like the constant fight in the Republican Party," Riggleman said, "is trying to stop the lunatics from taking over the asylum."The strength of Trump\'s hold on the party will be tested in the coming months in Virginia, where two of the party\'s leading contenders for governor next year responded very differently to the Electoral College results. Kirk Cox, the former state House speaker, acknowledged Biden\'s victory, while state Sen. Amanda Chase called for martial law.Whether Trump intervenes in the Virginia race, how the Republican candidates approach him and what kind of response voters have to the soon-to-be former president may set the stage for the 2022 midterm elections, in which both parties\' fortunes may turn on the strength of the country\'s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.For now, many ambitious Republicans are glad to embrace the element of Trumpism that is most animating to the right: seizing on the most extreme ideas of the left. Such oppositional politics allows party leaders to draw attention away from Trump, reminds voters of what gives them pause about Democrats and has effectively become the adhesive binding Republicans together.The GOP\'s de facto platform -- that the left has gone around the bend -- was on display last week when a range of figures on the right, including two potential presidential candidates in 2024, Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas, highlighted a report that San Francisco was considering stripping Abraham Lincoln\'s name from one of its schools.With millions of Americans at risk of losing unemployment benefits, though, most of the party\'s congressional wing was focused last week on pandemic relief.The final major legislative acts of Trump\'s presidency may well arise not from the White House but from bipartisan coalitions on Capitol Hill that have filled a leadership vacuum in Washington. One such coalition, a loose group of centrists in the House and Senate, forged a framework for striking a deal on a winter relief package for individuals and businesses.While Trump\'s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has participated intermittently in the talks, the final agreement is expected to be settled by congressional leadership. On another matter, lawmakers in both parties have spurned Trump\'s demands to use an annual military policy bill to strip technology companies from certain legal protections, raising the prospect that Trump\'s final legislative fight could end in his first overridden veto.Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist close to McConnell, said Trump was squandering a chance to define the end of his presidency."Whether he likes it or not, a bunch of positive stuff could happen as he leaves office," Jennings said. "I would want maximum credit. He could sign all these things into law and be part of the process."Jennings said Trump\'s invisibility during the vaccine rollout was especially baffling. "If it had been me, I would have had Air Force One sitting on the tarmac in Louisville waiting for that plane," Jennings said, referring to the arrival of the Pfizer medication.But Trump has always been most formidable when on the attack, against Republicans and Democrats alike. As one of his most prominent critics noted, if the president continues to play the role of troller-in-chief, he will cast a long shadow over the Republican Party."If he wants to have a very active role and be on TV every day and be the voice attacking the Biden administration, why, he\'s going to set the vision of the Republican Party for the next four years and maybe beyond," Romney said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

A new variant is here, and it\'s more transmissible. That means you need to "double down" on some protective measures right now. Read on to see what he recommends—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. The New Variants of COVID-19 Will Put More People in the HospitalDr. Fauci said the new variant is cause of concern. "We\'re taking it really very seriously," he said. "You don\'t want people to panic, but you have to look at it from certain standpoint." He said there\'s one "from the U.K. that\'s essentially dominated. That\'s the one that is actually is seen in the United States. There\'s another more ominous one. That\'s in South Africa and Brazil. We\'re looking at all of them, very, very carefully."He said, "the Brits have made it very clear that it\'s more contagious. They say that it isn\'t more virulent, but, you know, we gotta be careful because the more cases you get, even though on a one-to-one basis, it\'s not more virulent, meaning it doesn\'t make you more sick or more likely to die just by numbers alone. The more cases you have, the more hospitalizations you\'re going to happen. The more hospitalizations you have, the more deaths you\'re going to have. The thing we really want to look at carefully is that does that mutation lessen the impact of the vaccine? And if it does, then we\'re going to have to make some modifications, but we\'re all over that. We\'re looking at that really very carefully."RELATED: 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say DoctorsWhat You Can Do Now to Beat the Mutation"I think one of the things we\'ve got to do, and maybe the silver lining, if you want to call that, is that when you have a variant, that\'s really very, very, different in the sense of it\'s more contagious, it tells you to do two things," said Fauci. "One double down on the public health measures that we\'ve been talking about all the time—be very compulsive as the President-elect says, at least for the first hundred days, and maybe more—everybody wear a mask, keep the distance, avoid the congregate settings, but also another important thing: The easiest way to evade this negative effect of these new isolates is to just when the vaccine becomes available, people should get vaccinated. Boy, if ever there was a clarion call for people to put aside vaccine hesitancy. If we can get, you know, the overwhelming majority of the population vaccinated, we\'d be in very good shape and could beat even the mutant."RELATED: If You Feel This, You May Have Already Had COVID, Says Dr. FauciHow to Survive This PandemicSo follow Fauci\'s fundamentals and help end this surge, no matter where you live—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don\'t go indoors with people you\'re not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

That illusion was reportedly shattered when Giuliani, Powell, "and a swelling conspiracy crew marched into the room" for a meeting.Things, unsurprisingly, did not go well, and whenever the two groups met, the conversation would begin with the campaign\'s legal strategies before Giuliani and Powell tok over. Swan reports that "bewildered campaign aides would look around the table at one another, silently asking what the hell was going on" before one person would "invariably shuffle out of the room." Every few minutes, another would follow until they all reconvened safely in Stepien\'s office down the hall.

Florida is among at least 18 states that saw cases more than double in July, when almost 25,000 people in the United States died of COVID-19.               The U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Friday predicted that deaths would rise in the coming weeks, forecasting between 168,000 and 182,000 total fatalities by August 22.

But this holiday season, online shopping will strain the industry as never before: An estimated 3 billion packages will course through the nation\'s shipping infrastructure -- about 800 million more than delivered last year.This flood of packages is hitting shipping companies at the end of a year of frenzied demand for everyday household items by a public largely stuck at home and wary of doing its buying in person. The deliveries could make or break some smaller retailers already on the edge financially because of lockdowns and fewer customers in their stores.Packages that don\'t arrive by Christmas will be a disappointment for customers but a disaster for these struggling retailers, which have been forced by the coronavirus pandemic to rebuild their business around e-commerce. The future of retailing is increasingly online, and companies don\'t want to give customers any reason to think they can\'t deliver.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"Everyone is preparing for the worst and holding their breath," said Ravi Shanker, a transportation analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It is far easier to lose at peak shipping than to win."To cope with the surge, the large shipping companies have expanded weekend deliveries and hired more workers. They have also played hardball with retailers, introducing steep holiday surcharges on shipments and enforcing strict limits on how many packages companies can send out each day.FedEx and UPS, the biggest private U.S. carriers, have enormous leverage over how many packages will be delivered and when, and some retailers worry about pushing back against their demands for fear of being cut off.But the carriers are also under pressure, largely from Amazon, which has been building out its own logistics business and is becoming increasingly independent in shipping. If more retailers falter this holiday, that only strengthens Amazon\'s dominance.By one accounting, 7.2 million more packages need to be shipped each day this holiday season than the system has the capacity to handle.That figure came from ShipMatrix, which provides technology to the shipping industry. Its president, Satish Jindel, said expanded weekend deliveries were covering part of that shortfall, "but not all of it.""Demand exceeds capacity, no matter what part of the country you are in," he said.Many brands, both large and small, have yanked forward order deadlines for customers who want to receive items by Christmas and posted reminders on their websites to order early.Beatrice Bakery in Beatrice, Nebraska, which expects to sell 750,000 pounds of fruitcake this holiday, set a cutoff of Dec. 9 -- nearly a week earlier than last year -- while the Disney Store is advertising a Dec. 10 deadline.Typically, shipping volumes during the holidays are 30% to 40% higher than at other times of the year. But those levels were being reached this year long before people started buying Christmas gifts. Even Amazon struggled to keep up with the demand in the early days of the pandemic.The shipping companies say they are better prepared for the holidays. FedEx said it was hiring 70,000 seasonal employees, and UPS said it would hire 100,000. That expansion pales next to the preparation at Amazon, which said it was building 100 new fulfillment warehouses, sorting centers and delivery facilities across North America. The company has hired 275,000 full-time and part-time workers since the start of the year and 100,000 seasonal workers to handle the increased volume.Major shipping companies are also preparing to distribute coronavirus vaccines, though most of those shipments are not likely to start until next year.Some retailers are already reporting delays.Executives at Kendra Scott, the contemporary jewelry brand, said they had discussed rising sales during the holidays with UPS but were told this past week that deliveries would be delayed because of capacity issues. On Wednesday, an alert about the delays was at the top of the Kendra Scott website."I don\'t know how it could be as unexpected as it appears to have been," said Tom Nolan, the brand\'s president. "We are not getting what we were told we would get when we embarked on our holiday season."Nolan said the delays were particularly frustrating because customers tended to blame the brands, rather than the shipping companies."We\'re paying a fee to a shipping provider to hold them to the expectations we have," he said.Kendra Scott employees scrambled, including moving goods to some of its 100-plus stores and warehouses that were closer to certain customers. But Nolan was uncertain about how the rest of the month would look."We\'re trying to work that out now and anticipate, coming closer to the holidays, is this going to get better or going to get worse?" he said. "This is not a free service that we\'re talking about. We pay a premium to get this done effectively, and the expectation is that it\'s done effectively."One retailer that sells apparel and accessories has already been grappling with UPS\' capacity restrictions and surcharges, which can add several dollars to a package and increase its overall cost by 25% to 40%, according to two company executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation from UPS.The parcel limits were based on holiday volumes from last year, even though many more people are shopping online this year. Once a day\'s quota is reached, remaining parcels must be pushed to the next day, the executives said, a move that can then snowball into other days.Overall, delays have been relatively minimal so far, analysts say. A UPS representative said the carrier was "delivering previously agreed upon, collaboratively planned package volume, but there are limits on unplanned volume until we have capacity in our network that we can steer it toward."Still, many retailers are urging customers to pick up orders in stores or curbside.Several major chains have begun partnerships outside the orbit of major carriers, offering same- or next-day delivery. Sephora and Best Buy have deals with Instacart, while Bed Bath & Beyond teamed with Shipt. But they are costly alternatives and capture a small slice of business.Helena Price Hambrecht, a co-founder of Haus, an aperitif brand in Sonoma County, California, said she had been told that starting Wednesday, the local FedEx truck would limit order pickups from her company to 500 per day through December. The company will use its own vehicles to drop off its remaining orders at FedEx hubs in the area."People don\'t realize the dance going on behind the scenes, and this year it all really came to the surface because the more layers of supply chain you rely on, the more things can break," Hambrecht said. "A lot of it is expectation-setting, but a lot of it is happening at the last minute because people are having last-minute situations come up. It really is the Wild West right now."When asked about Haus, FedEx said, "We work closely with our customers to understand their volume and identify opportunities to ensure the best possible service throughout the season."The shipping calculus for the smallest retailers leaves little margin for error. Doug Haney, who owns Bike Adirondacks, a cycling business in Saranac Lake, New York, ships his products though the U.S. Postal Service. This year, the shipping rates for smaller items like T-shirts and hoodies have gone up, and Haney is absorbing some of the costs."A $5 price point for shipping for a small order is what people want to spend," he said. "Otherwise, it becomes unappealing."Shipping companies are walking a tightrope, too. In some past years, they were criticized for not having enough employees to handle the packages, leading to delays. But in other years, investors criticized them for hiring too many drivers and sorters, lowering profits."You have to match the resources with the volume," said Shanker, the Morgan Stanley analyst. "It is easy to get that wrong."Consumers have been following unpredictable shopping patterns this year. Working from home, many started online holiday shopping earlier and during work hours. There were fewer online sales on Cyber Monday, after the Thanksgiving weekend, than analysts had predicted, leading some to believe that the shopping season is being spread out over many months and that a shipping crunch can be avoided."Some of this increased anxiety about shipping delays is real, and some of it might be manufactured," said Dave Gill, vice president of Insights and Analytics for Rakuten Intelligence.Richard Meyer, president of Beatrice Bakery, whose signature offering is Grandma\'s Fruitcakes, said he thought shipping companies were placing the onus on the merchants to manage expectations. Last week, he received an email from a big carrier advising how to talk to customers about shipping issues."We are the ones that have to do the explaining," Meyer said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Gina Bisignano, the 52-year-old owner of Gina’s Eyelashes and Skincare, and 37-year-old John Strand are also facing charges.Gold garnered national attention in July when she organized a press conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to condemn pandemic lockdowns and rave about how “hydroxychloroquine works” as a treatment for COVID-19. The doctor made a similar speech during the Jan. 6 insurrection, confirming to The Washington Post she was photographed holding a megaphone on the Rotunda floor. (In June, the FDA revoked its emergency authorization of hydroxychloroquine, stating the drug could actually do more harm than good because of its “ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potentially serious side effects.”)According to a criminal complaint filed against Gold and Strand, federal authorities were tipped off to the pair\'s attendance by The Washington Post article. In a 30-second video, Gold can be seen speaking in the Rotunda while two police officers stand behind her, gesturing at her and others to leave. While most of her speech is inaudible in the video, Gold can be heard saying “I’m a mom” and “massive medical establishment.”Uh oh.Looks like Dr. Simone Gold is gonna need a lawyer.Oh, wait... She 𝘪𝘴 a lawyer!Is this why her social media doesn’t have any images or video of her posted in DC?That’s okay.

Five people died and dozens were injured during the riots, as thousands of MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol and forced elected leaders to go into hiding for hours.Gold also admitted she went to Jan. 6 event with Strand, the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand and Gold were pictured in a photo circulated by the FBI. The doctor told the Post she was fired from her job as an emergency room physician for two hospitals in July after her speech—and has not worked as a medical professional since.The complaint states federal authorities received many tips that the pair participated in the riots, including several photos of them inside the Capitol building. One witness told authorities, “an old acquaintance was posting pictures of himself taking over the capitol yesterday. He was calling for a revolution on his social media accounts…[i]ndividual broke into the capital building and is paid to promote propaganda on his website.”In a photo posted to a Twitter account associated with Strand, he’s pictured in front of the Capitol steps during the riot. “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION,” a caption reads, according to the criminal complaint. Gold and Strand are also in a Getty video with a large crowd “attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time,” the complaint says, adding, “One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near” the pair.In an interview with the Beverly Hills Courier, Bisignano confirmed her involvement in the storming of the Capitol. Claiming she was just “caught up” in the moment, Bisignano told the outlet that she witnessed fighting during the siege—but insisted, without offering a shred of evidence, that the violence was “antifa and BLM.”ARRESTED: Gina Bisignano, 52, owns Gina’s Eyelashes And Skincare in Beverly Hills, California.

REPORTER, OFF-CAMERA: "What do you say to those waiting for COVID aid?"  ...and was seen golfing in Florida on Thursday.  If Trump does not sign the package into law, unemployment benefits for about 14 million Americans will lapse starting on Saturday and new stimulus checks, which could go out as soon as next week, would be delayed.  The standoff between Trump and Congress also raises the prospect of a partial government shutdown at a time when officials are trying to distribute two coronavirus vaccines – as government funding was also included in the bill.  Congress could keep operations running by passing a fourth stopgap funding bill before midnight on Monday. To successfully do that, lawmakers would need Trump’s cooperation at a time when he is consumed by his bid to remain in office beyond Jan. 20.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Congress is picking up right where it left off, which is to say Republicans and Democrats are still smack in the middle of their month-long standoff on a coronavirus bill, maneuvering to score political points and cast blame with little prospect for an agreement anytime soon.What’s new: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced Tuesday that he plans to hold a vote this week on a slimmed-down relief bill that would cost upwards of $500 billion, well shy of the $1 trillion plan McConnell released in July.The package would provide $300 a week in supplemental unemployment benefits through the end of the year, $258 billion in funding for small businesses, $105 billion for education, $47 billion for vaccines and testing, $10 billion for child care and $10 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. It would also provide liability protection for businesses and health care providers and reportedly includes divisive “school choice” language. It does not include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks to individuals or aid to state and local governments."It does not contain every idea our party likes," McConnell said in a statement. "I am confident Democrats will feel the same. Yet Republicans believe the many serious differences between our two parties should not stand in the way of agreeing where we can agree and making law that helps our nation."The package also includes at least $350 billion in offsets, according to a summary cited by Roll Call in order to draw more support from fiscal conservatives.Still going nowhere: “The legislation is not expected to advance, since that would require support from Democrats, who’ve held out for a larger package,” The Washington Post reports. “McConnell has struggled even to unite Republicans behind the bill, and is likely to suffer some GOP defections.”Politico reports that Senate Republican leaders are trying to find a path to get 51 votes, but it’s not yet clear they’ll be able to reach even that threshold. “The inability to get 51 GOP votes would be a big defeat for the White House and Senate GOP leadership,” Politico’s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer write.What it means: The move is an attempt to ratchet up pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “Senate Republicans and administration officials believe Pelosi will come under growing pressure from moderate members of her own caucus who face tough reelections and have been uneasy about the failure to act on additional economic stimulus,” the Post reports. “McConnell’s new legislation is partly an attempt to attract the attention of such lawmakers.”Pelosi and Schumer quickly dismissed the GOP plan. “Senate Republicans appear dead-set on another bill which doesn’t come close to addressing the problems and is headed nowhere,” they said in a joint statement, adding, “this emaciated bill is only intended to help vulnerable Republican Senators by giving them a ‘check the box’ vote to maintain the appearance that they’re not held hostage by their extreme right-wing that doesn’t want to spend a nickel to help people.”A bit of good news: One possible bright spot in the bipartisan stalemate is that Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have tentatively agreed to a “continuing resolution” to fund the government and avoid a shutdown at the beginning of next month.The bottom line: With only a few weeks to go before lawmakers leave town again for the final stretch of campaigning, a deal still appears unlikely.Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC on Friday that nobody wants another round of direct payments more than Trump, and Politico reports that the White House is set to take “baby steps” toward an agreement this week by embracing a $1.5 trillion price tag. But the overall price of a bill and the issue of state and local aid remain significant obstacles. Any GOP urgency to reach a bipartisan deal has also been diminished by last week’s employment report showing the economy added 1.37 million jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% — still high but down enough for the White House to continue to tout what it says is a strong recovery.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Friday told Bloomberg TV that, while a targeted relief package would be helpful, the country would be fine without an additional coronavirus relief bill. “We can absolutely live with it,” he said.Like what you\'re reading?

{'_id': '7d58c31ab6abc313de2ab99050e8c7c0', 'title': "Hospital Workers Start to 'Turn Against Each Other' to Get Vaccine", 'description': 'NEW YORK -- At NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, one of the most highly regarded hospitals in New York City, a rumor spread last week that the line for the coronavirus vaccine on the ninth floor was unguarded and anyone could stealthily join and receive the shot.Under the rules, the most exposed health care employees were supposed to go first, but soon those from lower-risk departments, including a few who spent much of the pandemic working from home, were getting vaccinated.The lapse, which occurred within 48 hours of the first doses arriving in the city, incited anger among staff members -- and an apology from the hospital.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"I am so disappointed and saddened that this happened," a top executive at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, Dr. Craig Albanese, wrote in an email to staff, which was obtained by The New York Times.The arrival of thousands of vaccine doses in New York City hospitals last week was greeted with an outpouring of hope from doctors and nurses who had worked through the devastating first wave in March and April. But for now, the vaccine is in very short supply, and some hospitals seem to have stumbled through the rollout.Most of the vaccinations in the New York region to date have involved hospitals giving shots to their own employees, a relatively easy process compared with what is to come as part of the largest vaccination initiative in the nation since the 1940s.The dynamics playing out at hospitals in New York City may be emblematic of what may happen across the country in the near future, when all adults will be given a place in the vaccination line by either the government or their employers.In interviews for this article, more than half a dozen doctors and nurses at New York area hospitals said they were upset at how the vaccine was being distributed at their institutions. They described what had happened to The New York Times but asked that their names not be used because hospitals have shown a willingness to fire or punish employees for speaking to the news media during the pandemic.At some major hospitals in Manhattan, doctors and nurses have recalled scrolling through social media and pausing to make a snap judgment each time they saw a selfie one of their colleagues had posted of getting vaccinated: Did that person deserve to be vaccinated before they were?"We feel disrespected and underappreciated due to our second-tier priority for vaccination," a group of anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai Hospital wrote to administrators over the weekend.Health care workers said rumors were proliferating in WhatsApp groups and amid the banter of the operating room. Stories have begun to circulate of a plastic surgeon who managed to get vaccinated early, of doses being thrown out at one Manhattan hospital because of poor planning. On group chats, doctors debate how -- and whether to -- try to get vaccinated ahead of schedule.At Mount Sinai Hospital, some doctors told others that you could talk your way into receiving a vaccine just by getting in line and repeating that you do "COVID-related procedures," one Mount Sinai doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, recalled.A doctor at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital said, "Clearly, we\'re ready to mow each other down for it."Many of the rumors have not been true. Still, they illustrate a growing distrust and "every man for himself" attitude, another Mount Sinai doctor said.Dr. Ramon Tallaj, who serves on a state task force advising the governor on the vaccine\'s rollout, said that ill-will and resentment would fade as the vaccine becomes more widely available."People are going to fight over who goes first, or who doesn\'t go first, but the important thing is that it\'s happening," Tallaj, chair of SOMOS Community Care, a network of clinics across New York City that treat many patients from Hispanic and Asian immigrant communities, said of the vaccinations.Health care workers and nursing home residents and staff members form what is called Phase 1 of New York state\'s vaccine distribution plan. About 2 million people are in this group, and the state\'s initial allocation of the vaccine most likely means that Phase 2, which includes essential workers, won\'t begin until late January. (Widespread distribution isn\'t likely to begin until the summer, officials have said.)But the state has left it mostly to each health care institution to devise a vaccination plan during the first phase. In the first week of vaccinations, many hospitals chose a wide variety of health care workers -- nurses, doctors, housekeepers -- from emergency rooms and intensive care units to be the first at their institutions to receive the vaccine. But in the days after the celebrations accompanying the first shots, the moods at hospitals have shifted.Asked about workers cutting the vaccine line at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian said in a statement, "We are proud to have vaccinated thousands of patient-facing employees in just over a week, and we will continue to do so until everyone receives a vaccine. We are following all New York State Department of Health guidelines on vaccine priority, with our initial focus on ICU and ED staff and equitable access for all."Still, The Times interviewed four health care workers at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, all of whom expressed resentment at colleagues and dismay that hospital administrators had allowed the vaccine distribution system to devolve.A nurse at Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital said she had gone as far as to confront a social worker who she believed had jumped the line about why the social worker thought she deserved the vaccine ahead of others."She said, \'We have to go to ER sometime,\' but that\'s not true," the nurse said of the social worker.At some places, doctors and nurses who work in dedicated COVID-19 units were not included in the priority group. At Morgan Stanley Children\'s Hospital, some of these nurses said they had yet to be vaccinated a week after vaccinations began."I think the sad thing is people are starting to turn against each other," one doctor who works at the hospital said. "Can you honestly say this clerk deserves it before I do? No, but nobody deserves it before anyone else."Another doctor working in an intensive care unit at the children\'s hospital recalled the scene last week: A group of staff members were striding energetically toward the elevator banks, where a vaccination station awaited. One of them even explained in passing that they were on their way to get the vaccine."It was a free-for-all," said the doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution from the hospital.Albanese, chief operating officer of the children\'s hospital, addressed the free-for-all in the email, placing some blame on the vaccination team for not limiting vaccinations to people on their list."We need to prioritize the highest risk teams," he wrote.At Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, the vaccine rollout has unfolded in plain view, in the hospital\'s atrium, which staff members crisscross throughout the work day or visit to grab a snack or coffee. Many doctors and nurses said they would glance over to see who was standing in line -- and whether that person fit the government\'s recommendations for those who should be prioritized."Despite our strict and stringent vaccination policies and procedures, we are aware of a handful of accusations of improprieties," Mount Sinai said in a statement. "Due to confidentiality, we cannot speak to any specific individual issue, however, any allegations of any missteps will be appropriately and thoroughly investigated.Last weekend, anesthesiologists -- who have played a crucial role in treating the sickest patients during the outbreak in New York -- complained that they had watched others get vaccinated before them.That led to the anonymous letter sent to hospital administrators."A boiling point was reached when we witnessed vaccines being administered, seemingly at random, to employees who were not a part of the originally-planned cohort," read the letter, which was sent anonymously in the name of "Concerned Faculty Members" of the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine. The letter was first reported by Politico.In interviews, several anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai noted that their colleagues at some other hospitals had already been vaccinated.The anesthesiologists said they expected to play a major role in the second wave if hospitalizations kept rising, and in recent days some in the department have gotten vaccinated.But just last week, an email from the head of the anesthesiology department, Dr. Andrew Leibowitz, asked for volunteers willing to work full time in a unit for critically ill COVID-19 patients if the outbreak worsened. Some in the department felt they were being told there might be an upside to volunteering."I am looking into the possibility of having persons volunteering to perform this duty possibly vaccinated earlier than they might otherwise be," Leibowitz wrote.Leibowitz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.One anesthesiologist said he recognized it was reasonable to vaccinate the volunteers first.But also, he said, it "felt that they were using the vaccine as a bargaining chip."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the Proud Boys a hate group.Files from the Blueleaks trove of leaked law enforcement documents reveal warnings that the Proud Boys, who some of the US agencies label as “white supremacists” and “extremists”, and others as a “gang”, show persistent concerns about the group’s menace to minority groups and even police officers, and its dissemination of dangerous conspiracy theories.Repeated warnings about the Proud Boys, and descriptions of them as a dangerous white supremacist group, were issued by members of the national network of counter-terrorist fusion centers. The Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC) showed particular, repeated concerns about the group, and their activities in that state.In a 22-page 2019 document titled Violent Extremism in Colorado: a Reference Guide for Law Enforcement, published by CIAC, the state’s division of homeland security, and the Colorado department of public safety, various incidents of violence involving the Proud Boys are discussed under the heading of White Supremacist Extremism.On page 15 of the document, the group is discussed in terms of the “threat to Colorado” from white supremacist extremists, and the “concern that white supremacist extremists will continue attacking members of the community who threaten their belief of Caucasian superiority”.In illustrating this threat, the document reports on local members of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, and Charlottesville’s deadly Unite the Right rally, but also offers that “there have been several incidents in Colorado between the Proud Boys and Rocky Mountain Antifa, to include violent clashes at protests”, and “two members of the Proud Boys were convicted of assaulting Antifa members during a 2018 fight in New York”.Two pages later, the same document incorporates the Proud Boys, along with Atomwaffen, the Soldiers of Odin, and skinhead groups such as the Hammerskins in a list titled White Supremacist Groups with a Presence in Colorado.Later, CIAC pointed to the group as a source of Covid-19 conspiracy theories. On 10 May this year, in a bulletin on Covid-19 Protest Disinformation Campaigns, CIAC described how “the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, has been active in spreading conspiracy theories regarding Covid-19 on Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram”, suggesting that “a faction of elites are weaponizing the virus, and a vaccine would likely be a tool for population control and mind control”.The bulletin also warns that “spread of disinformation has the potential to cause civil unrest and mass panic”.Agencies have defined the Proud Boys as a threat throughout most of their active existence.As early as August 2018, a brief from another fusion center, the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC), summarizes a report of rightwing groups gathering weapons before a rally. The basis for the warning is a July call from a named man to the Berkeley police department, expressing concern about someone who he knew “who is allegedly a member of the right-wing group called Proud Boys” who is “gathering masks, helmets, and guns and would have absolute war with the liberals at an event scheduled to take place in Berkeley on August 5, 2018”.A much-heralded Say No to Marxism rally was held in the city that day, and saw the Proud Boys and their allies outnumbered by counter-protesters.Mike Sena, executive director of NCRIC, told the Guardian that “everyone’s absolutely entitled to their freedom of speech”, but that “violence is a crime”, and that this kind of intelligence was passed to partners when “people mention the possibility of going to an event with weapons”.In 2019, the Texas-based fusion center, the Austin Regional Intelligence Center, warned in a Special Event Threat Assessment of potential dangers to the Austin Pride Parade.It identified the Proud Boys as being associated with a “growing backlash against Pride Month [which] has emerged in the form of the Straight Pride movement”, noting that “on 28 June 2019, a Trans Pride parade event in Seattle, Washington was disrupted by the alt-right Proud Boys organization”.There is also evidence of concern about the group from local agencies, some of whom define the Proud Boys as a gang.In 2019, a flyer from the Orange county, California, probation department advertised a “One Day Law Enforcement Training” day covering “white gangs”.In one session of the training day on 19 April, the flyer said, two probation officers would “delve into ideological groups including KKK in Orange county as well as other hate groups/gangs including RAM (Rise Above Movement), Proud Boys, Traditionalist Worker’s Party, Hammerskins, WAR, and cover Antifa and sovereign citizens”.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

People learned about national vulnerabilities most had never considered, and about depths of resilience they never imagined needing except in wartime. Even the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, for all their horror and the two decades of war they ushered in, did not change day-to-day life in every city and town in the United States quite the way the coronavirus did. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times One president lost his job in large part for mishandling a crisis whose magnitude he first denied. His successor knows his legacy depends on bringing the catastrophe to a swift conclusion. The halting response demonstrated both the worst of American governance and then, from Operation Warp Speed’s 10-month sprint to vaccines to the frantic pace of inoculations in recent days, the very best. The economic earthquake as cities and towns shuttered so altered politics that Congress did something that would have been unimaginable a year ago this week. Lawmakers spent $5 trillion to dig the nation out of the economic hole created by the virus, and almost as a political aftershock, enacted an expansion of the social safety net larger than any seen since the creation of Medicare nearly 60 years ago. No country can go through this kind of trauma without being forever changed. There were indelible moments. In the spring came the racial reckoning brought on by the death of George Floyd after a police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. On Jan. 6 came the mob attack on the Capitol that led many to wonder whether American democracy was still capable of self-correction. But Biden’s message on Thursday centered on the theme that the country did finally come together in a common cause — vaccines as the road to normalcy — and from that could spring a glimmer of unity, as a still divided nation seeks solace in millions of tiny jabs in the arm. In his speech, Biden held out two distinct dates of hope: May 1, when all adults in the United States will be eligible to receive a vaccine, and July 4, when modest Independence Day celebrations might resemble life a little like it once was. Jill Lepore, a Harvard historian whose book “These Truths” tracks the changing dynamics of technology and society in America since its discovery, wondered if Americans were unconsciously considering the new year as starting in late March, as it did in Britain and its colonies until the calendar changed in 1752. “Or maybe it begins the day you get your vaccine,” she said. “Or the day enough of us get a vaccine.” For Biden, the question is when he will be able to pivot from what he has called the “rescue” phase of the pandemic to the “recovery” phase after the pandemic. In his speech on Thursday, the president made it clear that the rescue was still underway. His goal, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, said in an interview, is “laying up the next steps in this rescue and what, now that we’ve got this bill passed, are we really going to do in the coming months to get back toward a more normal way of life in this country.” All of Biden’s instincts tell him that declaring a move to recovery too soon carries dangers. It would signal that states could follow the example of Texas, eliminating mask mandates, opening restaurants and bars too quickly, and making themselves vulnerable to a resurgence — what Biden called “Neanderthal thinking.” He said as much in the speech, arguing, “This is not the time to let up.” “We need everyone to get vaccinated,” he said, an unspoken recognition that soon there may be more supply than willing takers. “Keep wearing a mask,” because “beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.” Though Biden made no mention of it, his top Cabinet members have emphasized that even eliminating the virus at home is not enough. As his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said last month, “Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it’s also going to be mutating.” “And if it’s mutating,” he added, “it’s also going to come back and bite people everywhere.” But the subtext of Biden’s message on Thursday evening, was that for the first time, people can begin to imagine a post-COVID world. After a year behind closed doors, the government can start to think about managing the virus to the point where it does not drive every policy decision, and families can find a way to go to dinner, or visit grandparents, without wondering whether it is a life-or-death decision. All of which raises the question of what will be permanently changed and what, when the history of this national trauma is written, will prove recoverable. And what will the country have learned? The past provides a mixed guide. There were too few lessons gleaned from the 1918 pandemic, an event that most history books overlooked, and that many Americans first heard about in any detail a century later, when it returned to afflict the nation in a different form. But in 1918, as in 2020, the president’s instinct was to play down its severity, invoking the odd logic that Americans would be dispirited by the truth even as their family and friends succumbed around them. President Donald Trump has never been a student of history (although his grandfather Frederick Trump died of the flu in 1918), and he told journalist Bob Woodward that “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down,” because “I don’t want to create a panic.” No one will know how many thousands of lives that cost as Trump ridiculed mask-wearing and did so little to promote the vaccine in the last days of his administration when it moved from laboratory to market in record time. “Denials for days, weeks, then months,” Biden said Thursday night, without ever mentioning his predecessor by name. “That led to more deaths, more infections, more stress and more loneliness." Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom Biden deliberately made his top medical adviser, also referred to those unnecessary deaths on Thursday when he said on NBC that a year ago this week, “it would have shocked me completely” to know that more than half a million Americans would die of the disease. But he noted that the country paid a horrific price for its political divisions. “Even simple common-sense health measures took on a political connotation,” he said. “It wasn’t a pure public health approach. It was very much influenced by the divisiveness we have in this country.” When Trump and his wife received the vaccine in January, they did not make it public. It was left to Biden and members of his administration to be inoculated on live television as an encouragement to those Americans fearful of the vaccine. The second big lesson may be that when properly organized, the same government that mobilized for World War II and landed men on the moon can in fact save lives on a mass scale. To the Biden administration, that meant taking the vaccines developed in record time and devising a vital distribution system. Operation Warp Speed “was very important work, and I don’t mean to minimize it,” Klain said. “But there was no plan for how we were going to get this vaccine into the arms of tens, and ultimately hundreds, of millions of Americans.” When the history of this strange moment is written, Biden will almost certainly be credited for getting a quarter of the adult population vaccinated with at least one shot, and 10% fully vaccinated, in his first 50 days. After years in which government was denigrated as more of an impediment to national greatness than a vehicle of progress, when conspiracy theories about a pernicious “deep state” still abound, he made the case on Thursday night that a simple show of government competence was itself a turning point. “What we don’t know is whether that translates into encouraging people into public service, or at least trusting that the government can get something done right,” said Richard Haass, a longtime diplomat and now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “After 9/11, we rose to the task of fighting global terrorism. After COVID-19, we rose to a different task.” “It remains to be seen,” he said, “whether we can now also use the moment to lessen the effects of domestic division.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The country closed its international borders back in March and currently requires all overseas arrivals to quarantine for two weeks. Qantas is one of the first major airlines to raise the possibility of a vaccine requirement. But in a Monday interview (November 23), CEO Alan Joyce said others may soon follow suit. "I\'m talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe and I think it\'s going to be a common theme across the board. What we\'re looking at is how to you can have a vaccination passport, an electronic version of it, that certifies what the vaccine is, is it acceptable to the country you are travelling to, so there\'s a lot of logistics, a lot of technology, that will be needed to put in place to make this happen, but the airlines and the governments are working on this as we speak." Joyce added that it\'s unclear whether or not domestic travelers, within Australia, will also be asked for vaccinations. His comments came as Australia announced Tuesday it would further lift internal travel restrictions. The border between the country\'s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, opened on Monday.

Givens thought he had a sinus infection.His wife, Veneshia Givens, said she believed "deep down" it was the coronavirus. Robert Givens, 51, went to the urgent care center, but doctors did not give him a coronavirus test, his wife said. Instead, they sent him home with sinus medication. After that, Robert Givens thought little more of his illness and returned to work as a longshoreman at the Port of New Orleans.Days later, his headache worsened and his breathing labored. Then, he was admitted into the intensive care unit. Weeks later, he died of the coronavirus.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAround the same time, his childhood friend and fellow longshoreman, Windell B. La Cour, died from the virus. Then, another friend and colleague on the docks, David Page, tested positive for the virus and was out of work for weeks in recovery. The union\'s local president, David Magee, also contracted the virus, and spent weeks in the hospital."It was like a domino effect," Veneshia Givens said.The outbreak shook the port community, and nearly caused the Port of New Orleans to shut down, local union officials said. Henry Glover, 48, who gives longshore workers in New Orleans their daily job assignments, remembers colleagues frantically calling him in the days after, refusing to go to work, worried they would be the next to get the virus and die.Veneshia Givens was so worried that the working conditions at the port caused her husband\'s death that she prevented her son from going back to work as a longshoreman until the pandemic fades."I lost my husband," she said. "I don\'t want to lose my child, too."The coronavirus is surging again, and outbreaks are starting to reemerge in ports across the country. In interviews with over a dozen longshoremen, their families and maritime officials at multiple ports in the United States, all urged government officials to recognize the essential nature of longshore work and protect individuals from conditions that make it ripe for the virus to spread.In particular, they say longshore workers should be provided rapid testing and early access to the coronavirus vaccine so they can remain on the job and prevent outbreaks from shutting the nation\'s ports."We\'re hidden," said Kenneth Riley, president of the local longshoremen\'s union in Charleston, South Carolina. "But if you think some of the store shelves were empty as we got into this pandemic, let these ports shut down and see how empty they\'ll be."Longshore work is exhausting, and often requires close contact with others. The trade is essential to the economy, with longshore workers serving as a crucial link between moving goods from a shipping vessel onto trucks and trains that send them to their final destination, experts said.Over 95% of overseas trade for the United States flows through one of around 150 deep-water ports in the country, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.The workers at highest risk of being exposed to the virus are deep sea longshoremen, who are primarily Black and do most of the work that requires the lifting and moving of goods, union officials noted.Lashers, who take steel rods off containers so they can be lifted by crane operators, sweat and breathe heavily as they work in pairs side by side. Shuttle drivers, responsible for transporting their fellow longshoremen to and from either ends of a dock that can stretch for miles, spend their days packed in Ford Crown Victorias and school buses with other longshoremen."It\'s very high risk," said Gail Jackson, 45, a shuttle driver on the docks in Charleston who contracted the virus and spent weeks off the job. "There\'s no way for us to be 6 feet distanced."The International Longshoremen\'s Association, a union that represents about 65,000 longshore workers, has lobbied the federal government and state officials for support. In a letter in September to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, union officials asked that longshore workers be provided personal protective equipment, sanitizer and rapid coronavirus tests, saying the officials who operate the terminals where longshore workers operate have "provided no protective equipment to our members despite COVID-19 risks."They added that many of their local unions were working to shield longshoremen from the virus by trying to provide protective equipment. They said some ports, such as the one in Charleston, are spending upward of $200,000 a week to protect their workers from large-scale outbreaks on the docks that would grind their work to a halt and cause significant delays in shipping goods to consumers. "This is not sustainable," the union\'s president, Harold J. Daggett, wrote of the costs.In May, the Transportation Department provided longshore workers with cloth facial coverings, as part of its effort to donate 15.5 million masks to transportation workers. Since then, they have not provided any other protective equipment, sanitizer or rapid tests to port workers, according to union officials. The transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, has been reluctant to involve the federal government in protecting transportation workers from the pandemic, saying it is a "labor-management" issue in an interview in June with Politico."The Department of Transportation does not make public health decisions, that authority lies with HHS and CDC," a department spokesperson said. "Secretary Chao and the department have consistently and strongly encouraged passengers and transportation workers follow CDC guidelines, including wearing face coverings."On Capitol Hill, there is a provision in the INVEST in America Act, a transportation overhaul bill, that calls for a mandatory mask mandate for transportation workers, including longshoremen. But that bill, which has passed the House, is stalled in the Republican-led Senate. A stand-alone bill in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., has the same provision but has not been put to a vote.This month, two federal maritime commissioners urged the CDC and the Transportation Department to provide port workers with rapid coronavirus testing and early access to the coronavirus vaccine. They added that outbreaks have started to reemerge in ports like Charleston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, "causing substantial requirements for quarantine and threatening freight movement through these ports." Union officials in the Gulf Coast region have also started lobbying their state governors to be considered for early access to the vaccine, union representatives said.Daniel B. Maffei, a federal maritime commissioner appointed by President Barack Obama, said if port workers were not provided vaccines in this first wave, potential outbreaks could sideline longshore workers as ports face increases in cargo volume because of the confluence of changed spending habits during the pandemic, the holiday shopping season and the continuing need for personal protective equipment."If longshoremen have to stay home because they\'re still vulnerable to COVID," Maffei said in an interview, "it\'s going to be a perfect storm that could jam the entire supply chain." He added that truckers and other transport workers were equally essential.Industry experts say that longshore workers represented by unions that have strong political connections and robust funds from union dues are able to provide workers more protection, including advice from local medical experts on how to ensure social distancing on the docks, on-site coronavirus testing and temperature screenings.But others with less power and money, including ports that are smaller, are still asking for resources from government officials and are having trouble paying for things like masks, hand sanitizer and rapid tests.Christopher Hammond, 49, a longshoreman in New Orleans, who handles the finances for the workers\' union in the city, said he still had no funding to provide his workers coronavirus tests. "There\'s a real problem," he said. "We can\'t even gauge the level of people that are infected because we can\'t test." At least four longshoremen have died at the port, according to union representatives.Many officials note that since the nature of longshore work is day labor, workers may look for any reason to escape getting tested unless they show symptoms to prevent going weeks without pay as they isolate."There are people who know they\'re sick, and go into work," said Alan A. Robb, president of the longshore union\'s Gulf Coast district office, in Texas. "They can\'t afford to miss a day."There are certain elements to longshore work that pose an inherent risk for workers, most acutely their daily hiring events, where workers bid for a job on one of the ships coming into port that day.On an early December night in Savannah, Georgia, when it was a brisk 46 degrees, over 500 workers gathered outside the city\'s union hall shortly after dusk for a chance to work an overnight shift on one of the vessels docking at port.Workers, in order of seniority, were squeezed into marked-off areas shoulder to shoulder. Many wore masks, sometimes slipping off, as workers reached over one another to hand a foreman their union card to get selected onto a crew for the night.Barry Griffin, a longshoreman who runs the daily hiring in Savannah, said he tries to hold the events outside to protect from the virus, but if it gets too cold, or the weather is unpleasant it could be moved inside. "I make a game-time decision," he said. Jackie Robinson, the longshore union\'s local president in Savannah, contracted the virus this year and recovered. His wife died from the virus.And in Houston -- one of the country\'s largest ports, where at least three longshoremen have died, according to union officials -- Robb remembers in the early summer how one worker, whom he called a "social butterfly," tested positive for the virus, prompting a crisis as his office tried to track down and isolate every person that man had came into contact with throughout the day."This is one guy who tested positive that literally almost shut the Houston waterfront down," he said. "That could happen anywhere. That\'s the nightmare scenario."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': 'b743b217469e1b83a5d80aae11386683', 'title': 'Blue State or Red, Pandemic Upends Public Services and Jobs', 'description': 'The coronavirus pandemic has inflicted an economic battering on state and local governments, shrinking tax receipts by hundreds of billions of dollars. Now devastating budget cuts loom, threatening to cripple public services and pare workforces far beyond the 1.3 million jobs lost in eight months.Governors, mayors and county executives have pleaded for federal aid before the end of the year. Congressional Republicans have scorned such assistance, with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, calling it a "blue-state bailout."But it turns out this budget crisis is colorblind. Six of the seven states that are expected to suffer the biggest revenue declines over the next two years are red -- states led by Republican governors and won by President Donald Trump this year, according to a report from Moody\'s Analytics.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThose on the front lines agree. "I don\'t think it\'s a red-state, blue-state issue," said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. The National Governors Association\'s top officials -- Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., and Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. -- issued a statement this fall saying, "This is a national problem, and it demands a bipartisan and national solution."Efforts to forge a new stimulus bill gained momentum this week with a $900 billion proposal -- offered by a bipartisan group of legislators and endorsed by Democratic leaders -- that includes $160 billion for state, local and tribal governments. While short of plugging the widening fiscal gaps, such a sum would provide welcome relief. But the Republican leadership shows no sign of coming around on state and local aid.In reality, the degree of financial distress turns less on which party controls a statehouse or a city hall than on the number of COVID-19 cases, the kinds of businesses undergirding a state\'s economy and its tax structure.Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota, Republican-led states that depend on energy-related taxes, have been walloped by the sharp decline in oil prices. Places where tourism provides a large infusion of revenues, like Florida and Nevada, face revenue declines of 10% or more, as does Louisiana, which relies on both tourism and energy.Elsewhere, the steep falloff in sales and income taxes -- which on average account for roughly two-thirds of a state\'s revenue, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts -- is forcing Republican and Democratic officials to consider laying off police officers, reducing childhood vaccinations and closing libraries, parks and drug treatment centers.Even the most optimistic assumptions about the course of the pandemic point to fiscal consequences for states and local governments that "would be the worst since the Great Depression" and take years to dig out of, Dan White, director of fiscal policy research at Moody\'s Analytics, concluded.The squeeze at the state level reverberates in urban, suburban and rural counties in nearly every corner of the United States, and officials are making piercing choices.In Casper, Wyoming, someone from the district attorney\'s office walks around the block to the Circuit Court building each week and fetches a large plastic garbage bag full of discarded paper clips to reuse.The brief journey is just one way that the prosecutor, Dan Itzen, is cutting costs. He has also stopped prosecuting 17 types of misdemeanors -- including assault and battery, first-time drunken driving, shoplifting, check fraud and property damage."Something had to give," said Itzen, who handles about one-third of Wyoming\'s criminal caseload and gets his funding from the state. "If I\'m losing personnel, I cannot continue to prosecute as many cases."In Kansas City, Missouri, with a municipal budget of $1.7 billion, the city manager has asked each department to draft a plan for cuts of more than 11%. That could mean laying off 200 police officers from the 1,300-member force and 180 firefighters and emergency medical technicians, said Dan Fowler, a City Council member."This is one of the things that keeps me up at night," Fowler said, thinking about the effect on the city\'s half a million residents. Such cuts could end up closing one or two police stations, even though crime is rising, he said.Emergency response times are already slow, Fowler said, so even though he lives near a hospital, "if I have a heart attack, I\'ll just crawl over there."From collecting garbage to issuing building permits, maintaining parks to fixing potholes, "everything\'s going to slow down because we\'re not going to have the people to do it," he explained. A traffic study of a street in his district with a heavy accident toll has been delayed.In New Orleans, Democratic city leaders are going through a similarly painful process, shrinking next fiscal year\'s general fund by $92 million, down to $634 million.To avoid layoffs, the city is cutting the pay of higher-level employees by 10% and requiring most other employees, including police officers, firefighters and emergency responders, to take 26 unpaid furlough days -- one every two weeks -- next year. The move amounts to a 10% pay cut and comes on top of six furlough days imposed on the city\'s roughly 4,000 employees through the end of this year.On any given day, that will mean fewer people available to drive buses, respond to emergency calls or pick up trash."We are at the marrow," said Gilbert Montaño, the city\'s chief administrative officer. Every agency on average took a 21% cut on top of what they were already facing.New Orleans, like most cities and localities, spends the bulk of its budget on its employees, which makes it nearly impossible to reduce spending without reducing the hours that people work.State and local employees make up roughly 13% of the nation\'s workforce. For women and Black workers, in particular, the public sector has historically offered more opportunities than the private sector for a stable income and reliable benefits."These are folks that are providing essential public services every single day, risking their lives," said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, "and now there\'s a good possibility that many are going to be faced with a pink slip."So far, an overwhelming majority of state and local job losses have been in education. Though many of the layoffs have been characterized as temporary, educators and parents worry that they could become permanent. In a new survey of mayors, 45% said they expected "dramatic" cuts for their school budgets.Public schools overwhelmingly rely on property taxes. States often provide additional funding, but many have cut their education budgets.Most states managed to hobble along until the summer, a typical endpoint to the fiscal year. There had been strong growth before the pandemic struck in March, and the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which Congress passed in early spring, kept many households afloat. In spots, the extra federal money could be used to cover some state and local pandemic-related expenses in health care and education.Both of those cushions are fading. In most places, the 2020-21 fiscal year will play out in the shadow of the pandemic and a stumbling economy. And federal emergency money for extended unemployment benefits that has helped families meet housing and food expenses expires at the end of December, putting even greater demand on public services.Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, and many economists have warned that reducing state and local spending will further drag down a weak recovery, as it did after the Great Recession. Spending by state and local governments accounted for about 15% of the nation\'s economic activity, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of the Commerce Department.While the federal government can run budget deficits to cover both regular and unexpected expenses, states generally cannot.In Wyoming, Mark Gordon, the Republican governor, acknowledged the fallout on the economy after announcing a new round of cuts for the coming fiscal year. He said 160 private-sector jobs depended on every 100 state employees, who spend money on haircuts, children\'s sports and restaurants.Although Wyoming is facing one of the worst budget shocks, it also has one of the biggest rainy-day funds, which states built up after the last recession to help weather downturns. Several states -- including Louisiana, Nevada, New York and Illinois -- have little or nothing left in reserve.Even so, Wyoming\'s governor has said he doesn\'t want to burn through the state\'s safety net with years of hard times potentially lying ahead. The fund may also be needed to plug an additional $300 million deficit related to the state\'s public schools. So Gordon has proposed cutting programs dealing with childhood vaccinations, substance abuse and mental health.Meg Wiehe, deputy executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said Wyoming at least was dealing with the painful reality."The bigger kind of cuts that will resonate with people are all going to come to a head in the early part of next year," Wiehe said. "We\'re staring down some deep and very devastating cuts."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Anthony Fauci said on Sunday he “would have no hesitancy whatsoever” in taking the vaccine that was authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Saturday evening. “The good news, it’s a single shot,” Fauci told NBC’s Meet the Press. The J&J vaccine also can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures, instead of needing deep cooling like the already-approved Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Johnson & Johnson efficacy rates appear lower than the other two, however top experts are telling the public not to worry. “You can understand that type of a concern, but in order to really compare vaccines, you have to compare them head to head. And these were not compared head to head,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the White House coronavirus adviser, told CNN’s State of the Union. He further talked up the vaccine to NBC. “If you look at the efficacy against severe disease greater than 85%, there have been no hospitalization or deaths in multiple countries, even in countries that have the variants,” he said. “All three of them are really quite good, and people should take the one that’s most available to them. People need to get vaccinated as quickly and as expeditiously as possible, and if I would go to a place where they had J&J, I would have no hesitancy whatsoever to take it.” Fauci also echoed earlier warnings from Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that it was too soon to be relaxing coronavirus restrictions. Several states have eased mask rules and are reopening some businesses, and rates of new infections and mortality have plateaued after recent drops. “Once you start pulling back, the thing you don’t want is to have a plateauing at a level that’s so high that, inevitably, things are going to go back up,” he told NBC. “Our baseline of daily infections now, even though it’s way down from where it was 300,000-plus per day, is down to around 70,000. That baseline’s too high. So it’s really too premature right now to be pulling back too much.” He also responded to growing calls for schools to reopen, cautioning it could be “earliest the end of the year and very likely the first quarter of 2022” before elementary school-age children could be vaccinated. High schoolers, he said, could start receiving shots in the fall.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

A retiree was fetching an online order for her side gig delivering groceries. A 25-year-old manager was at the front of the store, as always, happy to help. Then, for the second time in less than a week, another workaday American scene was shattered by a gunman’s deadly rampage — this one more than 1,000 miles from Atlanta, where families of the eight people killed in another shooting incident are still planning funerals. By the time it was over, 10 people were dead, including a Boulder police officer and at least three King Soopers employees. And people across Colorado, a state scarred by the legacy of the 1999 Columbine High School attacks and a barrage of other mass shootings, wondered in grief and fury how it had happened again, in their state, their college town of Boulder, their neighborhood supermarket. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It’s overwhelming,” said Frank DeAngelis, the former principal of Columbine High School, whose phone rings so often after new mass shootings that he has become the state’s grief-counselor-in-chief. “Colorado’s been through so much.” Law-enforcement officials said the 21-year-old suspect, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, had been armed with a handgun and military-style semi-automatic rifle and was wearing an armored vest when he carried out the attacks. In a detailed affidavit, investigators said the gunman began the rampage in the store’s parking lot, then pushed inside. Officer Eric Talley, 51, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder Police Department, was the first officer to reach the scene. Officers who swept into the store soon after found him with a bullet wound to the head and dragged his lifeless body back outside. The authorities identified the nine additional victims as Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Teri Leiker, 51; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65. Relatives and friends reached for celestial metaphors to describe the victims Tuesday, calling one woman a comet flaring across the sky and another a beam of light. Chief Maris Herold of the Boulder Police struggled to hold back her grief at a news conference in which she hailed Talley as “heroic” in his final call as a police officer. King Soopers workers said their slain colleagues had diligently worked on the front lines throughout the pandemic only to find themselves in the cross hairs of America’s relentless plague of mass shootings. Maggie Montoya, a pharmacy technician, was helping with coronavirus vaccinations when gunshots boomed through the aisles at about 2:40 p.m. Monday. A bullet cut down one of the patients who had been waiting in line. “Active shooter!” screamed a manager, and the workers and customers scrambled for their lives. As the gunshots drew closer to the room where Montoya, 25, and a colleague huddled together in hiding, she said she stopped trying to dial 911 and instead called her parents. “I wanted to hear their voice, for them to hear my voice in case it was the last time,” she said in an interview Tuesday. Alissa, who was shot and wounded in his leg, was charged with 10 counts of murder and was booked into the Boulder County Jail on Tuesday after being released from the hospital. He faces a possible penalty of life in prison without the chance of parole if he is convicted. Colorado abolished the death penalty last year. Law-enforcement officials did not offer a motive for the attacks, and said they were just beginning to sift through a sprawling crime scene and unravel Alissa’s past and his actions in the days leading up to the attack. Court records show he was born in Syria in 1999, his birth date happening to land just three days before the Columbine attacks in Littleton, Colorado. Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney, said Alissa had lived “most of his life in the United States.” Two classmates from Arvada West High School, where he had been on the wrestling team and graduated in 2018, said he had a short temper and anger problems. They recalled an incident in which Alissa punched another student during school. The Arvada Police Department said that Alissa had been convicted of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, in 2018 for a November 2017 incident in which Alissa “cold cocked” another student during class, then punched him in the head several more times. Alissa said the classmate had called him “racial names” weeks earlier, Arvada records show. He was also arrested on a criminal mischief charge in 2018. Brooke Campbell, 20, who managed the high school wrestling team while Alissa was on it, said he would get angry after losing wrestling matches or at seemingly unimportant things. “It’s scary, you know, looking back — that you knew someone that was capable of those things, or is now,” she said. “It kind of makes me sick.” Posts on the suspect’s now-deactivated Facebook page referenced wrestling, his martial arts achievements and Islam. In 2019, he shared a post that referred to passages from the Quran about the importance of being humble, kind and restraining anger, saying that the lessons were “What Islam is really about.” Another post from 2019 said simply, “#NeedAGirlfriend.” His brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, 34, told CNN that the suspect had grown increasingly paranoid starting around 2014 and believed he was being followed, chased or investigated. He once covered his computer’s camera with duct tape to keep from being spied on, his brother said. Family members did not respond to several messages seeking comment. According to an arrest affidavit from the Boulder police, Ahmad Alissa bought a Ruger AR-556 pistol on March 16 — the same day as the mass shootings at three massage parlors around Atlanta and just six days before the police say Alissa stormed into the supermarket. The gun is a short-barreled variant of an AR-15 carbine that is marketed as a pistol. A woman married to one of Ahmad Alissa’s brothers told investigators that she had seen the suspect playing with what she described as “a machine gun” two days before the attack at King Soopers, according to the affidavit. It was unclear whether she was describing any of the weapons used in the attack. The shooting touched off anguished new cries for tougher gun laws that reverberated Tuesday from Colorado, where Democratic lawmakers are pushing for a five-day waiting period on gun purchases, to the White House. President Joe Biden, saying he and the first lady were “devastated” by the attacks, made a new call to impose laws banning assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines. “This is not and should not be a partisan issue — it is an American issue,” Biden said. “We have to act.” The shootings in Boulder, which appear to be the deadliest in Boulder County’s history, cut a deep gash across Colorado communities that have been jolted again and again by sickeningly familiar active-shooter alerts. Since Columbine, there have been deadly public shootings at multiple high schools, a movie theater in Aurora, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. And on and on. Colorado politicians talked Tuesday about how they had shopped at the market that was now a bloody crime scene, or personally known a victim. They struggled to describe the grief and outrage of confronting a mass shooting in their backyard just six days after the shootings in Atlanta. “Flags had barely been raised back to full mast after the tragic shooting in Atlanta that claimed eight lives, and now a tragedy here, close to home, at a grocery store that could be any of our neighborhood grocery stores,” Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, said at a news conference. State Rep. Tom Sullivan, whose son, Alex, was among the 12 people killed in the Aurora theater attack in 2012, said the Boulder shooting demonstrated the urgency of passing new gun-control measures. The state Legislature is considering bills that would require guns to be locked or secured in houses with children, and to require gun owners to report any lost or stolen guns to the police. Sullivan is also pushing for Colorado to pass a five-day waiting period on gun purchases. “I know what last night was like,” he said, referring to the long wait before some families learn they will never be reunited with their loved ones. Across Boulder, the shoppers and workers who barely escaped the gunfire said they were still raw and numb and could barely begin to grieve. Kimberly Moore, 35, a pharmacy technician, said the gunman’s rampage ended not far from the room where she and her co-workers were hiding. For a half-hour, she said, they stayed as quiet as they could, hoping that their face masks muffled the sound of their breathing. Moore said she could hear the gunman firing what sounded like two deliberate shots into people: Bang bang. Bang bang. “You’re sitting there, completely exposed, listening to him kill everyone you know,” she said. Deb Grojean, a victims’ advocate with the Boulder Police Department who spent hours with witnesses Monday night, said one woman who survived the attack had recently moved from Dallas to Colorado in hopes of finding a safer place to live. The woman told Grojean that she and two other employees hid upstairs in a storage closet. “We think it’s inconceivable that this could happen in Boulder, but it’s proof it could happen anywhere,” Grojean said, and then asked a question swirling like the snow that crept over the mountains late Tuesday. “When is enough, enough?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said individuals fully inoculated against COVID-19 can meet in small groups with other vaccinated people, in private settings such as homes, without wearing masks. “So what does this mean? If you and a friend or you and a family member are both vaccinated, you can have dinner together. You can visit your grandparents, if they have been vaccinated and you have been too.” She defined “fully vaccinated” as those who are two weeks past their second Pfizer or Moderna shot or Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine. Walensky also said fully vaccinated people can visit a single household of unvaccinated people without wearing masks if those not vaccinated are considered low-risk. Those fully vaccinated, however, should still wear masks when visiting unvaccinated people from multiple households. And they should continue with other precautions, such as avoiding medium- and large-sized in-person gatherings. "I think l important to realize as we\'re working through this that still over 90 percent of the population is not yet vaccinated, and that is our responsibility to make sure, in the context of 60,000 new cases a day, that we protect those who remain unvaccinated and remain vulnerable.” The recommendations come as about 30 million people, or 9.2% of the U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated. Millions more have had their first shot. As vaccinations accelerate to a record 2.2 million shots per day, cases and death continued to decline last week. Despite the positive trends, health officials have warned that the country could see a resurgence in cases as more infectious variants of the virus have been found in nearly every state.

The nominations of Gen. Jacqueline D. Van Ovost of the Air Force to head the Transportation Command, which oversees the military’s sprawling global transportation network, and of Lt. Gen. Laura J. Richardson of the Army to head the Southern Command, which oversees military activities in Latin America, now advance to the Senate, where they are expected to be approved. The unusual strategy to delay the officers’ promotions — intended to protect their accomplished careers — was devised last fall by Mark Esper, the defense secretary at the time, and Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times They both thought the two generals were exceptional officers deserving of the commands. But under Trump, they worried that any candidates other than white men for jobs mostly held by white men might run into resistance once their nominations reached the White House. Esper and Milley feared that if they even broached the women’s names, Trump and some of his top aides would replace them with their own candidates before leaving office. So the Pentagon officials delayed their recommendations until after the election in November, betting that if Biden won, then he and his aides would be more supportive of the picks than Trump, who had feuded with Esper and Milley and had a history of disparaging women. They stuck to the plan even after Trump fired Esper six days after the election. “They were chosen because they were the best officers for the jobs, and I didn’t want their promotions derailed because someone in the Trump White House saw that I recommended them or thought DOD was playing politics,” Esper, referring to the Department of Defense, said in an interview with The New York Times, which first reported the strategy last month. “This was not the case,” Esper added. “They were the best qualified. We were doing the right thing.” The strategy paid off Saturday, when the Pentagon announced in separate afternoon statements and in Twitter messages from its press secretary, John Kirby, that Biden had endorsed the generals’ promotions and that the White House was formally submitting them to the Senate for approval. The disclosure last month that the Pentagon senior leadership had held back the nominations to protect the careers of the two officers from Trump prompted a lively debate in military journals and on social media. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who left the military last summer after his own entanglement with the White House, argued in the national security blog Lawfare that Esper and Milley should have fought it out with Trump. “Upholding good order and discipline within the military does not mean dodging difficult debates with the commander in chief,” Vindman wrote. But defenders of Esper and Milley’s strategy say that Vindman’s argument ignores the civil-military crisis between Trump and the senior Pentagon leaders in the fall. Trump, furious that they had stood up to him when he wanted to use active-duty troops to battle Black Lives Matter protesters, was openly disparaging of Esper to his aides and to the public. Trump was also countermanding the Pentagon at seemingly every turn, especially on social issues. When Milley and senior Army officials sought to set up a commission to look into renaming bases that were named after Confederate generals, Trump took to Twitter, vowing that “my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations.” Lloyd J. Austin III, the new defense secretary, declined last month to comment on the lengths to which Esper and Milley went to ensure that Van Ovost and Richardson received their command assignments. “I would just say that I’ve seen the records of both of these women,” he said. “They are outstanding.” Promotions for the military’s top generals and admirals are decided months before they take over their new positions. So the delay in formally submitting the two officers’ promotions should not affect when they start their new jobs, most likely this summer, Pentagon and congressional officials said. Van Ovost is a four-star officer, leading the Air Force’s Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. Of the 43 four-star generals and admirals in the U.S. military, she is the only woman. Richardson is the three-star commander of the Army component of the Pentagon’s Northern Command, based in San Antonio, which is playing an important role in providing military assistance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s coronavirus vaccination program.

Since schools shut their doors in March, an early warning system that monitors students’ mental health episodes has sent more than 3,100 alerts to district officials, raising alarms about suicidal thoughts, possible self-harm or cries for care. By December, 18 students had taken their own lives. The spate of student suicides in and around Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County district, the nation’s fifth largest, toward bringing students back as quickly as possible. This month, the school board gave the green light to phase in the return of some elementary school grades and groups of struggling students even as greater Las Vegas continues to post huge numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Superintendents across the nation are weighing the benefit of in-person education against the cost of public health, watching teachers and staff become sick and, in some cases, die, but also seeing the psychological and academic toll that school closings are having on children nearly a year in. The risk of student suicides has quietly stirred many district leaders, leading some, like the state superintendent in Arizona, to cite that fear in public pleas to help mitigate the virus’s spread. In Clark County, it forced the superintendent’s hand. “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the COVID numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, Clark County superintendent. “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope.” Adolescent suicide during the pandemic cannot conclusively be linked to school closures; national data on suicides in 2020 have yet to be compiled. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed an increase in the percentage of youth emergency room visits for mental health reasons during the pandemic. The actual number of those visits fell, although researchers noted that many people were avoiding hospitals that were dealing with the crush of coronavirus patients. And a compilation of emergency calls in more than 40 states among all age groups showed increased numbers related to mental health. Even in normal circumstances, suicides are impulsive, unpredictable and difficult to ascribe to specific causes. The pandemic has created conditions unlike anything mental health professionals have seen before, making causation more difficult to determine. But Greta Massetti, who studies the effects of violence and trauma on children at the CDC, said there was “definitely reason to be concerned because it makes conceptual sense.” Millions of children had relied on schools for mental health services that have now been restricted, she noted. In Clark County, 18 suicides over nine months of closure is double the nine the district had the entire previous year, Jara said. One student left a note saying he had nothing to look forward to. The youngest student he has lost to suicide was 9. “I feel responsible,” Jara said. “They’re all my kids.” Over the summer, as former President Donald Trump was trying to strong-arm schools into reopening, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, then the CDC director, warned that a rise in adolescent suicides would be one of the “substantial public health negative consequences” of school closings. Mental health groups and researchers released reports and resources to help schools, which provide counseling and other intervention services, reach students virtually. Mental health advocacy groups warned that the student demographics at the most risk for mental health declines before the pandemic — such as Black and LGBTQ students — were among those most marginalized by the school closures. But given the politically charged atmosphere this past summer, many of those warnings were dismissed as scare tactics. Parents of students who have taken their lives say connecting suicide to school closings became almost taboo. A video that Brad Hunstable made in April, two days after he buried his 12-year-old son, Hayden, in their hometown, Aledo, Texas, went viral after he proclaimed, “My son died from the coronavirus.” But, he added, “not in the way you think.” In a recent interview, Hunstable spoke of the challenges his son faced during the lockdown — he missed friends and football, and had become consumed by the video game Fortnite. He hanged himself four days before his 13th birthday. Hayden’s story is the subject of a short documentary, “Almost 13,” Hunstable’s video has more than 86,000 views on YouTube, and an organization created in his son’s name has drawn attention from parents across the country, clearly striking a chord. “I wasn’t trying to make a political statement,” Hunstable said. “I was trying to help save lives.” This fall, when most school districts decided not to reopen, more parents began to speak out. The parents of a 14-year-old boy in Maryland who killed himself in October described how their son “gave up” after his district decided not to return in the fall. In December, an 11-year-old boy in Sacramento shot himself during his Zoom class. Weeks later, the father of a teenager in Maine attributed his son’s suicide to the isolation of the pandemic. “We knew he was upset because he was no longer able to participate in his school activities, football,” Jay Smith told a local television station. “We never guessed it was this bad.” President Joe Biden has laid out a robust plan to speed vaccinations, expand coronavirus testing and spend billions of dollars to help districts reopen most of their schools in his first 100 days in office. By then, children in districts like Clark County, with more than 300,000 students, will have been out of school for more than a year. “Every day, it feels like we have run out time,” Jara said. Heading into the pandemic, youth suicide rates had been on the rise for a decade; by 2018, suicide had become the second-leading cause of death for youth and young adults, behind accidents. And the most recent behavioral risk survey, which was released last year by the CDC and tracks health trends of high school students, showed a steady rise over the last decade in the percentage of students who said they felt persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, as well as in those who planned and tried suicide. Since the lockdowns, districts are reporting suicide clusters, Massetti of the CDC said, and many said they were struggling to connect students with services. “Without in-person instruction, there is a gap that is right now being unfilled,” she said. Suzie Button, senior clinical director for high school programming at the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit based in New York that works on suicide prevention, said hundreds of schools and colleges — including Clark County’s — are teaming up with the organization to create services to offer students during the pandemic. “There’s a lot we don’t know, but what we do know about schools is they are the nexus of adolescent life,” Button said. “And in times like this, young people are sometimes the canaries in the coal mine.” Like many school districts, the Clark County school system marshaled its resources to plug gaps in services to its students. Truancy officers started doing wellness checks, school psychologists were working overtime, teachers were trained to look for trauma cues on screens, and school resource officers became the chief liaisons between the district and the coroner’s office. By July, after the sixth suicide since March, the district invested in a program, the GoGuardian Beacon alert system, to send reports of mild to severe suicide risk. The system, which scans student writings on district-issued iPads, generated more than 3,100 alerts from June to October, indicating behavior such as suicide research, self-harm, written comments, or just the need for help or support. By November, the deluge forced the district to upgrade its contract to include 24-hour monitoring and a service that would sort out the most severe cases, like students who were in “active planning,” meaning they had identified a methodology and were ready to act. “I couldn’t sleep with my phone nearby anymore,” Jara said. “It was like a 24-hour reminder that we need to get our schools open.” Recent graduates have also been affected. Anthony Orr, 18, drove his car to a parking lot in August and shot himself with an AR-15 he had bought two weeks before. In the months since, his parents, Marc and Pamela, have looked for signs they may have missed. His father did not know anything was wrong until he found his son’s body in the car, grabbed his arm and asked, “Son, what have you done?” The teenager, whose brother is a teacher in the district, seemed happy — he had graduated a couple of months before, decided that he wanted to take up a trade instead of going to college, and was settling in at his new job, where he had made friends. The only disappointment he had expressed was that his senior year was disrupted and that prom and his sports seasons were canceled. But he had met his goal to graduate with advanced honors, and he wore a white gown to a socially distanced, scaled-back ceremony that noted the achievement. “That was a letdown for him, too. There wasn’t the pomp and circumstance,” his father said. “They did it nice, they got to run across the stage and get the paper, but it definitely took away from the party.” His mother, Pamela, did not know whether quarantine pushed him over the edge, but she said: “Our kids are feeling hopeless. They’re feeling like there’s no future for them. I can’t see how there’s any other explanation.” In November, school officials intervened when a 12-year-old student searched his district-issued iPad for “how to make a noose.” The boy’s grandfather, whom The New York Times is identifying by his first name, Larry, to protect the boy’s identity, said the episode was a shock. The boy’s father had retired to bed around 7 p.m. to rest for his 2 a.m. work shift. He did not hear the phone ringing until around 10 p.m., when the school district finally reached him. His father made it to his son’s room to find a noose from multiple shoestrings around his neck. “If there wasn’t a security device that triggers that kind of alert, we would not be having this discussion,” his grandfather said. “It absolutely consumes you.” His grandson, whose dog died during the pandemic, was doing well academically in virtual school but was “Zoomed out,” Larry said. The only indication the boy has given for what pushed him over the edge is saying repeatedly, “I miss my friends.” “He is having a hard time functioning in this isolation,” his grandfather said. “It goes against everything that he is. There has to be an option of letting these kids go to school.” A dozen schools in the district began a pilot program to allow for face-to-face counseling. Recently, the number of schools swelled to 68. The program has led to interventions in 30 cases where students were considering suicide. The pilot has “grown into a monster,” said John Anzalone, principal at one of the initial 12 schools, Sierra Vista High School. He knew that his diverse, largely working-class student population, whose families have suffered from Las Vegas’ tourism crash, would be hit hard by the virus. But he was still stunned by the effect. “These young people are having to grow up really, really fast,” he said. “Some were alone even before the pandemic because their parents were working, and some are the breadwinners now.” Adrienne, mother of a 14-year-old high school freshman, had just finished a 12-hour shift last month when she received a call from her son’s principal, alerting her that her son had expressed suicidal thoughts. The teenager had told a friend that if they called the police, he would “do it.” “He felt disconnected,” his mother said. “He felt left behind.” His father had lost his small business. Two family members had died, one to the coronavirus. His mother was working 70 hours a week. Even when she was at home, she was not entirely present, as she tended to work and home life. “He just felt like he had no control over his world anymore and felt like a burden,” Adrienne said. “He loves to help people, to make people laugh, and he feels like he’s failing.” Indeed, its student failure rate, ranging from 60% to 70%, is another crisis at the school. That, in turn, is depressing the teachers and staff. The district is conducting a survey to see what supports it needs to provide its employees. Colleen Neely, a counselor at Shadow Ridge High School, recalled how a young man she had advised since ninth grade used to stand outside her office every day after fourth period. He had overcome so much by the 2019-20 school year in his determination to graduate: When he was junior, he was homeless, and the school connected him to a shelter; for a week, he lived in a park near the school, and staff gave him food and other resources; his schedule was shortened so he could work at McDonald’s. In the spring of 2020, Neely sent the young man an email telling him how proud she was of him, that he was so close to getting what he wanted. Two weeks before graduation, she got the call that he had shot himself. “Part of me will always wonder if he’d had access to his teachers, and his peers, and me, if it would’ve changed the outcome,” Neely said through tears. “I will never know. These suicides, they don’t impact one person and one family. They impact me to this day.” Jara understood. “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” he confessed. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 3}

On Lindell’s “Vocl” social media platform, users will be free to claim that a supercomputer stole the election from Donald Trump, or that vaccines are a tool of the devil.Any new social media network faces serious challenges. But Vocl must grapple with a daunting problem before it even launches: a website called “Vocal,” spelled with an “A,” already exists.On Thursday, lawyers for Vocal’s publicly traded parent company, Creatd, Inc., warned Lindell, in a letter reviewed by The Daily Beast, to change his social media network’s name and surrender ownership of the Vocl.com domain name. If Lindell refuses to change the name, he could face a lawsuit.While Lindell has promised to turn Vocl into a “cross between Twitter and YouTube,” Vocal is a publishing platform similar to Medium where writers can post and monetize articles.“It is clear that you are acting with bad faith and with intent to profit from Creatd’s mark,” the letter reads, claiming Lindell’s Vocl would “tarnish” the Vocal brand.“It’s not like anything you’ve ever seen,” Lindell previously told Insider, describing his similarly named social network. “It’s all about being able to be vocal again and not to be walking on eggshells.”Creatd owns the trademark for using “Vocal” in a number of ways related to social networking, including creating “virtual communities” and “online networking services.” Along with surrendering ownership of the Vocl.com domain name, Creatd wants Lindell to destroy any products with Vocl branding and never use the name again.“Creatd is prepared to take all steps necessary to protect Creatd’s valuable intellectual property rights, without further notice to you,” the letter reads.When asked on Friday morning about the new legal warning, the embattled MyPillow CEO and Trump friend replied, “It has nothing to do with their trademark. I haven't even launched yet. But it has nothing to do with us.”Lindell claims Vocl is also an acronym.“Ours stands for the ‘Victory of Christ's Love,’” Lindell added.Dominion Says It Will Sue MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell Over Election Fraud Claims Early Friday afternoon, he called back to say, “We looked into it, and we believe it would be confusing, so we are going to announce a different name and URL by Monday.”Lindell is already facing one major lawsuit. In February, voting-tech company Voting Systems sued Lindell and MyPillow over his baseless allegations that Dominion was involved in a scandalous election theft. Concurrently, Lindell, with the help of Trump attorney and Gawker-slayer Charles Harder, has also recently sued the Daily Mail tabloid, over the publication’s January article that the Trump pal had a “secret romance” with 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star Jane Krakowski, a story that both parties have flatly denied.For years, the pillow mogul has been a personal friend of former President Donald Trump, and a diehard MAGA supporter and campaigner. During the 2020 presidential election, Lindell served as Trump 2020’s Minnesota co-chair, and following Trump’s loss in the Electoral-College and popular vote to Democrat Joe Biden, the MyPillow CEO became one of the loudest voices in the country supporting the broader Trump effort to nullify the outcome of the presidential race. (Trump’s anti-democratic crusade on this, of course, climaxed with his instigation of the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, an event that led to the ex-president’s second impeachment in the House.)During the tumultuous presidential transition period, Lindell was a major behind-the-scenes funder of several efforts to challenge the 2020 results, and near the very end of Trump’s term even visited the then-president at the White House to brief him on discredited documents alleging that China and other foreign nations helped hack the election and throw it to Biden. Ever since the start of the Biden era, Lindell has not given up aggressively promoting the fiction that Trump actually won, even as it has resulted in his banishment from certain social media platforms, his business getting shunned by other companies, and ballooning legal risk.Alternative social media networks aimed at conservatives have been challenged by hacks and other technical issues, but Lindell claims Vocl won’t face those problems. Hackers recently hit far-right social network Gab, while social media platform Parler went offline for a month after the U.S. Capitol riot when Amazon Web Services pulled support for its hosting. In contrast, Lindell told Insider that Vocl will have its own servers, with “space-age stuff” to prevent hacking.Lindell told Insider that Vocl has a staff of roughly 10 people, but declined to describe them or where they’re working “for their safety.”Vocl users will be free to promote conspiracy theories about election fraud and vaccines, according to a speech Lindell gave Wednesday at a rally in Arizona.“Every word out of their mouths is going to say Dominion, Smartmatic fraud, vaccine fraud,” Lindell told the cheering crowd, describing the content on Vocl.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Porsa, the CEO of Harris Health System, which treats thousands of mostly uninsured patients, warned Friday that its entire vaccine supply could be depleted by midday Saturday. The problem is not one of capability — the vaccination centers he oversees have easily been administering as many as 2,000 vaccines a day — but of availability. “All of a sudden the distribution of vaccines stopped,” Porsa said. “It’s perplexing and frustrating because I keep hearing that there are high percentages of vaccines that have been distributed but not administered.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times In the midst of one of the deadliest phases of the pandemic in the United States, health officials in Texas and around the country are growing desperate, unable to get clear answers as to why the long-anticipated vaccines are suddenly in short supply. Inoculation sites are canceling thousands of appointments in one state after another as the nation’s vaccines roll out through a bewildering patchwork of distribution networks, with local officials uncertain about what supplies they will have in hand. In South Carolina, one hospital in the city of Beaufort had to cancel 6,000 vaccine appointments after it received only 450 of the doses it expected. In Hawaii, a Maui hospital canceled 5,000 first-dose appointments and put 15,000 additional requests for appointments on hold. In San Francisco, the public health department had at one point expected to run out of vaccines this past week because the city’s allocation dropped sharply from a week ago and California officials temporarily had to put thousands of doses on hold after a higher than usual number of possible allergic reactions were reported. In New York state, officials in Erie County have canceled thousands of vaccine appointments in recent days after a sharp decline in allocations from the state. The situation is especially dire in Texas, which is averaging about 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day, fueling concerns over whether officials will be able to curb the spread when they cannot get their hands on the vaccines they desperately need to do so. Health officials trying to piece together why this is happening are puzzled by reports that millions of available doses are going unused. As of Friday morning, nearly 39.9 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had been distributed to state and local governments, but only about 19.1 million doses had been administered to patients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pfizer and Moderna have each agreed to provide the United States with 100 million vaccine doses, and the companies are racing to manufacture the vaccines, together releasing between 12 million and 18 million doses a week. At that rate, it is feasible for the new administration to meet President Joe Biden’s pledge to inject 100 million vaccines by his 100th day in office. Public health officials could even potentially ramp up the pace of vaccinations with existing supply. It appears that problems with distributing the already available doses are responsible for many of the acute vaccine shortages now being seen in parts of the country. Factor in the ever-increasing demand as more states make the vaccine widely available to those 65 and older, and officials warn that distribution headaches could persist in the weeks ahead. The Biden administration has pledged to overhaul distribution to the states and even use the Defense Production Act to increase supply, but vaccine experts warn that shortages of the doses will persist in the short term with manufacturing sites already facing capacity constraints. State and local governments, as well as hospital administrators, are fending for themselves. In Houston, Porsa said his staff was scrambling as the supply of vaccines dwindled this past week, squeezing six doses out of vials intended to provide five. In one sign of the confusion around vaccine distribution in Texas, officials in Dallas County scrapped a plan that would have prioritized shots for people living in heavily Black and Latino communities hit hardest by the virus. Texas state officials threatened to slash allocations of the vaccine if the county went ahead with the plan even though data showed that most of the shots administered in Dallas County had been in wealthier neighborhoods. Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, is now struggling with a similar problem as the hospitals serving some of its poorest residents run out of the vaccine, prompting some public health experts to question why doses are not being made more available to vulnerable communities. “These are our front-line workers who are at the greatest risk of contracting the virus and at the greatest risk of spreading it to others,” said Vivian Ho, a health economist at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine. “We would be able to resolve the pandemic in Harris County quicker if we could get a sufficient number of vaccines,” she added, referring to the county encompassing much of Houston. Adding to the turmoil, just days after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, praised the state’s vaccine rollout at a meeting in Houston where Democratic city and county officials were excluded from participating, the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, also a Republican, sent a letter Thursday to the state’s Expert Vaccination Allocation Panel urging its members to fix the problems. “Right now, in many cities and counties when an announcement of available vaccinations is made, website sign-up pages crash and phone calls go unanswered,” Patrick said in the letter. “Texans need to have a better understanding of the time it will take for everyone to be vaccinated in order to reduce lines, confusion and frustration.” The sense of chaos afflicting the distribution efforts, not just in Texas but in an array of states, is laying bare how local officials are struggling to fill the void left by the lack, until this week, of a comprehensive response at the federal level. Dr. George Rutherford, a public health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, said the most obvious problem with vaccine administration in the San Francisco area was clear. “There’s not enough doses, period,” he said. “That’s it. Everything would work fine if you had enough doses.” The public health department in San Francisco and hospitals in the city were “caught by surprise” by the lack of doses, Rutherford said, and by the eligibility expansion to those 65 and older, which likely strained the system. Varying vaccine distribution channels — such as Kaiser Permanente and UC San Francisco — receive the doses on their own, he said, further complicating an already convoluted distribution system. “So it’s a little hard for the city to understand exactly what’s left over, what they need to do, where the holes are to fill,” Rutherford said. Still, new vaccination sites are opening in San Francisco, which Rutherford said would help speed the process along once more doses become available. “There’s this tension between efficiency and equity,” he said. “It’s never easy.” Dr. Grant Colfax, head of the San Francisco Department of Health, said the city was “very close to doses running out” and said a lack of overall coordination has led to distribution problems. “I think what this really is, is a continuation of the fallout of the lack of a coordinated federal response,” he said. “Basically cities and counties were left on our own to deal with this pandemic.” He said local jurisdictions “simply did not have the resources and the capacity” to handle the complicated effort without help. “It has manifested in a very tragic way.” In Austin, Texas, Curt Fisher, a 76-year-old who has served on the boards of several high-tech startups, experienced firsthand the confounding roadblocks to securing a vaccine. He was playing golf with friends several weeks ago when they learned that Austin Public Health had vaccines available. They quickly registered with their cellphones from the golf course and landed appointments in a matter of minutes. The system was deluged, and Fisher, who had waited about 30 minutes to call, missed out. He doggedly checked the website from his home about four or five times a day for more than three weeks. Each attempt bore the same result: no vaccines available within the maximum 100-mile search radius. Then after days of pinning his hopes on his hometown health service, good fortune finally came from more than 150 miles away. He received a text from a Memorial Hermann hospital in Houston, where he was automatically registered because he had seen a doctor about three months earlier, inviting him to come to the hospital for his first dose of the vaccine. He made the roughly three-hour drive Monday, spending about an hour at the hospital with little waiting for his first shot of the vaccine. He is supposed to go back Feb. 8 for the second and final injection. Looking back, Fisher said the success he found in Houston and the hassles he went through in Austin illustrated that some vaccine distribution centers “really have their act together” and others do not. “I don’t think the system that Austin Health had could handle the stress of the high volume, obviously,” he said. But some people have struggled to get vaccine appointments, only to see them canceled because of supply problems. Jeanelle Fernandes, 33, who has sickle cell anemia and lives in Miami, initially felt relieved after setting up a vaccine appointment for Jan. 28. Having it confirmed “was kind of like a light at the end of the tunnel,” she said. “This has been a really hard journey for me.” But then Baptist Health South Florida tweeted this week that all first-dose vaccine appointments scheduled for Jan. 20 or later would be canceled. “I’m definitely frustrated,” she said. It was not the hospital’s fault, she said; she blamed a government that seemed unprepared to roll out millions of vaccine doses when people urgently needed them. “Now I have to wait,” Fernandes said. “I’m up in the air. I don’t know what’s going to happen.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The total price tag looks to come in at around $900 billion. Left out, as far as we know, will be funding for cash-strapped state and local governments, a worrying sign that Republicans are bent on returning to their pre-Trump commitment to pointless austerity now that Democrat Joe Biden is headed to the White House.Something is certainly better than nothing. But long, contentious negotiations resulting in de facto austerity for millions of Americans, looming bankruptcies and service cuts for states and cities, and impunity for companies willfully endangering their employees are a dispiriting harbinger of the endless gridlock to come should Republicans hold the Senate. Instead of Democrats setting the agenda in Washington, the key player will remain Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who will have no conceivable reason to compromise or play fair. Why should he? He\'s been playing the same ruthless game for more than a decade now, and voters keep giving the gavel back to him.While it will help some weather the months of misery to come, the deal represents a catastrophic strategic failure for Democrats. Throughout the fall, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) refused to take up a similar but larger $1.8 trillion package on offer from the White House. While there were legitimate doubts about whether it had any chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate (or if President Trump\'s White House would honor an agreement), the real holdup was Pelosi\'s not unreasonable belief that Democrats were about to sweep into power in the Senate and increase their House advantage. That obviously didn\'t happen, although the upper chamber is still in play. Holding out for more money and for McConnell to fold on his insistence on shielding companies from liability if they endanger the lives of their workers, Pelosi in the end looks like she might get neither.Pelosi, of course, was hardly the only person in D.C. who thought Republicans were going to get dismissed with prejudice from government on November 3rd. More than anything, these rancorous stimulus negotiations are a terrifying preview of post-pandemic life under divided government if Democrats fail to sweep the Georgia Senate runoffs on January 5th. If you thought the last six years of the Obama administration were fun — non-stop budget standoffs, fiscal cliff brinksmanship, government shutdowns, and the deliberate muzzling of the post-Great Recession recovery — you\'ll love the coming showdowns between the Biden administration and an emboldened Republican Senate.After years of feeding paper into the money printer, letting it go whirr, and reaping the political benefits of what the outgoing president constantly called "the greatest economy in history," Senate Republicans will now do everything in their power to bring it all crashing down around them. Their relentless obsession with deficits, which they had conveniently left back in the Obama era along with their concern about dead Americans and the "McConnell Rule" about Supreme Court appointments in an election year, will return with a vengeance. They will use the opportunity of the economic recession to put pressure on states and municipalities to slash spending and services, and to continue hollowing out the capacity of the public sector. Like Obama, Biden will suffer politically from the slow recovery inflicted on him by Republican obstruction.Amazingly, Biden is still running around telling reporters he thinks he can change this. Just this week he predicted that "...as Donald Trump\'s shadow fades away, you\'re going to see an awful lot of change." After six to eight months, Biden claimed, the Republicans who keep telling him in private that they will work with him will come around.Six to eight months? What exactly will be happening in the interim, especially if Biden also believes there are strict limits on his executive power? Why is he still talking about winning Republicans over, instead of defeating them? He\'s the one who carried Georgia, and he should stay camped out there for the next month trying to bring a Democratic Senate across the line. Retire the happy talk and give it to the voters straight: It\'s either us, or it\'s two years of unbearable paralysis.Maybe Biden felt like he needed to indulge these delusions to get elected president. But the belief that his Republican counterparts are basically decent people whose fevers will break once the pathogen of Donald Trump exits the body politic was part of the problem all along. It convinced too many people that the only problem was Trump and not the political party that spent four years covering up his crimes and abuses and then actively joining his assault on American democracy and decency. It failed to tie the administration\'s catastrophic COVID mismanagement to the congressional GOP\'s sycophantic obeisance to Trump\'s laziness, ineptitude, and indifference to widespread misery.The reward for that blind trust in the goodness of Republicans, cultivated by Biden and other Democrats who chose to turn the Democratic National Convention into an advertisement for Republican defectors, was for the GOP to turn right around and endorse the president\'s sordid plot against the republic. Last week, 126 Republican members of the House endorsed the preposterous plan to have GOP state legislators appoint their own slate of electors, and to hand the election to the man who lost it. Even if the lot of them knew that this attempted coup was doomed to fail in court, it will go down as one of the most shameful episodes in modern American history.It wasn\'t just the famously reactionary House GOP either. A number of Senate Republicans were in on the conspiracy, including Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah). The runner-up in the 2016 Republican primary, Ted Cruz (R-Texas) offered to argue these ridiculous cases before the Supreme Court. Does Biden think that a few months after trying to literally overthrow the duly elected government of the United States, these same senators are going to have such a huge change of heart that they will agree to work with him for the good of the people? I hope Biden keeps a large supply of hot sauce and some Himalayan sea salt on hand, because when he eats those words he\'ll need help getting them down.Given the dire circumstances facing millions of Americans, though, and the long-shot nature of winning both Georgia runoffs, Democrats are making the right call to compromise on a stimulus package. If McConnell retains his Senate majority, there will likely be no help at all for anyone, and that\'s too big a risk to take.For restaurateurs and other business owners whose bottom lines are dependent on the long-lost face-to-face contact of the Before Times, this could be the difference between a long winter of slowly going broke, and surviving until the vaccine makes in-person gatherings safe again sometime in the spring. And while $600 per person (the rumored number for direct payments) is woefully inadequate to the task of repairing the vast economic damage wrought by the pandemic and the federal government\'s embarrassing failure to address it, putting cash directly into people\'s pockets helped avert the worst when COVID-19 first washed up on these shores.It\'s worth trying again, even if it\'s not enough. Of course, with negotiations ongoing, we could still end up with no deal at all, or perhaps an agreement in which Democrats get more. But if they don\'t like this already tiresome dynamic, Biden and his allies need to make the Georgia runoffs the focus of their political lives, or else resign themselves to another term for McConnell\'s informal presidency.More stories from theweek.com  The plan to disinfect the White House before Biden moves in is a \'huge waste of time and effort,\' experts say  Report: Of the hundreds of people invited to Mike Pompeo\'s indoor holiday party, a few dozen showed up  Joe Biden still doesn\'t get it', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Twenty-six of the people received pardons, and three got commuted sentences. Manafort and Stone, a longtime Trump political confidant, were convicted as part of the federal investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort was sentenced to seven years for bank and tax fraud, and other crimes. He was released to home confinement in May due to coronavirus concerns. Stone was charged with lying to Congress, but Trump commuted his 40-month sentence in July. Charles Kushner, Jared Kushner\'s father, served two years for tax fraud and witness tampering. [NPR, The New York Times] 2.President Trump on Wednesday followed through on his vow to veto the annual defense bill, saying it "would put the interests of Washington, D.C., establishment over those of the American people." Trump also criticized a provision in the bill that would let the military remove the names of Confederate leaders from military bases. The Senate and the House approved the legislation with veto-proof bipartisan majorities, signaling that Congress could respond by overriding Trump for the first time in his presidency. In anticipation of the veto, lawmakers are scheduled to return from holiday break and meet next week to vote and potentially override Trump. "I would hope we would be able to override the veto," Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said last weekend. [The Washington Post, The New York Times] 3.Pfizer on Wednesday agreed to provide the United States with another 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech. The deal, reached after negotiations with the Trump administration, will double the U.S. order, providing enough of the two-dose vaccine for 100 million people. The federal government will pay $1.95 billion for the extra supply. The doses will be delivered by July. The deal won\'t increase the number of people who will get the Pfizer vaccine in the next few months, but it will help prevent a shortage come summer. Pfizer and Moderna, which also has started shipping its vaccine, will supply the government with a combined 400 million doses, enough for 200 million Americans. So far, 18.3 million people in the U.S. have been infected with the virus, and nearly 324,000 have died. [The Washington Post] 4.Republicans scrambled on Wednesday to salvage the $900 billion coronavirus relief package after President Trump slammed it as a "disgrace" filled with spending unrelated to the pandemic and demanded that lawmakers increase stimulus checks to individuals from $600 to $2,000. Trump\'s suggestion that he would not sign the legislation without revisions threw its future in doubt as many Americans stand to lose extra pandemic-related unemployment benefits this week. The relief package also is tied to a $1.4 trillion spending deal needed to avert a government shutdown. Congressional Democrats, who tried for months to push through a multi-trillion dollar relief package, are calling Trump\'s bluff and moving Thursday, Christmas Eve, to propose a stand-alone bill to provide $2,000 stimulus checks. [The New York Times] 5.Attorney General William Barr ended his final day on the job with a farewell note saying "it has been a great honor to serve once again in this role." Barr first held the job under President George H.W. Bush. Barr thanked the "dedicated" staff of the department and said they "have risen to meet historic challenges and uphold our vital mission to enforce the rule of law." Barr was long considered one of President Trump\'s closest allies, but a rift seemingly grew between the two in recent weeks after Barr didn\'t buy into Trump\'s efforts to overturn the presidential election. Trump announced this month that Barr would be leaving. His departure comes as Trump continues to push Republicans to somehow reverse his election defeat weeks ahead of President-elect Joe Biden\'s inauguration. [CBS News, New York Post] 6.The federal government released a flurry of fresh economic data on Wednesday that boosted fears that the economic recovery was faltering as coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths surged. Consumers cut spending last month by 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported. The drop, the first in seven months, came after a burst of shopping over the summer. Spending dropped on services, including restaurant meals, and on goods, including cars, appliances, and other big-ticket items. Household incomes also fell, losing 1.1 percent in their third decline in four months. New applications for unemployment benefits retreated from a three-month high but remained elevated. The Labor Department reported that 803,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, down from a revised 892,000 the prior week. [The Wall Street Journal] 7.A provincial court in Pakistan on Thursday ordered the release of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the man convicted in 2002 as the mastermind of the kidnapping and murder of The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The Sindh High Court in Karachi set aside Sheikh\'s death sentence in April, and downgraded his conviction from terrorism, kidnapping, and murder to the lesser crime of kidnapping. That carries a maximum sentence of seven years, so Sheikh, who had served 18 years, was eligible for release. The same court overturned the convictions of three accomplices who had been sentenced to life in prison. Pearl\'s family is appealing Sheikh\'s acquittal on the murder charge. Pakistani authorities had used emergency detention powers to keep Sheikh and the three others in prison. [The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal] 8.Gunmen attacked a village in the western Benishangul-Gumuz region of Ethiopia on Wednesday, killing more than 100 people, the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said. The area has been plagued with ethnic violence. Several ethnic groups live in the region, including the Gumuz people. In recent years, some Gomuz have complained that farmers and businessmen who have moved in from the neighboring Amhara region have taken fertile land. Some Amhara leaders claim the land rightfully belongs to them. Ethiopia, Africa\'s second most populous country, has been plagued by violence in other areas since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was appointed in 2018 and intensified a push for democratic reforms. [Reuters] 9.Columbus, Ohio, Mayor Andrew Ginther on Wednesday called for the firing of police officer Adam Coy, who fatally shot an unarmed Black man, Andre Hill, on Tuesday. City Council President Shannon Hardin called for Coy to be arrested, calling Hill\'s death an "unjustified killing." Coy, who is white, responded to a non-emergency call about a man sitting inside a car, repeatedly turning it on and off. Body-camera footage showed that Coy shot Hill, 47, less than 10 seconds into the encounter, and that several minutes elapsed before an officer and the female officer with him rendered aid. Coy failed to activate his body camera before the shooting, but a "look back" feature recorded video with no audio of the 60 seconds before it was activated. Coy already is facing disciplinary charges that could lead to his firing. [Columbus Dispatch, NPR] 10.The NBA postponed the Houston Rockets\' Wednesday season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder because the Rockets lacked the eight available players required by the basketball league. The team was left shorthanded after three players returned positive or inconclusive coronavirus tests, and four others were quarantined under the NBA\'s contact tracing protocol. Another player, Chris Clemons, was not available due to injury, and Rockets star James Harden was "unavailable due to a violation of the Health and Safety Protocol" based on a video, published by Black Sports Online, showing him maskless at a Houston club, the league said. Harden also was fined $50,000. Houston\'s next scheduled game is Saturday against the Portland Trail Blazers.

Giuliani did not wear a mask during meetings last week in Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia, exposing lawmakers and others to the virus.During an interview with New York radio station 77 WABC, the hosts asked Giuliani if his views on the virus have changed, now that he is sick and in the hospital. They mentioned former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who contracted the virus after attending a super spreader event at the White House; Christie later said it was "wrong" to be there without a mask."No," Giuliani responded. "I have exactly the same view. You know, I\'ve also been through cancer, a couple of other things — very serious, very serious, emergency knee operation. Things happen in life, and you have to go with them. You can\'t overreact to them. Otherwise, you let the fear of illness drive your entire life." Regarding face coverings, which provide protection to the wearer and those around them, Giuliani said he thinks "you can overdo the masks."Giuliani revealed that he has received two of the same medications Trump took during his hospitalization for COVID-19: remdesivir and dexamethasone. One of the radio hosts told Giuliani the drugs are "not something that the normal American is going to be able to get, because it\'s quite expensive." Giuliani deflected, saying he "didn\'t know that. I mean, they give it to us here at the hospital."He did admit that his high profile is why he is receiving treatment that the average American can\'t get, saying, "I think if it wasn\'t me, I wouldn\'t have been put in the hospital. Sometimes, when you\'re — you know, when you\'re a celebrity — they\'re worried if something happens to you, they\'re going to examine it more carefully, and they do everything right."

The federal government has even given more than $500 million dollars to expedite the process as part of its Operation Warp Speed initiative to get vaccines and other COVID treatments to market, The New York Times reports. Trump also posted another video on Twitter on Oct. 8, alluding to the success of Regeneron and telling seniors they\'d be able to get it for free soon. But what do we actually know about the experimental treatment that is still in clinical trials? Read on to get the facts you should know about the drug Trump claims cured him. And for more on the drugs doctors gave the president, These Are All the COVID Treatments Trump Has Tried. 1 It\'s a combination of two antibodies.REGN-COV2 is "a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (REGN10933 and REGN10987) and was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19," according to a statement released from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on Sept. 29. The two antibodies essentially bind to the coronavirus\' spike protein, which inhibits it from mutating. And for more on the treatments doctors administered to the president, check out The Harrowing Side Effects of Trump\'s COVID Treatment. 2 It is likely effective at reducing COVID-19 symptoms.While clinical trials in humans are still ongoing, preliminary results indicate that the treatment reduced "viral load and shortened symptomatic disease in patients" who did not already have COVID-19 antibodies, according to an article in the journal Science. In addition, trials have not yielded any evidence of serious health risks regardless of the dosage level. The president was given eight milligrams, which is considered to be a high dose. 3 But there\'s no evidence it prevents COVID-19.According to the same statement issued from Regeneron, there are ongoing "studies of REGN-COV2 for the treatment of hospitalized patients, and for prevention of infection in people who have been exposed to COVID-19 patients," but no evidence of the drug\'s efficacy at preventing COVID infection currently exists. And for another recent development regarding the coronavirus, This Is the Connection Between Pink Eye and COVID-19. 4 The drug has been submitted for emergency FDA approval.According to reporting from The New York Times, Regeneron submitted the antibody cocktail for emergency approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Oct. 7. The move came shortly after the president praised the drugmaker\'s experimental cocktail as an alleged cure for COVID-19. However, medical experts agree that there is no evidence to indicate that the product is solely responsible for Trump\'s self-claimed recovery. "There is zero evidence that he is \'cured,\' and even if he\'s getting better, there is nothing to prove it was (or wasn\'t) the Regeneron treatment," Megan Ranney, MD, an associate professor of emergency medicine and public health at Brown University, told The New\xa0Republic.If approved, the drugmaker stated that the treatment would initially be available on a limited basis, with only enough doses for about 50,000 patients.

Pfizer and BioNTech also applied for emergency authorization for their jointly-developed vaccine on November 20."We believe that our vaccine will provide a new and powerful tool that may change the course of this pandemic and help prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.

Nora Carol Photography/Getty ImagesThe Internal Revenue Service has postponed the April 15 tax filing deadline to May 17. If taxpayers need even more time to file federal returns, the agency added, they can request an extension until Oct. 15. “This continues to be a tough time for many people, and the IRS wants to continue to do everything possible to help taxpayers navigate the unusual circumstances related to the pandemic, while also working on important tax administration responsibilities,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. The announcement may come as welcome news for many Americans, but it also raises an important question: Why should taxpayers have to navigate the tedious, costly tax filing system at all? The case for a ‘simple return’ In 1985, President Ronald Reagan promised a “return-free” tax system in which half of all Americans would never fill out a tax return again. Under the framework, taxpayers with simple returns would automatically receive a refund or a letter detailing any tax owed. Taxpayers with more complicated returns would use the system in place today. In 2006, President Barack Obama’s chief economist, Austan Goolsbee, premiered the “simple return,” where taxpayers would receive already completed tax forms for their review or correction. Goolsbee estimated his system would save taxpayers more than US$2 billion a year in tax preparation fees. Though never implemented, the two proposals illustrate what we all know: No one enjoys filling out tax forms. So why do we have to? A costly and time-consuming system Return-free filing is not difficult. At least 30 countries permit return-free filing, including Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, 95% of American taxpayers receive more than 30 types of information returns that let the government know their exact income. These information returns give the government everything it needs in order to fill out most taxpayers’ returns. The U.S. system is 10 times more expensive than tax systems in 36 other countries with robust economies. But those costs vanish in a return-free system, as would the 2.6 billion hours Americans spend on tax preparation each year. Maybe you’re wondering whether Congress is just behind the times, unaware that it can release us from tax preparation? Not true. As an expert on the U.S. tax system, I see America’s costly and time-consuming tax reporting system as a consequence of its relationship with the commercial tax preparation industry, which lobbies Congress to maintain the status quo. The United Kingdom is among dozens of countries that permit return-free filing for some taxpayers. Loop Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Commercial tax preparation Almost 20 years ago, Congress directed the IRS to provide low-income taxpayers with free tax preparation. The agency responded in 2002 with “Free File,” a public-private partnership between the government and the tax preparation industry. As part of the deal, the IRS agreed to not compete with the private sector in the free tax preparation market. In 2007, the House of Representatives rejected legislation to provide free, government tax preparation. And in 2019, Congress tried to legally bar the IRS from ever providing free online tax preparation services. Only a public outcry turned the tide. The public part of Free File consists of the IRS herding taxpayers to commercial tax preparation websites. The private part consists of those commercial entities diverting taxpayers toward costly alternatives. According to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which oversees IRS activities, private partners use computer code to hide the free websites and take unsuspecting taxpayers to paid sites. Should a taxpayer discover a free preparation alternative, the private preparers impose various restrictions such as income or the use of various forms as an excuse to kick taxpayers back to paid preparation. Consequently, of the more than 100 million taxpayers eligible for free help, 35% end up paying for tax preparation and 60% never even visit the free websites. Instead of 70% of Americans receiving free tax preparation, commercial companies whittle that percentage down to 3%. Tax savings and evasion Perhaps you are guessing that there are valid policy justifications for avoiding government and empowering the private sector. Judge those arguments yourself. One argument from commercial tax preparers is that taxpayers will miss out on valuable tax savings if they rely on free government preparation. In fact, the government software would reflect the same laws used by the paid preparers with the same access to tax saving deductions or credits. Further, tax preparers like H & R Block promise to pay all taxes and interest resulting from a failed audit. As a result, these services have every incentive to take conservative, pro-government tax positions. A second argument is that government-prepared tax returns encourage tax evasion. In a no-return system, the government reveals its knowledge of the taxpayer’s income before the taxpayer files. Thus, the argument goes, the taxpayer knows if the government has missed something and has reason to let the mistake stand. But taxpayers already know what information forms the government has because they receive duplicates of those forms. The incentive to lie does not increase because the taxpayer avoids weeks of tax preparation. [You’re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation’s authors and editors. You can get our highlights each weekend.] Bolstering the anti-taxers Finally, there is the anti-tax argument for onerous tax preparation: Keep tax preparation unpleasant to fuel anti-tax sentiment. In the past, Republicans argued against high taxes. But after decades of tax cuts, Americans are no longer swayed by that argument. Exasperating tax preparation, according to this argument, helps keep the anti-tax fever high. And that fuels public hate for government and the tax system. Unfortunately, the anti-tax contingent’s desire to force Americans to spend time and money on tax preparation dovetails with the tax preparation industry’s desire to collect billions of dollars in fees. Tax preparation companies lobby Congress to keep tax preparation costly and complicated. Indeed, Intuit, maker of TurboTax, the tax preparation software, lists government tax preparation as a threat to its business model. One example is the earned income tax credit, a government program for low-income people. The credit is so complicated that 20% of the people who are eligible never file. If the government prepared people’s tax returns, that 20% would receive government support. Nonetheless, Intuit has lobbied lawmakers to make the credit more complicated, thereby driving more taxpayers to paid preparation services. To date, the tax preparation industry has kept the system complicated because the potential cost to it in terms of lost revenue is vast. Only public outcry can change the system.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

The new round of stimulus checks will cost about $140 billion, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) told MSNBC, meaning the cost is roughly on par with the $160 billion in aid to state and local governments that had been proposed as part of a $908 billion compromise framework put forth by a bipartisan group of lawmakers.Republicans have pressed to keep the cost of any additional Covid aid below $1 trillion. Democrats said that that while the package leaves out funding for state and local governments, it would still deliver aid to states in other ways.Timing still in question: The progress comes after congressional leaders met in person Tuesday and continued their talks Wednesday as they race to finalize the coronavirus package and a $1.4 trillion federal spending bill before current government funding expires on Friday.“We made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief package that would be able to pass both chambers with bipartisan majorities,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday morning in a speech on the Senate floor. “We committed to continuing these urgent discussions until there’s an agreement. And we agreed we should not leave town until we’ve made law.”But negotiators were still haggling over various details of the plan. One reported sticking point is a Democratic push to increase the Federal Emergency Management Agency matching rate for Covid-19 disasters from 90% to 100%, according to Bloomberg News. Democrats say the change would cost $1 billion, but Republicans say it would cost $90 billion, based on the proposed legislative language, and object to what they see as an attempt to funnel more money to state and local governments.While the House could still vote on a deal as soon as Thursday, the timeline could slip, requiring a Senate vote over the weekend — and, potentially, another short-term extension of federal funding to avoid a partial government shutdown after midnight on Friday. "If we don’t get done by Friday night, I don’t want to shut down government," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said, according to Politico. "If we need three or four more days, we’ll take the time that’s necessary."The politics at play: Both sides have plenty of incentive to finalize a deal before they head home — and election politics are still part of the equation. McConnell reportedly told Republican senators on a call Wednesday that passing a relief deal will help GOP Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia as they head for January 5 runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. In campaigning for Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock on Tuesday, President-elect Joe Biden said he needs “two senators from this state who want to get something done, not two senators who are just going to get in the way.”More signs the economy needs help: U.S. retail sales fell 1.1% in November, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, marking the first drop since the spring. “Economists said the decline was a ‘warning sign’ that the economy was entering a rough patch and in need of a jolt from another round of government stimulus,” The New York Times reports.Nearly 8 million Americans have fallen into poverty since June, according to data released Wednesday by researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame, driving the poverty rate up 2.4 percentage points to 11.7%. And newly released Census Bureau survey data from late November and early December show that 85.4 million American adults, or 35.6%, report having trouble paying for basics such as food, medicine and rent, up from 76.5 million, or 31.9%, in early September.What it all means: A deal now appears all but certain. The price tag being discussed amounts to nearly double what Republicans had proposed but far less that the $2 trillion or more that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had sought for months. Still, while the cost of the package has come down, it would still be the second largest emergency spending package in U.S. history, behind only the CARES Act passed in March. And lawmakers are expected to renew their debates on state and aid a liability shield in the new year.Biden reiterated Wednesday that more aid will be needed. “The stimulus package is encouraging. Looks like they’re very, very close and it looks like there are going to be direct cash payments,” he told reporters. “But it’s a down payment, an important down payment on what’s going to have to be done at the end of January, the beginning of February.”Like what you\'re reading?

{'_id': '56d3d472dc89cd98b5afb283f558d240', 'title': 'How West Virginia Became a U.S. Leader in Vaccine Rollout', 'description': 'CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Carolyn Zain had heard horror stories about the nation’s coronavirus vaccine rollout: long waits, clunky websites, people being turned away. So when her health department announced it was expanding appointments, she armed herself with two phones — cellphone in one hand, landline in the other — and held her breath. Within 20 minutes, she secured a slot for the next day. She arrived for her 2 p.m. appointment and was resting in a chair, a fresh shot in her arm, by 2:21 p.m. “It went wonderfully,” said Zain, 79, who, after a year spent mostly home alone, wore a sequined face mask that shimmered like confetti for her appointment at a Charleston clinic last week. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Since the nation began distributing vaccines more than a month ago, it has moved far more slowly than officials hoped and has been stymied by widespread logistical problems. But West Virginia has stood out for its success in getting people vaccinated. About 9% of all West Virginians have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, a larger segment than in every state but Alaska and double the rate of some. No state has given a larger share of its residents second doses, a crucial step to securing the best chance at immunity. While many states are struggling to hand out the shots that the federal government has provided to them, West Virginia has given out 83% of its doses, by far among the highest. The patchwork system of distribution in the country is in its early weeks, and experts say operations may change significantly as vaccinations gear up further, but many states have struggled to give even half of their allotted vaccines. California and Rhode Island have used just 45% of their shots. “West Virginia is about at the top of the charts,” said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We need to get more states to the point that they have the vaccination capacity of West Virginia.” As many states struggle with logistical and bureaucratic challenges, leaving vaccines unused, West Virginia offers a remarkable example of a state that has successfully given out almost all of its shots. Yet it provides perhaps the clearest picture of a more fundamental problem that looms ahead for the country: Even the most efficient state vaccine operations do not have enough shots for all who want them. “It’s not like it’s a cakewalk, but we have efficiency,” said Dr. Clay Marsh, the state coronavirus czar. He estimated that West Virginia has the capacity to handle 125,000 doses a week, but is getting just 23,600. At the current pace, officials said, it could take up to five months to finish vaccinating people 65 and older, let alone younger people in the general population. “We can push a lot more,” Marsh said. “We just don’t have anything to push.” The race to vaccinate millions of Americans comes as the country confronts worrying new variants of the virus. The stakes are particularly high in West Virginia, where residents are among the oldest and least healthy in the nation. Two in 10 West Virginians are 65 or older, and nearly half of adults have a higher risk of developing a serious case of COVID-19. “People are dying every day,” said Albert L. Wright Jr., CEO of WVU Medicine, the state’s largest health care provider, which opened a mega-clinic in Morgantown last week. “We just realized, the only way out of this is to vaccinate our way out.” While the rollout in West Virginia has not been without its frustrations for the many residents who are desperate to receive the vaccine, the state’s approach offers insight into what has worked. Early on, the state got a significant head start because it initially opted out of a federal program to vaccinate people in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. While other states chose the federal plan, which partnered with Walgreens and CVS to inoculate people in nursing homes around the country, officials decided the idea made little sense in West Virginia, where many communities are tucked into the hills, miles from the nearest big box store, and about half of pharmacies are independently owned. West Virginia created a network of pharmacies in the state, pairing them with about 200 long-term care facilities. As a result, West Virginia finished its first round of vaccinations at nursing homes last month, while many states were just getting started. By the end of this week, officials expect to have delivered a second round of shots to all nursing homes. A growing number of governors and state health officials have voiced frustration with the speed of the federal program, which has been slow in part because of the sheer number of long-term care facilities nationwide. Some states, like Maine, have also begun looking to local pharmacies as a resource. “Using your local partners and really having more control over where the vaccine is going, that’s what has been successful for West Virginia,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. The approach in some ways reflects the scrappy outlook that has become embedded in West Virginia, a state that is used to being labeled in broad strokes by outsiders. After years of coming in at the bottom of various national rankings — highest rate of cigarette smokers, largest share of adults with multiple chronic conditions, among the highest prevalence of diabetes and obesity — there is a sense of proud defiance around the state’s vaccine plan. “Our state motto is montani semper liberi — mountaineers are always free,” said Stephen New, a lawyer in Beckley, whose father, a former coal miner, is scheduled to get vaccinated at a local clinic this week. “There is a fierce sense of independence here that we don’t need to follow others.” Central to West Virginia’s strategy, too, is putting the National Guard at the helm of vaccine operations. “They are logistical experts,” said Jim Kranz, a vice president at the West Virginia Hospital Association, who described a military approach far different than typical government bureaucracies jammed up by memos and lengthy meetings. “The Guard just says, ‘I don’t need a written plan, this is what we’re doing.’ ” In recent weeks, other states have increasingly been turning to the National Guard for assistance. Inside a former drill hall on the National Guard’s gated campus in Charleston, a core state team of representatives from various agencies meets at a command center, working amid a labyrinth of computer screens, whiteboards and plexiglass dividers, in the shadow of an enormous American flag. Officials in West Virginia say the in-person command center, which runs counter to pandemic-era Zoom meetings and may come with health risks, has also helped quickly resolve problems. For instance, a recent brainstorming meeting led to a swift change: To avoid a mix-up between Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, officials changed the colors of cards showing that a resident had been vaccinated — red for Moderna, blue for Pfizer. “It’s a person at a table,” said Joe Peal, a retired colonel and the chief of staff for the vaccine task force. “We absolutely could not do it virtually.” Officials say they have also learned what not to do — including not promising shots that they don’t yet have. After a crowd of people in their 80s unexpectedly showed up outside the health department in Charleston one shivering winter night, officials there decided clinics could not be first-come, first-served. They required appointments, and to avoid later rescinding those appointments, as has happened in states like New York and Florida, appointments are not made until the county officials have that week’s allotment of vaccines on hand, sitting in their own freezer. Some of West Virginia’s success also may partly be explained by characteristics of the state. Its population, 1.8 million people, is tiny compared to states like Texas, which are handling far more vaccines. West Virginia is also among only a handful of states that do not allow philosophical exemptions for vaccines for school, according to the Immunization Action Coalition, suggesting a culture where acceptance of vaccines may be more prevalent. West Virginia’s rollout has by no means been without hiccups. And some of the problems have been similar to those in states with far worse records in distributing shots: Phone lines have been mobbed and many West Virginians have spent hours calling to get appointments without success. The health department in Kanawha County, which includes Charleston, was so overloaded with phone calls last week, its phone system crashed and its Facebook page was flooded with complaints. “I’ve called 250+ times but still unable to get through,” one person wrote. The distribution of vaccines — mainly to health care workers and older residents — also has been concentrated in urban centers, raising concerns about equal access in rural and more impoverished areas. Of the state’s 10 poorest counties, just one had a vaccine clinic in recent weeks, according to an analysis by the nonprofit newsroom Mountain State Spotlight. But the main problem, officials say, is not logistical but a matter of supply: They need more vaccine. Dr. Sherri Young, the health officer in Kanawha County, said one big reason phone lines are overrun is because the county cannot reliably schedule clinics weeks in advance. If there were more vaccine, she said, “people wouldn’t be as panicked.” Pfizer and Moderna have pledged to deliver a combined 200 million doses for use in the United States by the end of March, with an additional 200 million doses to be delivered by the end of July. A third vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, could put millions more doses on the market if approved. West Virginia had hoped to make the case that because it is moving through its vaccines, it deserved to get more, but so far states have been allocated doses based on population. Jim Doria, 69, a retired public health researcher, had gone months without seeing his grandchildren who live in Philadelphia and was eager to be among the first to get vaccinated after the state opened the system to people in his age group last week. He estimated that he called as many as 700 times. “I won the lottery,” he said, after getting off a waitlist. But for every person like Doria, countless others were left disappointed. Statewide, West Virginia has given shots to around 70,000 of its senior citizens, with more than 250,000 left to go.

In a letter co-signed by his counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Professor Chris Whitty told medics "the public will understand and thank us" for administering as many first doses as possible rather than giving people a second jab within the recommended three or four weeks. It came as GPs across the country vowed to defy the Government\'s new strategy, describing it as a "huge gamble". Doctors\' leaders said the decision to cancel appointments for elderly patients due to have their second Pfizer coronavirus vaccination next week was "grossly unfair", encouraging GPs to press ahead with the planned jabs in defiance of the strategy. In a letter to ministers, the Doctors\' Association said there was no evidence that delaying the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine would be effective, suggesting the move "undermined the vaccine programme as a whole". In a joint letter sent to medics, all four of the UK\'s chief medical officers said: "We recognise that the request to reschedule second appointments is operationally very difficult, especially at short notice, and will distress patients who were looking forward to being fully immunised. "Halving the number vaccinated over the next two to three months because of giving two vaccines in quick succession rather than with a delay of 12 weeks does not provide optimal public health impact. We have to follow public health principles and act at speed if we are to beat this pandemic, which is running rampant in our communities, and we believe the public will understand and thank us for this decisive action."

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) showed the drug to be 94 percent effective at preventing COVID-19. What Happened: The large-scale study conducted in Israel found the two-dose vaccine reduced symptomatic cases by 94 percent one week after the second dose and also reduced the severity of the disease by 92 percent, Nikkei Asia reported on Thursday. The results of the study by the Clalit Research Institute and experts from Harvard University and Boston Children’s Hospital were published and peer-reviewed in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, which included more than a million people of whom nearly 600,000 were vaccinated, also showed the vaccine to be effective against the British strain of the coronavirus. Why It Matters: The results are the first from a real-world study and showed the vaccine to be as efficient as in clinical trials, where the vaccine has shown a 95 percent efficacy rate. It also mirrors the results of earlier studies from Israel, which has one of the most efficient inoculation campaigns in the world. Price Action: Shares of Pfizer closed nearly 0.5 percent lower at $33.75 on Thursday, while shares of BioNTech closed almost 2 percent higher at $114.17.

It\'s hard to predict what date everything will go back to normal, however, experts have a good idea of how low the country\'s COVID cases and deaths would have to drop to consider the pandemic behind us, effectively moving into endemic territory where we\'d be able to manage COVID much like we do the flu. To see what numbers mean the country can open up again, read on, and to see what you\'ll be able to do once you get your shot, check out Dr. Fauci Says It\'s Safe for You to Do This Once You\'re Vaccinated. The pandemic will be "over" when the numbers match typical flu numbers. Reaching zero COVID cases is nearly impossible, The Atlantic reports in a new in-depth article. But the next best thing is COVID becoming an endemic disease, one that still lingers in the community at low levels but doesn\'t inflict severe illness often. Once COVID reaches that point, it will be much more manageable. Paul Offit, MD, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told The Atlantic he thinks "the doors will open" when the country sees fewer than 5,000 new cases a day, and fewer than 100 deaths a day.Multiple experts agree with Offit\'s metrics. "Fewer than 100 deaths a day—to mirror the typical mortality of influenza in the U.S. over a typical year—is an appropriate goal," Monica Gandhi, MD, an infectious disease specialist at UC San Francisco, told The Atlantic. While these numbers are far from zero, this risk level is "largely considered acceptable," Joseph Eisenberg, PhD, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, told The Atlantic. And for more up-to-date COVID news delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter. We\'re months away from these numbers. If we\'re measuring ourselves against flu metrics, we have a long way to go before we can call the pandemic a thing of the past. According to the CDC, the country\'s most recent seven-day average was 1,975 deaths a day, as of Feb. 22. That\'s down 36 percent from 3,108 deaths two weeks earlier on Feb. 8. If things continue at this pace, that means it\'d take another 14 weeks, or three and a half months, to get to under 100 deaths a day. At this rate, we\'d reach endemic status in early June, but of course, many factors could come into play that affect that estimate. And for more on our return to normal, check out The CDC Is About to Relax These COVID Restrictions, Dr. Fauci Says. Some experts think these numbers should be even lower. While less than 5,000 new cases a day matches up with the flu\'s average numbers, some experts feel that cases need to drop even lower before we should feel comfortable returning to normal. Crystal Watson, DrPH, a health security scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told The Atlantic that a threshold of 0.5 newly diagnosed cases per 100,000 people per day and a test positivity rate of less than one percent nationwide would be better metrics. Watson noted that to consider ourselves past the pandemic, we should also log at least one month of business as usual at hospitals during which there are no staff or equipment shortages.These more stringent measurements would be even more challenging to reach. The U.S. reported 135.25 new cases per 100,000 people on Feb. 22, according to the CDC, which is down 42 percent from the 233.52 new cases per 100,000 reported two weeks prior on Feb. 8. If new cases continued to decline at that rate, it\'d be 20 weeks—or five months—until COVID reached endemic status, which would put us at mid-July. And for more on life post-vaccination, check out Dr. Fauci Still Won\'t Go to These 3 Places Now That He\'s Vaccinated. The comparison isn\'t perfect, but it\'s the closest we have to predicting the end of COVID. Comparing COVID numbers to flu numbers isn\'t a perfect system since COVID-related deaths are reported to public health authorities, while flu deaths are estimates based on national surveillance data from statistical models, explained The Atlantic. Additionally, considerably more COVID tests are done than flu tests, meaning positive cases are difficult to compare. However, many experts consider measuring COVID against the flu to be the best metric we have for the moment as a predictor of the end of the pandemic.

Not so fast, warn experts. “Things are tenuous. Now is not the time to relax restrictions,” says Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We cannot get comfortable or give in to a false sense of security that the worst of the pandemic is behind us.” So should restrictions be tightened? Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shared his answer with Dana Bash on CNN’s State of the Union. Read on to hear what he said—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus. 1 Dr. Fauci Warned That COVID is Not Over Yet Bash played Fauci Walensky’s quotes from the White House COVID-19 Response Team Briefing on Friday. “I know people are tired. They want to get back to life as normal, but we're not there yet,” Walensky also said. “As you know, Dr. Fauci, many governors across the country are beginning to ease,” said Bash. “Some restrictions that you were just talking about. New York is opening movie theaters, Massachusetts and North Carolina are relaxing capacity restrictions on indoor dining. Is that premature?”“Well, I mean, amen to what Dr. Walensky said,” answered Fauci, “because if you look at the curve”—of cases, he meant—“it's coming down sharply, but the last several days, it's kind of plateaued at around 70,000 new infections per day.” That’s higher than many months last year. Keep reading to see Dr. Fauci’s warning. 2 Dr. Fauci Said We Must Learn From the Rebounds of the Past “Let's look at what history has taught us,” Fauci said. “If you go back and look at the various surges, whenever we hit the peak and start coming down, understandably, totally understandably say, ‘Well, let's pull back.’ We're going to ultimately be pulling back, but you want to get the level of baseline infections day very low. Because if you look at that little plateau, particularly in the arena of having variants, such as we have in California and such as we have in New York, it is really risky to say, ‘It's over, we're on the way out. Let's pull back.’”“Because,” he continued, “what we can see is that we turn up. It isn't hypothetical data because just look historically at the late winter, early spring of 2020 of the summer of 2020, when we started to pull back prematurely, we saw the rebounds.” 3 Dr. Fauci Didn’t Give State by State Guidance But Said Cases Could Rebound “Obviously each individual state and city needs to look at the situation in their own location where they are,” said Fauci. “But in general, to think just because the cases are coming down on a daily basis, take a look at the pattern and just watch over the next several days to a week. If we do this and start coming up, then we're going to go right back to the road of rebounding. So that's the reason why I agree completely with what Dr. Walensky has said.” 4 Dr. Fauci Warned of the New Variants New variants are proving more transmissible, and in some cases, more deadly. “We take them very seriously,” said Fauci. “Two tools you have to address them—continue with the types of mitigations, the public health measures that we talk about all the time.” And the other is to get vaccinated ASAP. “If you prevent that by public health measures and vaccination, you'll dampen the effect of these variants. And that's the reason why we keep saying, keep the public health measures up and get as many people vaccinated as you possibly can.”RELATED: If You Feel This You May Have Already Had COVID Says Dr. Fauci 5 How to Stay Safe During This Pandemic So follow Fauci’s fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live—wear a face mask that fits snugly and is double layered, don’t travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, get vaccinated when it becomes available to you, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

The University of Florida is planning to offer more face-to-face classes than it did before the pandemic. And Princeton University, which let only a few hundred students live on campus last semester, has offered space to thousands of undergraduates.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe determination to bring back more students, even as the pandemic is surging in many states, partly reflects the financial imperative to have more students paying room and board, as well as the desire to provide something resembling a college experience.But there is also an emerging confidence among at least some college administrators that they have learned much about managing the pandemic on their campuses. Test aggressively. Contact-trace assiduously. Maintain mask rules and social distancing. And don\'t underestimate students\' willingness to obey restrictions."What makes me optimistic is, we had the virus in our community, and each time we did, we were able to stop transmissions dead," said David Greene, president of Colby College in Maine, which brought its whole student body back in the fall using aggressive health measures and plans to do the same again next semester.Experts said a major test of whether colleges learned the right lessons would come in January and February, when students travel back to school from home."The disease is a lot more widespread now than it was" in the fall, said Dr. Tom Frieden, who ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration and is now president of a global health initiative to prevent heart disease and epidemics. "When people travel, the virus travels."Since the start of the pandemic, campuses have weighed the financial and social benefits of business as usual against the terrifying risk of COVID-19. Young people are statistically less likely than older adults to become severely ill or die from the infection, but they have turned college towns into COVID-19 hot spots. Schools and the communities around them have also enforced public health rules inconsistently.Many institutions are choosing not to bring back more students, planning instead to hunker down over the winter as infections mount and the nation awaits a vaccine. The University of Michigan, which spent a rocky fall trying to keep thousands of students on campus, has told most of its students to stay home and study remotely next semester. The California State University\'s 23 campuses have concluded that sticking with remote classes is the safest approach for the spring.But other schools, and some experts, are asking: Safe compared to what?"Having students return to campus to live under the imperfect supervision of college administrators is risky," said A. David Paltiel, a professor of health policy and management at the Yale School of Public Health. "But having students stay home to live under the imperfect supervision of their parents and families is also risky."That argument has been particularly compelling for schools that managed the fall with relatively minimal infections -- and the schools that watched and learned from them. Cornell University expects about 19,500 students will be living on or around its Ithaca, New York, campus next semester, more than 80% of enrollment and about 1,500 more students than were there during the fall.Brown will roughly triple and Harvard will about double the number of students in campus housing in the new year. Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, will add about 100 students to the approximately 1,200 who were living on campus in the fall. It also plans to reestablish its study abroad programs, according to a school spokesperson.Students have also proved more conscientious than the public may think, administrators said. The culture of fraternities, big sports and big parties remains a challenge, but at many schools, students themselves reported the majority of health violations."When this started, the premise was that students would not and could not behave responsibly," said Michael Kotlikoff, Cornell University\'s provost. "I think we\'ve proven that this is not so."Many university officials say they are also increasingly confident that the virus is not being transmitted in classrooms, where professors are enforcing mask-wearing and social distancing rules."We have not had a single case that we can trace to a classroom," said Mike Haynie, vice chancellor for strategic initiatives and innovation at Syracuse University. "It happened in communal living situations and in gatherings that took place off campus."Haynie cited a study of 70,000 undergraduates at Indiana University, which found that the more classes a student took in person, the lower the likelihood that student would become infected with the coronavirus."The spread is in teacher break rooms, in fraternities and sororities," Frieden said. "It\'s not even in organized sports, but in locker rooms before and pizza parties after."Syracuse has seen a "significant decrease" in undergraduates signing up for remote learning in the spring, indicating that more will elect to live on campus, said Ellen James Mbuqe, a spokesperson. The university had about 15,000 students on campus this fall and expects the number to grow in the spring.Steven Constable, a geophysicist at UC San Diego\'s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and chair of the school\'s academic senate, said data showing negligible transmission in classrooms had helped bring skeptical university employees on board with the university\'s plan to add some in-person classes."You could argue that our lecture halls are one of the safer places to be in San Diego right now," he said.Instructors at other schools have been a harder sell. At the University of Florida, faculty have filed grievances over the school\'s decision to offer 5,394 sections of face-to-face classes, 72 more than were offered last January, before the pandemic hit the United States. Concerns have persisted even though the school, which offered only optional testing this fall when it invited its 50,000 students back to campus, will expand its testing regimen, requiring that all students living on campus or taking classes in person be tested every two weeks in the spring.Some faculty are also revolting at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The university sent most students home a week after classes began in August because of an outbreak but is now proposing to bring 2,000 students back to campus residence halls on top of 1,500 who were allowed to stay during the fall for hardship reasons. It will also offer about 1 out of 5 classes in person in the spring semester.This month, about 70 faculty members signed an open letter, published in the student newspaper, that predicted a repeat of the fall debacle. "We have every reason to expect that the university will -- once again -- be overwhelmed by infections when classes resume," the letter said.But the university\'s president, Kevin Guskiewicz, said he was confident the university could pull it off. "We\'re working from a different starting place than we were in the fall," he said.The value of aggressive coronavirus testing has been one of the major lessons of the fall. "We changed our testing protocols substantially over the semester," said Michael Fitts, Tulane\'s president. "At one point, we moved it up to three times a week, and we found that was very effective, and we will continue that in the spring."Tulane has access to two testing machines through its medical school, which can conduct 3,000 tests a day and have results back in 12 hours. "I will say our positivity rate was much lower than New Orleans," Fitts said of the university, which calls the city home.Syracuse learned its lesson after Halloween, when the lab it was using produced results too slowly and transmission got out of hand, Haynie said. Now the university has its own testing lab, within the biology department. For the spring, it plans to double its capacity to about 300,000 tests between January and May."We realized we had to have full control and autonomy," Haynie said.Similarly, Cornell University set up a lab in its veterinary school, where it can perform 35,000 to 40,000 tests a week and get results back in as little as eight hours. UC San Diego is processing its own tests, too.UC San Diego is doing not only standard swab testing but also testing wastewater, expanding contact tracing with a phone app and moving instruction to outdoor classrooms. As of Saturday, the school had recorded only about 70 cases since March among the more than 9,000 students living on campus, according to the school dashboard."It\'s like a Swiss cheese model," said Pradeep Khosla, UC San Diego\'s chancellor and an engineer who specializes in system building. "Every layer has its holes, but put together, it\'s a solid block."Most college officials do not expect a vaccine to be available for students in the spring term. But many universities, like the University of Kentucky, are planning to be integrally involved in the distribution of vaccines through their health systems, which will position them for providing it on campus when the time comes.Although a vaccine might seem like the light at the end of the COVID tunnel, it will also pose a new challenge for university administrators, said Crystal Watson, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security."Will they make it mandatory for students, staff and faculty?" she asked. "If not, will vaccination be required for some type of the population but not others? That\'s a big open question."Watson said that however far colleges have come, there is still a large gap between the wish for normalcy and the reality. "Right now it looks so different from what a traditional campus would look like," she said. "The students are getting such a bad deal this year. It really stinks."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Last year suspected North Korean hackers tried to break into at least nine health organisations, including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax Inc, and AstraZeneca. South Korea's intelligence agency said it had foiled North Korean attempts to hack into South Korean companies developing coronavirus vaccines. Digital espionage against health bodies, vaccine scientists and drugmakers has intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic as state-backed hacking groups scramble to obtain the latest research and information about the outbreak. North Korea is often accused of turning to an army of hackers to fill cash-strapped government coffers amid international sanctions that ban most international trade with the country.

AstraZeneca also stressed its 85% efficacy in the over-65s and 100% protection against severe disease and death.Those stats put it in the same ballpark as the other vaccines, an infectious disease expert told Reuters.What's also significant is that the trial of more than 32,000 people came after more infectious variants of the disease became prevalent.  Thursday's revision should go a long way towards U.S. emergency-use authorization for the shot, which AstraZeneca will seek in the coming weeks. And it will help the firm, which developed the vaccine with Oxford University, overcome doubts over effectiveness and side-effects on both sides of the Atlantic.AstraZeneca's vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of COVID-19. It is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots. But questions have dogged the rollout. Earlier this month, more than a dozen countries paused use after reports linked the vaccine to a rare blood-clotting disorder.The EU drug regulator ruled it safe, but many Europeans remain skeptical.Production glitches and export curbs by India and the EU are among other problems that have marred the rollout.Two sources have told Reuters that India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of the shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine-maker.That's to meet domestic demand as infections rise.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

The prisoner swap was done to secure the freedom of a 23-year-old Israeli woman who was arrested for illegally crossing into Syria at the beginning of February. She was exchanged for two shepherds who had crossed the border from Syria. It was initially reported as a straightforward prisoner exchange, before Israeli media learned of an unpublished part of the agreement which had been blocked by the country’s military censor. A source familiar with the negotiations confirmed the reports of the Russian-brokered vaccine deal to the New York Times. While the number of doses Israel has agreed to pay for remains unknown, reporter Barak Ravid and Israeli news site Ynet, reported the deal was for $1.2 million worth of Sputnik V. It is not immediately clear whether the doses are part of Israel’s current vaccine arsenal or will be bought from Russia separately. Syria’s state-run news agency denied the reports that vaccines were part of the deal for the woman to be released, saying it was part of an “attempt to paint Israel as a humane country.” The woman, who cannot be named due to a court order, arrived back in Israel, via Moscow, on Friday. According to the Times of Israel, the deal was initially to release two Syrian residents of the Golan Heights who are imprisoned in Israel, but fell through when one refused to be deported back to Syria. Instead, two shepherds who had crossed the border while herding their flocks were released. On Sunday, Israel’s Army Radio reported that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking at the possibility of trading excess vaccines for diplomatic relations with countries Israel does not currently have ties to, in a bid to improve their diplomatic standing in the world. Eli Gilad, a senior health ministry official, told Bloomberg last week that the country was sitting on almost 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine that it was not planning to put into use because of the amount of Pfizer vaccine Israel has. As poorer countries scramble to get their hands on vaccines, Mr Gilad said the Moderna would “eventually be used”.

Many of those vaccinated were working from home or assigned to non-essential procedures, they said.“First in the room, back of the line,” workers chanted as they marched out of the center on Friday afternoon carrying signs. Videos and photos posted on social media show dozens of scrubs-clad workers walking around the medical facility before congregating at a stairwell.“I saw 16 Covid patients in the last 24 hours...More than Double the amount of residents getting the vaccine,” read one sign held up by a masked medical worker.> Breaking: “First in the room, back of the line.”  > Stanford medical residents and nurses protest what they call unfair distribution of COVID19 vaccines. pic.twitter.com/boDGbKTiBc> > — scott budman (@scottbudman) December 18, 2020“It’s not just about the residents. We stand here to represent our nurses. We are here to back them. Our respiratory therapists, our environmental services workers, food staff, everybody,” one resident said during the protest, before revealing that only two pediatric emergency nurses have been offered vaccines.Another Stanford resident, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation, charged that Stanford is “neglecting” its frontline workers, especially those who are just starting their careers and have been willing to put their lives on the line to provide care during the pandemic. The resident claimed only “about seven residents and fellows” are slated to receive the vaccine in this first round, out of 5,000 available doses. “To put that into context, there are about 1,300 of us,” the resident told The Daily Beast. “That means some medical workers who have been in critical care were passed over while those who have been working from home since the pandemic started will get the vaccine.”“I mean, some medical professionals who are slated to get one of the 5,000 vaccines... haven’t even touched an N-95 mask or treated a COVID-19 patient. It’s absurd,” the resident added.The protesters told The San Francisco Chronicle that the seven who were included in the first round of vaccinations were orthopedic surgeons, nurses treating outpatients, and a dermatologist.On Friday, departments across Stanford’s Medical Center showed their solidarity with the protesting medical workers on social media, and some doctors were reportedly giving up their spots in the vaccination line.Stanford Health Care’s Department of Urology and the chiefs of the internal medicine unit were among those in the medical community who tweeted their dislike for the algorithm Stanford had put in place to determine who would get the vaccine first. Roxana Daneshjou, a dermatologist at Stanford, tweeted that some “attendings...immediately gave up their spots because they didn’t ask to be in the first wave and obviously want the frontline to get it first.”MAGA Fanatic Gym Tycoon Leads Anti-Lockdown Uprising“The Stanford EM Residency program was dismayed by the vaccine allocation process. An algorithm, which was designed to ensure equitable distribution of the first round of vaccines, failed to adequately identify high risk healthcare workers. Although residents were included in the initial pool for consideration, the algorithm let them down and far too few were included in the first round,” Dr. Sara Marie Krzyzaniak, a clinical associate professor for Stanford’s Department of Emergency Medicine, told The Daily Beast.“Our department leadership has worked tirelessly to help right this wrong. Our program has immense gratitude for our residents and is deeply grateful for their work on the frontline caring for our patients,” Krzyzaniak added.The stunning protest elicited a quick response from Stanford’s leadership, including Stanford Health Care CEO David Entwhistle, who reportedly told the assembled crowd: “We’ll correct it.

On Thursday, the state saw 52,000 new cases—more infections than in all of Germany or India—and was battling a positivity rate of almost 12 percent.Complaints of people “cutting” the vaccine line have been growing across the country. Mount Sinai Hospital in New York faced criticism this week for vaccinating an employee in the marketing department before hospital workers who directly interact with COVID-19 patients.And before Friday’s protest, Stanford residents and fellows sent a letter to university leaders in response to the distribution plan, stating that the initial allocation of its over 5,000 obtained Pfizer vaccines was not sufficient.> pic.twitter.com/teU9KPPpIt> > — San Francisco Chronicle (@sfchronicle) December 18, 2020Dr. Earth Hasassri, a child and adolescent psychiatry fellow at Sanford Medical Center, tweeted in response to Stanford’s plan, “Except you forgot about those of us on the front lines: residents and fellows were essentially not included in the first round of vaccines despite working 80+ hours per week in the hospital treating COVID-19 patients.” In the letter to university leaders, employees said there was still “no articulated plan” to vaccinate residents and fellows, and the pecking order didn’t match the exposure level. “It is important for us to articulate to you that at this time, residents are hurt, disappointed, frustrated, angry, and feel a deep sense of distrust towards the hospital administration given the sacrifices we have been making and the promises that were made to us,” they wrote.> Proud of fellow Stanford residents today!

The first one, from Stanford Chief Medical Officer Niraj Sehgal, said it was “clear there were several unintended missteps” and lamented the “perceived lack of priority for residents and fellows,” which Sehgal insisted was not intentional.Another email later in the week from Stanford officials reminded recipients that although frontline workers were denied vaccinations this round, another 15,000 doses are arriving next week. “There are active conversations now to make sure trainees are represented in all the upcoming tiers in a significant way,” the email said.“Disparities in distribution of the vaccine can be seen at a micro-level at Stanford today. I worry that the situation we see at [Stanford] is a harbinger of population-level inequities of vaccine distribution for our underserved communities,” Dr. Christine Santiago, a resident in Stanford’s internal medicine program, tweeted Friday.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

{'_id': '8ce10cdfc65869e1d4e2288a211b2ac5', 'title': 'Trump Fears That His Influence Is Waning', 'description': 'As his days in office come to a close, President Donald Trump has hinted to those close to him that he’s worried his influence within Republican circles may be waning. Fearful of party stalwarts growing comfortable crossing him, the president has pushed to keep up the pressure and plot possible revenge scenarios against potential turncoats, according to three people who spoke to him as he unwound at Mar-a-Lago and elsewhere over the holiday weekend.“Why aren’t they just listening [to me]?” one of the sources recalled Trump asking during a diatribe against prominent GOPers who the president felt weren’t fighting for him on his current battle lines: from nullifying the 2020 election outcome, to torpedoing liability law for Big Tech, to sending out $2,000 checks for COVID-19 relief.The comments came during Trump’s Christmas getaway in Florida this past weekend and for those who heard them they were some of the clearest indications to date that the president has reached an inflection point. Outwardly insistent that he was robbed of a re-election victory, he has privately groused that too many in his party are acknowledging the reality of his actual loss and showing signs of tiptoeing away from him.At other points during the long Christmas weekend, the president continued bemoaning the perceived lack of fealty from various elected Republicans, the sources recounted. He rattled off names such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (for being, in Trump’s estimation, a “wise guy”), and even his own VP, Mike Pence.“He is keeping a running [mental] list of Republicans who he believes have wronged him since the election,” a source close to Trump said. “The president certainly wants it out there that he’s capable of holding a grudge, and that he has campaigned against [some] Republicans before and could do it again.”Trump Grows Increasingly Angry With FDA, Wonders if COVID Vaccine Makers Are ‘Democrats’Trump’s musings evoke a president at once eager to portray himself as mighty and tacitly fearful that his aura of political power may be breaking.The president keeps insisting to his supporters that he could somehow still cling to that power—with President-elect Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington, D.C., fast approaching—through increasingly anti-democratic efforts to nullify the election results. But privately, the president has begun losing faith in the work of even some of his most diehard surrogates and allied attorneys. Last week, Trump had informed the conspiracy theory-spouting lawyer (and former member of his legal team) Sidney Powell that he did not intend to appoint her “special counsel” to investigate election “fraud,” as the two of them had once discussed. And in recent days, he’s acknowledged to some confidants, with apparent disappointment, that Powell keeps “striking out” in court and overpromising but underdelivering in her crusade of wild allegations of a massive conspiracy, two people familiar with his admissions said.As Trump and many of his MAGA devotees look to the Jan. 6 session in Congress for certifying the Electoral College vote as a potential last stand, the outgoing president’s already limited attention to the responsibilities of the office he holds has dwindled even further. Limited resources and attention are now being paid to even his primary objectives.After weeks of trumpeting his administration’s coronavirus vaccine rollout as one of the crowning jewels of his time in office, Trump has tried this week to shovel as much guilt as possible onto the states for the slower-than-projected rollout. He has pushed publicly for Congress to pass $2,000 checks to Americans for COVID relief. But he’s done little to work Republicans on Capitol Hill to support the measure, save the occasional Twitter excoriation for potentially bucking him. Although his White House has gone to great lengths to pretend as if it is readying for a second term, members of his staff have quietly begun leaving.Derek Kan, formerly a senior official at Trump’s Transportation Department and White House budget office, became one the latest to do so when he filed ethics exit paperwork this week noting that he’d left the administration on Dec. 5. A source familiar with his post-administration plans told The Daily Beast that Kan will be advising the investment firm Oaktree Capital. The ethics paperwork also indicates he’s lined up a gig with Deliverr, a San Francisco-based eCommerce fulfillment startup.“Actions speak louder than words, and from what we’re seeing of staff leaving the White House and preparations others are making to leave, it’s sinking in what will happen on Jan. 20,” said Steven Groves, who served as a lawyer, and then spokesman, in the Trump White House. “Even though it appears President Trump knows this, he still knows how to command the press’ attention. But to me, as a conservative, any energy spent by the Republican Party at this time that is not directed at the Senate races in Georgia is misdirected.”Trump Tweets Conspiracy About Georgia Secretary of State’s ‘Brother’ Who ‘Works for China’Individuals close to Trump and several of his senior aides say that in recent weeks, the president has struggled behind closed doors to hide his feelings of loss, frustration, and disappointment. Often, he has reverted to his old habits of sheltering himself from voices of mild dissent in his own ranks, ones who would tell him to let it go with even a modicum of grace.Trump is determined to keep up appearances, attending various social functions and parties, where he is feted by the Trump faithful. And many of his friends insist that he is, whatever the contradictory evidence may be, not mad or losing heart.On Sunday evening, Trump took a brief moment during a buffet feast at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach to reunite with his former political adviser Roger Stone, whom he had just pardoned the week prior. Stone said he was at the club that night as a guest of Christopher Ruddy, the Newsmax CEO and another Trump pal.When asked about what Stone and the president discussed, Ruddy told The Daily Beast, “I don’t comment on any of the private dinners,” adding that the “president has seemed upbeat about things lately.”In the midst of his building despondency, Trump is seizing on little, unexpected joys where he can find and get them. This week, Gallup announced that its public polling shows that Trump now ranks as the “Most Admired” man in the United States, ending his predecessor Barack Obama’s 12-year stretch as the most admired man. According to Gallup, that would make Obama “tied with Dwight Eisenhower for the most ever.”The “Most Admired” man and woman surveys that Gallup conducts annually lean heavily on name recognition and national fame, and it is incredibly common that the sitting president, no matter who it is, emerges as a winner. Given that metric, it actually took Trump an unusually long time to topple Obama from the top spot, as the former Democratic president bested Trump for most of the years of the latter’s term.To some presidents, that might come off as embarrassing. But not to Trump. According to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, soon after the president was informed of how he, in Trump’s own words, “beat Obama” this year, Trump specifically instructed aides to publicly promote it far and wide.—With additional reporting by Lloyd GroveRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Andriy Onufriyenko/Moment via Getty ImagesTens of millions of people across the U.S. have received a coronavirus vaccine. So far, the majority of doses have been either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, both of which use mRNA to generate an immune response. These gene-based vaccines have been in the works for decades, but this is the first time they have been used widely in people. MRNA vaccines are proving to be more effective than anyone had hoped, but as with any new medical advancement, people have a lot of questions. How do they work? Are they safe? Do I really need two shots? Why do they need to be kept so cold? And will this be the vaccine technology of the future? Below, we highlight five articles from The Conversation that will help answer your questions about mRNA vaccines. 1. A vaccine revolution “DNA and mRNA vaccines offer huge advantages over traditional types of vaccines, since they use only genetic code from a pathogen – rather than the entire virus or bacteria,” writes Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist at the University of Washington who has been working on gene-based vaccines for decades. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are proof that mRNA vaccines are ready for prime time – and far surpass their predecessors. “The hopes that gene-based vaccines could one day provide a vaccine for malaria or HIV, cure cancer, replace less effective traditional vaccines or be ready to stop the next pandemic before it gets started are no longer far-fetched,” explains Fuller. 2. How does an mRNA vaccine work? These vaccines are not only effective, they work in a fundamentally different way from traditional vaccines, explains Sanjay Mishra, a staff scientist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Traditional vaccines use an entire dead virus – or just a piece of one – to generate immunity. “But an mRNA vaccine is different,” writes Mishra, “because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material – mRNA – that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body.” Just as the pandemic hit, mRNA vaccine research had reached a tipping point. CDC/Alissa Eckert, MSMI; Dan Higgins, MAMS 3. Quick to market, but still safe “Safety is the first and foremost goal for a vaccine,” says William Petri, a Professor of Medicine at the University of Virginia. A lot of people have expressed safety concerns based on how fast these vaccines were developed, approved and distributed. According to Petri, the vaccines still went through every normal step – they just did them simultaneously. “In my opinion, safety is not compromised by the speed of vaccine development and emergency use authorization. The reason that vaccines may be approved so quickly is that the large clinical trials to assess vaccine efficacy and safety are happening at the same time as the large-scale manufacturing preparation, funded by the federal government’s Operation Warp Speed program.” 4. Why it’s important to get your second shot You got your first vaccine shot. But with shortages and supply problems, getting the second dose might be becoming a hassle. Does it really matter? Yes, explains William Petri in another article. “The first dose primes the immune system and introduces the body to the germ of interest. This allows the immune system to prepare its defense. The second dose, or booster, provides the opportunity for the immune system to ramp up the quality and quantity of the antibodies used to fight the virus.” Immunity is a complex process, and “if the booster isn’t given within the appropriate window, lower quantities of antibodies will be produced that may not provide as powerful protection from the virus,” writes Petri. So go get your second shot if you can, even if you have to get it a bit later than expected. Both doses are important for full immunity. AP Photo/Paul Sancya 5. Subzero storage makes distribution a challenge For all of their amazing attributes, mRNA vaccines do have at least one weakness: “If they get too warm or too cold they spoil. And, just like fish, a spoiled vaccine must be thrown away,” explains Anna Nagurney, Professor of Operations Management at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studies medical supply chains. The mRNA molecule is very fragile, so vaccines need to be kept at extremely cold, very specific temperatures – a challenge for distribution. “The answer is something called the vaccine cold chain – a supply chain that can keep vaccines in tightly controlled temperatures from the moment they are made to the moment that they are administered to a person,” explains Nagurney. This cold supply chain is critical to getting vaccines where they need to go, and without it, no matter how good the vaccines are, they can’t make much of a difference.

Citing two unidentified Japanese intelligence sources, Harry Kazianis, a North Korea expert at the U.S. think tank Center for the National Interest, said the Kims and several senior North Korean officials had been vaccinated within the last 2-3 weeks. He added that it was unclear which company had supplied its drug candidate to the Kims and whether it had proven to be safe. Citing a U.S. medical scientist, Kazianis also said at least three Chinese companies were developing a coronavirus vaccine, including Sinovac, CanSinoBio and Sinopharm. Sinopharm says its candidate has been used by nearly one million people in China. But none of the firms are known to have publicly launched late-stage clinical trials of their experimental COVID-19 drugs. However, other experts have expressed doubt that Kim would use an experimental vaccine.

His plan includes a global network of research hubs, more vaccine manufacturing capacity, and an agreement to reduce export tariffs imposed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Johnson also announced 340 million pounds ($433.23 million) in funding for the WHO spread across four years - a 30% increase on the previous four-year commitment - with around a third of the money dependent on reform to the organization.

"I was trying to be a tom boy at the same time, trying to mask up all my emotions so that whatever you say does not get to me and all that stuff, but at some point, you can only just hide from the whole world but inside, in my corners, I would cry.\'\' On Tuesday (August 25), the World Health Organization was celebrating that all 47 countries of its African region are free of endemic wild polio - a crippling viral disease that attacks the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours. The declaration comes four years after the last case was recorded in Ijigbamigbe\'s native Nigeria and 32 years after the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which is backed by the WHO, launched its campaign. At the time polio was endemic in 125 countries worldwide and paralyzing nearly 1,000 children a day. Since then vaccinations have drastically cut the number of cases but a vaccine-derived strain of the disease continues to circulate in Africa. It can infect people where there is only partial vaccination - and results in the same symptoms as the wild form. Misbahu Lawan-Didi contracted the virus at the age of two and is now chairman of the Association of Polio Survivors. He urged continued vaccination to prevent the disease from resurfacing. \'\'It is the only protective measure, it is the only way that we are sure that Nigeria will no longer have childhood polio in our country.\'\' For Ijigbamigbe, she\'s happy that other children will not have to go through the emotional pain that she suffered as a child - but the award-winning Lagos state swimmer and wheelchair basketball player says that for the thousands living with the effects of the disease Africa, it does not have to be a barrier. \'\'Polio is not a death sentence, I am here, I am standing, I am here sitting so polio is not a death sentence.

TRUMP: &quot;Ideally, we won&#39;t go to a lockdown. I will not go. This administration will not be going to a lockdown. Hopefully, the... the, uh, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration will be? I guess time will tell. But I can tell you, this administration will not go to a lockdown.&quot;               Trump made the comments at an Operation Warp Speed news conference, during which he said he expects a coronavirus vaccine to be available to the general population as soon as April. He left the podium without taking questions despite loud clamoring from reporters.               Friday&#39;s briefing came just hours after Edison Research projected that Biden won the state of Georgia, while Trump won North Carolina. Those two states were the last to be called in the U.S. presidential race, lifting Biden&#39;s Electoral College vote total to 306 - the same number Trump reached in 2016, which he called a landslide victory.               Biden&#39;s team has been pressing ahead with a transition despite the Trump administration&#39;s refusal to provide intelligence briefings, access to federal office space and other resources.               In an exclusive interview with Politico, Trump&#39;s former Chief of Staff John Kelly said Trump doesn&#39;t have to concede but said the wait over Biden receiving intelligence briefings &quot;hurts our national security.&quot;               Meanwhile, Trump is forging ahead with a long-shot litigation effort to try to overturn the results of the presidential election.               In the most recent blow to that strategy, a Michigan state court on Friday rejected a request by Trump supporters to block the certification of votes in Detroit, which went heavily in favor of Biden.                In another setback on Friday, the Trump campaign dropped a lawsuit in Arizona seeking an audit of all ballots, after it was clear the margin of victory could not be overcome. Biden was projected as the winner in Arizona late Thursday night, according to Edison Research.               Biden&#39;s legal advisers have dismissed the Trump lawsuits as political theater and legal experts say they&#39;re very unlikely to change the outcome of the election and are likely mostly about fundraising.               In recent days, Trump&#39;s supporters have been bombarded with fundraising emails asking for money to help pay for what the campaign says are legal challenges to the election results. But a Reuters review of the legal language in the solicitations found that any small-dollar donations won&#39;t be going to legal expenses at all. And the fine print makes clear that most of the money will go to other priorities.               Trump&#39;s campaign has been working on retiring its debt and contributions to his legal fund can also be used for that purpose.', 'num_of_covid': 6}

In a serious blow less than a week ahead of key regional elections, the MPs were accused of accepting backhand payments to broker government contracts for facemasks. Nikolas Löbel resigned as an MP and as a member of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrat party (CDU) on Monday after admitting he accepted a commission of €250,000 (£215,000) for arranging a local government contract. “To be a member of the German Bundestag and represent my hometown Mannheim there is a great honor and a special moral obligation,” Mr Löbel said in a statement. “I violated this obligation with my actions. I would like to apologise to all the citizens of the country.” A second MP, Georg Nüsslein, denies allegations he accepted backhanders of more than €600,000 (£515,000) to broker facemask contracts for the Bavarian regional government. Mr Nüsslein resigned from Mrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), on Monday but has so far resisted calls to give up his seat in parliament. The scandal comes with Mrs Merkel’s government already facing public anger over Germany's slow and chaotic vaccine roll-out. The allegations have hit the CDU hard in the run-up to elections in two states that are expected to serve as a bellwether for September’s general election. In polling in Baden-Württemberg, traditionally a CDU stronghold, the party is 11 points behind the rival Greens, while in Rhineland-Palatinate it is 4 points behind the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD). Party grandees reacted furiously to the allegations. Mr Löbel initially tried to cling on in parliament but resigned after Armin Laschet, the CDU leader, called on him to go. “Such behaviour is indecent and we are ashamed,” Paul Ziemiak, the CDU secretary-general, said. “If you've held up your hand to something like that, you've got to resign.” Markus Söder, the CSU leader, called on Mr Nusslein to stand down as an MP but admitted the party could not force him to resign his seat. “It is intolerable when representatives of the people try to turn a crisis into a business opportunity,” Mr Söder said.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

Associated PressThe new year has brought the deadliest weeks of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic thus far, with thousands of deaths every day. It’s been several weeks since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first of two emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, but getting one isn’t easy. There are no available appointments to get a vaccine in many communities. Wait times at California’s Dodger Stadium, the nation’s largest distribution site, reached five hours earlier this month. At the current rate, it could take until 2022 for all adult Americans to be vaccinated, according to some estimates. The Biden administration is trying to change that. The national strategy President Biden rolled out in his first week in office includes a target of injecting 100 million vaccines during his first 100 days as president and strengthening distribution to high-risk communities. A key component of the president’s five-step vaccine plan, he said, is to “fully activate the pharmacies across the country.” This will greatly expand the number of providers to administer vaccines – and expand the role of pharmacists in the pandemic in the weeks and months ahead. As pharmacists who work in both rural and urban settings, we are among those who are preparing to meet this challenge. Challenges with handling and distribution With the slow rollout, community pharmacies are being brought on board much sooner than anticipated. They’ve been an underutilized resource: U.S. pharmacies have experience storing and administering many types of vaccines. In 2018, they gave about one-third of all flu shots, up from 18% in 2012. They are now preparing to handle the new Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have a new, but not unknown, mechanism. The Moderna vaccine can be kept in a traditional freezer, but the Pfizer vaccine requires ultra-cold storage at -112 to -76 F before being thawed and administered. Health systems and federal partner pharmacies equipped with these specialized freezers are key hubs for distribution. It’s not just the vaccine that needs to be protected. Pharmacies are stockpiling personal protective equipment to keep staff safe. They have also established safety protocols for patients – social distancing, disinfection and observation for 15 to 30 minutes after vaccination. There are also administrative requirements, issuing immunization cards to those who have been immunized and reporting the number of administered doses to state and federal officials. Pharmacies are registering with the searchable Vaccine Finder website – where people will be able to search for participating pharmacies. The vaccine is free: Insurance companies will be billed an administration fee, though a national relief fund covers that cost for the uninsured. Under a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate, pharmacists and pharmacist interns who have completed a minimum of 20 hours of accredited training are authorized to administer COVID-19 vaccines. The U.S. is amidst the deadliest wave of the pandemic. COVID Tracking Project Sharing information While health departments and local officials are working to share information, many people are calling their local pharmacies with questions. Because the vaccine was produced, tested and approved in record time, some are questioning its safety. It was produced quickly because government funding fast-tracked various phases of development, allowing them to be conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially. Thousands of volunteers signed up for clinical trials, speeding the process, and emergency FDA approval allowed for rollout while some phase 3 studies are completed. People are also concerned about contracting coronavirus from the vaccine, which is impossible. Neither mRNA vaccine contains live virus; they simply teach the body to recognize the unique spike protein on the outside of the COVID-19 virus to create a faster immune response to the invader if exposed. Two doses must be spaced 21 to 28 days apart, and it takes another few weeks after the second dose to reach full immunity. Pharmacists can administer vaccinations and also answer questions about vaccines. C.C. Chapman/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND Some who have called us are worried about possible side effects. The most commonly reported aftereffect is pain and swelling at the injection site; some individuals have also reported chills, fever, headache or fatigue. While this may be uncomfortable, it’s not alarming: These are all signs that the immune system is doing its job. We have also helped explain to people why all are monitored after their shot. A few people have had serious allergic reactions – anaphylactic shock, which is why there is an established observation period after the vaccine that is longer for anyone with a history of allergies. Pharmacists are trained to respond to these rare reactions should they occur. There have also been reports of individuals who have died within days or weeks of receiving the vaccine. Researchers are investigating these rare events, but so far, there is no evidence that the vaccine is responsible. Unrelated or “incidental” illness seems to be the culprit, which is unsurprising given the demographics – many of those vaccinated in the early rollout are elderly people who are in frail health. Vaccines have the power to bring this pandemic under control. They could possibly even end it, but only after some 70% of humanity is inoculated. Almost 90% of Americans live within five miles of a local pharmacy where, starting in February, many will be able to get vaccinated against this virus.

Here's Our Chance to Stop It for Good.", 'description': 'Across the United States, and the world, the coronavirus seems to be loosening its stranglehold. The deadly curve of cases, hospitalizations and deaths has yo-yoed before, but never has it plunged so steeply and so fast. Is this it, then? Is this the beginning of the end? After a year of being pummeled by grim statistics and scolded for wanting human contact, many Americans feel a long-promised deliverance is at hand. Americans will win against the virus and regain many aspects of their pre-pandemic lives, most scientists now believe. Of the 21 interviewed for this article, all were optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is past. This summer, they said, life may begin to seem normal again. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times But — of course, there’s always a but — researchers are also worried that Americans, so close to the finish line, may once again underestimate the virus. So far, the two vaccines authorized in the United States are spectacularly effective, and after a slow start, the vaccination rollout is picking up momentum. A third vaccine is likely to be authorized shortly, adding to the nation’s supply. But it will be many weeks before vaccinations make a dent in the pandemic. And now the virus is shape-shifting faster than expected, evolving into variants that may partly sidestep the immune system. The latest variant was discovered in New York City only this week, and another worrisome version is spreading at a rapid pace through California. Scientists say a contagious variant first discovered in Britain will become the dominant form of the virus in the United States by the end of March. The road back to normalcy is potholed with unknowns: how well vaccines prevent further spread of the virus; whether emerging variants remain susceptible enough to the vaccines; and how quickly the world is immunized, so as to halt further evolution of the virus. But the greatest ambiguity is human behavior. Can Americans desperate for normalcy keep wearing masks and distancing themselves from family and friends? How much longer can communities keep businesses, offices and schools closed? COVID-19 deaths will most likely never rise quite as precipitously as in the past, and the worst may be behind us. But if Americans let down their guard too soon — many states are already lifting restrictions — and if the variants spread in the United States as they have elsewhere, another spike in cases may well arrive in the coming weeks. Scientists call it the fourth wave. The new variants mean “we’re essentially facing a pandemic within a pandemic,” said Adam Kucharski, a publich health expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The declines are real, but they disguise worrying trends. The United States has now recorded 500,000 deaths amid the pandemic, a terrible milestone. As of Wednesday morning, at least 28.3 million people have been infected. But the rate of new infections has tumbled by 35% over the past two weeks, according to a database maintained by The New York Times. Hospitalizations are down 31%, and deaths have fallen by 16%. Yet the numbers are still at the horrific highs of November, scientists noted. At least 3,210 people died of COVID-19 on Wednesday alone. And there is no guarantee that these rates will continue to decrease. “Very, very high case numbers are not a good thing, even if the trend is downward,” said Marc Lipsitch, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. “Taking the first hint of a downward trend as a reason to reopen is how you get to even higher numbers.” In late November, for example, Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island limited social gatherings and some commercial activities in the state. Eight days later, cases began to decline. The trend reversed eight days after the state’s pause lifted on Dec. 20. The virus’s latest retreat in Rhode Island and most other states, experts said, results from a combination of factors: growing numbers of people with immunity to the virus, either from having been infected or from vaccination; changes in behavior in response to the surges of a few weeks ago; and a dash of seasonality — the effect of temperature and humidity on the survival of the virus. Parts of the country that experienced huge surges in infection, like Montana and Iowa, may be closer to herd immunity than other regions. But patchwork immunity alone cannot explain the declines throughout much of the world. The vaccines were first rolled out to residents of nursing homes and to the elderly, who are at highest risk of severe illness and death. That may explain some of the current decline in hospitalizations and deaths. But young people drive the spread of the virus, and most of them have not yet been inoculated. And the bulk of the world’s vaccine supply has been bought up by wealthy nations, which have amassed 1 billion more doses than needed to immunize their populations. Vaccination cannot explain why cases are dropping even in countries where not a single soul has been immunized, like Honduras, Kazakhstan or Libya. The biggest contributor to the sharp decline in infections is something more mundane, scientists say: behavioral change. Leaders in the United States and elsewhere stepped up community restrictions after the holiday peaks. But individual choices have also been important, said Lindsay Wiley, an expert in public health law and ethics at American University in Washington. “People voluntarily change their behavior as they see their local hospital get hit hard, as they hear about outbreaks in their area,” she said. “If that’s the reason that things are improving, then that’s something that can reverse pretty quickly, too.” The downward curve of infections with the original coronavirus disguises an exponential rise in infections with B.1.1.7, the variant first identified in Britain, according to many researchers. “We really are seeing two epidemic curves,” said Ashleigh Tuite, an infectious disease modeler at the University of Toronto. The B.1.1.7 variant is thought to be more contagious and more deadly, and it is expected to become the predominant form of the virus in the United States by late March. The number of cases with the variant in the United States has risen from 76 in 12 states as of Jan. 13 to more than 1,800 in 45 states now. Actual infections may be much higher because of inadequate surveillance efforts in the United States. Buoyed by the shrinking rates over all, however, governors are lifting restrictions across the United States and are under enormous pressure to reopen completely. Should that occur, B.1.1.7 and the other variants are likely to explode. “Everybody is tired, and everybody wants things to open up again,” Tuite said. “Bending to political pressure right now, when things are really headed in the right direction, is going to end up costing us in the long term.” Another wave may be coming, but it can be minimized. Looking ahead to late March or April, the majority of scientists interviewed by The Times predicted a fourth wave of infections. But they stressed that it is not an inevitable surge, if government officials and individuals maintain precautions for a few more weeks. A minority of experts were more sanguine, saying they expected powerful vaccines and an expanding rollout to stop the virus. And a few took the middle road. “We’re at that crossroads, where it could go well or it could go badly,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The vaccines have proved to be more effective than anyone could have hoped, so far preventing serious illness and death in nearly all recipients. At present, about 1.4 million Americans are vaccinated each day. More than 45 million Americans have received at least one dose. A team of researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle tried to calculate the number of vaccinations required per day to avoid a fourth wave. In a model completed before the variants surfaced, the scientists estimated that vaccinating just 1 million Americans a day would limit the magnitude of the fourth wave. “But the new variants completely changed that,” said Dr. Joshua Schiffer, an infectious disease specialist who led the study. “It’s just very challenging scientifically — the ground is shifting very, very quickly.” Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, described herself as “a little more optimistic” than many other researchers. “We would be silly to undersell the vaccines,” she said, noting that they are effective against the fast-spreading B.1.1.7 variant. But Dean worried about the forms of the virus detected in South Africa and Brazil that seem less vulnerable to the vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. (On Wednesday, Johnson & Johnson reported that its vaccine was relatively effective against the variant found in South Africa.) About 50 infections with those two variants have been identified in the United States, but that could change. Because of the variants, scientists do not know how many people who were infected and had recovered are now vulnerable to reinfection. South Africa and Brazil have reported reinfections with the new variants among people who had recovered from infections with the original version of the virus. “That makes it a lot harder to say, ‘If we were to get to this level of vaccinations, we’d probably be OK,’” said Sarah Cobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago. Yet the biggest unknown is human behavior, experts said. The sharp drop in cases now may lead to complacency about masks and distancing, and to a wholesale lifting of restrictions on indoor dining, sporting events and more. Or … not. “The single biggest lesson I’ve learned during the pandemic is that epidemiological modeling struggles with prediction, because so much of it depends on human behavioral factors,” said Carl Bergstrom, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Taking into account the counterbalancing rises in both vaccinations and variants, along with the high likelihood that people will stop taking precautions, a fourth wave is highly likely this spring, the majority of experts told The Times. Kristian Andersen, a virus expert at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, said he was confident that the number of cases will continue to decline, then plateau in about a month. After mid-March, the curve in new cases will swing upward again. In early to mid-April, “we’re going to start seeing hospitalizations go up,” he said. “It’s just a question of how much.” Summer will feel like summer again, sort of. Now the good news. Despite the uncertainties, the experts predict that the last surge will subside in the United States sometime in the early summer. If the Biden administration can keep its promise to immunize every American adult by the end of the summer, the variants should be no match for the vaccines. Combine vaccination with natural immunity and the human tendency to head outdoors as weather warms, and “it may not be exactly herd immunity, but maybe it’s sufficient to prevent any large outbreaks,” said Youyang Gu, an independent data scientist, who created some of the most prescient models of the pandemic. Infections will continue to drop. More important, hospitalizations and deaths will fall to negligible levels — enough, hopefully, to reopen the country. “Sometimes people lose vision of the fact that vaccines prevent hospitalization and death, which is really actually what most people care about,” said Stefan Baral, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even as the virus begins its swoon, people may still need to wear masks in public places and maintain social distance, because a significant percent of the population — including children — will not be immunized. “Assuming that we keep a close eye on things in the summer and don’t go crazy, I think that we could look forward to a summer that is looking more normal, but hopefully in a way that is more carefully monitored than last summer,” said Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland. Imagine: Groups of vaccinated people will be able to get together for barbecues and play dates, without fear of infecting one another. Beaches, parks and playgrounds will be full of mask-free people. Indoor dining will return, along with movie theaters, bowling alleys and shopping malls — although they may still require masks. The virus will still be circulating, but the extent will depend in part on how well vaccines prevent not just illness and death, but also transmission. The data on whether vaccines stop the spread of the disease are encouraging, but immunization is unlikely to block transmission entirely. “It’s not zero and it’s not 100 — exactly where that number is will be important,” said Shweta Bansal, an infectious disease modeler at Georgetown University. “It needs to be pretty darn high for us to be able to get away with vaccinating anything below 100% of the population, so that’s definitely something we’re watching.” Over the long term — say, a year from now, when all the adults and children in the United States who want a vaccine have received them — will this virus finally be behind us? Every expert interviewed by The Times said no. Even after the vast majority of the American population has been immunized, the virus will continue to pop up in clusters, taking advantage of pockets of vulnerability. Years from now, the coronavirus may be an annoyance, circulating at low levels, causing modest colds. Many scientists said their greatest worry post-pandemic was that new variants may turn out to be significantly less susceptible to the vaccines. Billions of people worldwide will remain unprotected, and each infection gives the virus new opportunities to mutate. “We won’t have useless vaccines. We might have slightly less good vaccines than we have at the moment,” said Andrew Read, an evolutionary microbiologist at Penn State University. “That’s not the end of the world, because we have really good vaccines right now.” For now, every one of us can help by continuing to be careful for just a few more months, until the curve permanently flattens. “Just hang in there a little bit longer,” Tuite said. “There’s a lot of optimism and hope, but I think we need to be prepared for the fact that the next several months are likely to continue to be difficult.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Susan Collins (R-Maine) led a group of 10 Republican senators — including fellow moderates Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) — that on Sunday announced plans to unveil a $600 million COVID-19 relief package they believe could serve as a bipartisan alternative to President Biden\'s $1.9 trillion plan, which the GOP has deemed too expensive. The details are expected to be released Monday, though The Washington Post reports it will likely not include Biden\'s proposal to increase the federal minimum wage and it will also reportedly narrow eligibility for a new round of $1,400 stimulus checks to individuals earning $50,000 per year or less or couples earing $100,000 per year or less. The Republicans want to meet with Biden to discuss their counterproposal. "We want to work in good faith with you and your administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges" of the COVID-19 pandemic, they wrote in a letter. Whether Democrats will be open to discussing the idea remains to be seen (Biden\'s top economic adviser reiterated Sunday that the president is determined to act swiftly), but, as the Post notes, the fact that 10 Republicans are on board with the plan is significant. If the two sides do reach a compromise that would give the Senate the 60 votes required to pass legislation without the Democrats having to seek a workaround. Read more at The Washington Post.

There are many challenges facing Walensky, President Joe Biden, and the rest of his administration, chiefly among them is COVID vaccine distribution. On Jan. 24, during an interview with Fox News Sunday, the new CDC head revealed to host Chris Wallace that "one of the biggest problems right now" regarding the pandemic centers on a certain unknown surrounding the COVID vaccine. Keep reading to find out Walensky\'s major concerns, and for more vaccine news, check out Moderna\'s Chief Medical Officer Just Gave This Upsetting Update. There are unknown quantities of the vaccine. "One of the biggest problems right now is I can\'t tell you how much vaccine we have, and if I can\'t tell it to you then I can\'t tell it to the governors and I can\'t tell it to the state health officials," Walensky told Fox News Sunday when asked about the situation she and the Biden administration inherited. "So, the fact that we don\'t know today, five days into this administration and weeks into planning, how much vaccine we have, just gives you a sense of the challenges we\'ve been left with." And for more changes to how shots are administered, check out The CDC Just Made This Major Update to Its Vaccine Guidelines. The supply is "the most limiting constraint," she said. The CDC has already acknowledged that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is currently running less smoothly than it should be and that an improved system will see more points of delivery opened, speeding the process up. "The goal is for everyone to be able to easily get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as large enough quantities are available. Once vaccine is widely available, the plan is to have several thousand vaccination providers offering COVID-19 vaccines in doctors\' offices, retail pharmacies, hospitals, and federally qualified health centers," the CDC wrote on its website on Jan. 5.In her interview with Fox News Sunday, Walenksy confirmed: "The supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraint early on. … We also need to sort of make sure that this, the supply, gets to pharmacies, that we have enough vaccinators, that we have enough places and outreach to do the vaccination." And for more on where you may be able to get vaccinated soon, check out You Can Now Get Your COVID Vaccine at Walmart in These 10 States. And that\'s why appointments are being canceled. Walensky highlighted that the lack of clarity on how much vaccine there is creates the issues of either unused vaccine or long lines and canceled appointments."If [states] don\'t know how much vaccine they\'re getting, not just this week but next week and the week after, they can\'t plan. They can\'t figure out how many sites to roll out, they can\'t figure out how many vaccinators that they need, and they can\'t figure out how many appointments to make for the public," she explained. "So, if they overshoot it, then we have vaccine on the shelf and if they undershoot it, we have these queues and queues of people, people whose appointments are canceled… Either way, we have challenges." States running low may not get new vaccine right away. Walensky was upfront about the fact that states that are running short on vaccines may not be able to secure immediate replenishment. She admitted that the government does not "have as many doses as we would like now for states like New York [or] for other states that are claiming to have run out of vaccine." And for more regular COVID updates, sign up for our daily newsletter. Walensky said 100 million vaccinations in 100 days is just the beginning. Before he was sworn in, President Biden pledged that this administration would give 100 million COVID-19 vaccinations in their first 100 days in office, a goal he\'s since stood by. But Walensky stressed that this was only a starting point and a first target to hit in a longer-running campaign."My understanding is that the current supply crunch is the one that… I\'m most worried about. We have every indication that over time we\'ll get more and more vaccine. So we certainly can\'t predict any of the obstacles that would come in our way here. But from the data that I\'ve seen so far, I\'m hopeful that we\'ll actually get an increasing amount of supply, not a stagnating one," she said. "We\'re really hoping that after that first 100 days we\'ll have much more production, not just for these two vaccines [Moderna and Pfizer], but we are hopeful that we\'ll have another one from Johnson&Johnson in the weeks ahead and perhaps even a fourth coming down the pipeline. So we are really hoping that we\'ll have more vaccines and that will increase the pace at which we can do the vaccinations."

{'_id': '8f8517fc0961ecc9d7900cf439984fae', 'title': "'Like a Hand Grasping': Trump Appointees Describe the Crushing of the CDC", 'description': 'ATLANTA -- Kyle McGowan, a former chief of staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and his deputy, Amanda Campbell, were installed in 2018 as two of the youngest political appointees in the history of the world\'s premier public health agency, young Republicans returning to their native Georgia to dream jobs.But what they witnessed during the coronavirus pandemic this year in the CDC\'s leadership suite on the 12-floor headquarters here shook them: Washington\'s dismissal of science, the White House\'s slow suffocation of the agency\'s voice, the meddling in its messages and the siphoning of its budget.In interviews this fall, the pair decided to go public with their disillusionment: what went wrong, and what they believe needs to be done as the agency girds for what could be a yearslong project of rebuilding its credibility externally while easing ill feelings and self-doubt internally.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times"Everyone wants to describe the day that the light switch flipped and the CDC was sidelined. It didn\'t happen that way," McGowan said. "It was more of like a hand grasping something, and it slowly closes, closes, closes, closes until you realize that, middle of the summer, it has a complete grasp on everything at the CDC."Last week, the editor-in-chief of the CDC\'s flagship weekly disease outbreak reports -- once considered untouchable -- told House Democrats investigating political interference in the agency\'s work that she was ordered to destroy an email showing Trump appointees attempting to meddle with their publication.The same day, the outlines of the CDC\'s future took more shape when President-elect Joe Biden announced a slate of health nominees, including Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, as the agency\'s new director, a move generally greeted with enthusiasm by public health experts."We are ready to combat this virus with science and facts," she wrote on Twitter.McGowan and Campbell -- who joined the CDC in their early 30s, then left together in August -- said that mantra was what was most needed after a brutal year that left the agency\'s authority crippled.In November, McGowan held conversations with Biden transition officials reviewing the agency\'s response to the pandemic, where he said he was candid about its failures. Among the initiatives he encouraged the new administration to plan for: reviving regular -- if not daily -- news briefings featuring the agency\'s scientists.McGowan and Campbell, both 34, say they tried to protect their colleagues against political meddling from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services. But an agency created to protect the nation against a public health catastrophe like the coronavirus was largely stifled by the Trump administration.The White House insisted on reviewing -- and often softening -- the CDC\'s closely guarded coronavirus guidance documents, the most prominent public expression of its latest research and scientific consensus on the spread of the virus. The documents were vetted not only by the White House\'s coronavirus task force but by what felt to the agency\'s employees like an endless loop of political appointees across Washington.McGowan recalled a White House fixated on the economic implications of public health. He and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the CDC director, negotiated with Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, over social distancing guidelines for restaurants, as Vought argued that specific spacing recommendations would be too onerous for businesses to enforce."It is not the CDC\'s role to determine the economic viability of a guidance document," McGowan said.They compromised anyway, recommending social distancing without a reference to the typical 6-foot measurement.One of Campbell\'s responsibilities was helping clear the agency\'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, a widely followed and otherwise apolitical guide on infectious disease renowned in the medical community. Over the summer, political appointees at the health department repeatedly asked CDC officials to revise, delay and even scuttle drafts they thought could be viewed, by implication, as criticism of President Donald Trump."It wasn\'t until something was in the MMWR that was in contradiction to what message the White House and HHS were trying to put forward that they became scrutinized," Campbell said.Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC director under President Barack Obama, said it was typical and "legitimate" to have interagency process for review."What\'s not legitimate is to overrule science," he said.Often, McGowan and Campbell mediated between Redfield and agency scientists when the White House\'s requests and dictates would arrive: edits from Vought and Kellyanne Conway, the former White House adviser, on choirs and communion in faith communities, or suggestions from Ivanka Trump, the president\'s daughter and aide, on schools."Every time that the science clashed with the messaging, messaging won," McGowan said.Episodes of meddling sometimes turned absurd, they said. In the spring, the CDC published an app that allowed Americans to screen themselves for symptoms of COVID-19. But the Trump administration decided to develop a similar tool with Apple. White House officials then demanded that the CDC wipe its app off its website, McGowan said.Campbell said that at the pandemic\'s outset, she was confident the agency had the best scientists in the world at its disposal, "just like we had in the past.""What was so different, though, was the political involvement, not only from HHS but then the White House, ultimately, that in so many ways hampered what our scientists were able to do," she said.Top CDC officials devised workarounds. Instead of posting new guidance for schools and election officials in the spring, they published "updates" to previous guidance that skipped formal review from Washington. That prompted officials in Washington to insist on reviewing updates.Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesman, said that "all proposed guidelines and regulations with potentially sweeping effects on our economy, society and constitutional freedoms receive appropriate consultation from all stakeholders, including task force doctors, other experts and administration leaders."A CDC spokesman declined to comment.McGowan and Campbell both attended the University of Georgia and saw their CDC positions as homecomings. McGowan said the two institutions he revered most during his Georgia childhood were the CDC and Coca-Cola.He arrived with a resume that made the agency\'s senior ranks suspicious, he said. Like Campbell, he worked for former Rep. Tom Price, first in his House office, then when he was health secretary under Trump. When he arrived at the CDC, McGowan told his new colleagues that he was there not to spy on or undermine them, but to support them.McGowan and Campbell, who have since opened a health policy consulting firm, said they saw themselves as keepers of the agency\'s senior scientists, whose morale had been sapped. Redfield, whose leadership has been criticized roundly by public health experts and privately by his own scientists, was rarely in Atlanta, consumed by Washington responsibilities.That often left McGowan and Campbell as the agency\'s most senior political appointees in Atlanta -- two of only four at an 11,000-person agency.McGowan, who talked to Redfield throughout the day by phone, worked in the office next to Dr. Anne Schuchat, a 32-year career staff member who is the agency\'s principal deputy director and one of the country\'s most respected scientists, and became a sounding board for her.Earlier this year, Schuchat was targeted by political appointees at the health department, who began interrogating CDC officials about her public comments acknowledging the seriousness of the pandemic. Schuchat asked McGowan whether she would be fired."I don\'t know," McGowan recalled telling her. "Not yet."McGowan said he was especially unnerved last winter when officials in Washington told the CDC that regular telephone briefings with another senior scientist, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, were no longer needed because Trump had his own daily briefings. Messonnier angered the White House in late February when she issued a public warning that the virus was about to change Americans\' lives."There\'s not a single thing that she said that didn\'t come true," McGowan said. "Is it more important to have her telling the world and the American public what to be prepared for, or is it just to say, \'All is well\'?""It\'s demoralizing to spend your entire career preparing for this moment, preparing for a pandemic like this. And then not be able to fully do your job," McGowan said. "They need to be allowed to lead."Agency scientists have privately fretted about the pandemic permanently damaging the CDC\'s authority, with the public as well as state and international health partners. The CDC was wounded by its initial struggles to develop reliable tests for the coronavirus. Scientists have discussed resigning, including some in the senior ranks who told McGowan that even though they flirted with leaving, they would have a hard time walking away from the agency at its lowest point.Frieden said the agency had done "a lot of good work that they haven\'t been able to tell anyone about," including investigating outbreaks in prisons and meatpacking facilities. But he said its leaders had to speak out more."CDC has a big podium," he said. "You have to tell people what you know, when you know it. Otherwise you get a lack of alignment. It\'s not just the public. When you do those briefings, the public health departments and the doctors also learn."This fall, senior CDC officials turned bolder. They resumed regular news media briefings by agency scientists. Without seeking permission from Washington, they revised guidance documents on schools and asymptomatic testing, health officials said.Fears of mixing politics and science linger, like when Vice President Mike Pence visited the agency this month with Georgia\'s Republican senators, who are in critical runoff campaigns. Dr. Jay Butler, a top agency official, told a colleague that he worried that if Pence discussed the campaign, CDC employees at the event might violate the law prohibiting federal workers from engaging in political activities on the job, according to someone with knowledge of his concern. A White House lawyer wrote Butler to say that the event was unrelated to a campaign stop later in the day, and would not be political.Among the obvious targets for reform is the agency\'s budget, which has been micromanaged, especially by Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, who has argued against CDC funds in coronavirus stimulus negotiations.Dr. Barry R. Bloom, an infectious disease expert and public health professor at Harvard, said the CDC\'s money problems could help explain its predicament. Unlike some federal health agencies, such at the National Institutes of Health, the CDC typically receives what public health experts see as paltry funding -- a reflection of its often low-profile work."They track down everything from pollution to outbreaks in prisons," Bloom said. "That\'s the daily work of CDC. If it\'s well done and tracked down, it will not appear in the pages of your newspaper."The funding the CDC did receive this year was cannibalized. Redfield told lawmakers that $300 million was steered from the CDC\'s budget to a vaccine public relations campaign that recently collapsed under scrutiny from reporters and lawmakers.The redirecting of the funding was just one more blow to an agency brought low by a pandemic it was alerted to only a year ago. McGowan has held on to the email thread from Dec. 31, 2019, about a "cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China," a haunting artifact."Damage has been done to the CDC that will take years to undo," he said. "And that\'s terrible to hear, because it happened under my time there."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Read on to discover what it revealed, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.Dr. Fauci Described the Newly Proven "Added Benefit" of Face MasksDr. Fauci was over the moon about this new study. "I mean, obviously— if you put a mask on, you prevent the exhaling of droplets that would infect others," he said. "So it\'s very clear that you are protecting someone and their mask is protecting you." So what\'s the new news? "Recent data has now shown the added benefit [is that the mask protects] you from droplets and virus that\'s coming your way. So it\'s a two-way street in that the benefit of masks, right now, as people examine more and more of the data, it\'s very clear that it is very helpful."Dr. Fauci considers the mask an important tool along with his other fundamentals. "That\'s the reason why whenever you get the cascade of four or five things that we talk about that we need to do even more so as we get into the cooler months—wearing of mask, keeping physical distance, avoiding crowds, doing things to the extent that you can with the weather, more outdoor than indoor, as well as washing hands—if we just did that consistently as a nation, not some doing it, others not, we will be much better off you put that together with the vaccine."RELATED: The Unhealthiest Supplements You Shouldn\'t TakeThe Life Saving Benefit "Cannot Be Overstated"Fauci\'s excitement comes on the heels of a study that showed\xa0 face masks, when worn outside of the home, could save more than 100,000 lives. "The potential life-saving benefit of increasing mask use in the coming fall and winter cannot be overstated," wrote the team from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington."If Americans would stop complaining about face masks and wear them when they leave their homes, they could save well over 100,000 lives — and perhaps more than half a million — through the end of February, according to a study published Friday in Nature Medicine," reports the Los Angeles Times of that study. "The researchers considered five scenarios for how the COVID-19 pandemic could play out with different levels of mask-wearing and rules about staying home and social distancing. All the scenarios assumed that no vaccine was available, nor any medicines capable of curing the disease. Consistently, the most effective — not to mention cheapest and easiest — way to reduce deaths was to increase the number of people wearing masks."RELATED: Dr. Fauci Says You Don\'t Have to Do This Anymore to Avoid COVIDHere\'s How to Avoid Death During the Pandemic"Their mask protects you and your mask also protects you," Fauci summed up.Nothing is guaranteed to prevent you from getting the virus, but follow Fauci\'s fundamentals:• Wear your\xa0face mask• get tested if you think you have coronavirus• avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties and family gatherings)• practice social distancing• only run essential errands• wash your hands regularly• disinfect frequently touched surfaces• remember it\'s always safer outside than insideand to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don\'t miss these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '438c2ec1e33befa8403c495ddffd3f41', 'title': 'The Biden Presidency Already Has Its First Conspiracy Theory: The Great Reset', 'description': "Joe Biden isn’t president yet. But his incoming White House already has its first conspiracy theory to deal with.It goes by the tag the “Great Reset” and under its construct a wild dystopian future is in store. The coronavirus pandemic is merely a means to enslave humanity and end capitalism. Biden’s “Build Back Better” slogan is really a cover for nefarious plotting of a global cabal from Davos, Switzerland, intent on abolishing private property and building prison camps for the dissenters who refuse to accept microchips that will read their thoughts. Even Grover from Sesame Street might be involved.The Great Reset is a hodgepodge of one-world-government fears that has gained steam in the wake of Biden’s win. It’s been fed by right-wing media personalities who have told their audiences that Biden is bent on launching said reset by using the coronavirus pandemic to ban religion, crush small businesses, and turn humans into something like robots—or replace them with actual robots.Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has declared that the Great Reset is “up in your grill,” while talk radio host Glenn Beck said the Great Reset is a plot to institute Nazi-style restrictions on American citizens. WorldNetDaily has called it a scheme from our “globalist overlords.” Pro-Trump personalities “Diamond and Silk” have warned their audience on Newsmax TV that Biden is behind the Great Reset plot.“You know Biden said he wants to build back better,” Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway said on Nov. 21 on her show, Diamond and Silk: Crystal Clear. “But no, he doesn’t want to build back better. He wants to take this economy and build back globally. You all, I know you heard about this thing called the Great Reset.”Diamond & Silk Suggest Fox News Executives ‘Ordered a Hit’ on ThemFox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham have also promoted the idea that Biden is a key player in a nefarious movement dubbed the Great Reset.“His handlers, who are basically all old Obama staffers, believe in something called the Great Reset of capitalism,” Ingraham said in a November episode of her show. “It’s a plan to force a more equitable distribution of global resources.”Despite the apocalyptic predictions of pro-Trump media figures, though, the supposed Great Reset’s actual origins are much more mundane.In May, the World Economic Forum—a non-governmental group that hosts the annual Davos conference—announced a series of events and articles called the Great Reset centered on the idea of reducing inequality in the aftermath of the pandemic. The series, summed up in a book of the same name from WEF chief Klaus Schwab, is made up of the same kind of vague, feel-good talk aimed at the world’s wealthy that amounts to thought leadership at Davos. The WEF’s Great Reset website is filled with buzzwords like “sustainability,” “upscaling,” and “stakeholder capitalism,” but few concrete plans—and certainly nothing like the world-destroying plot described in pro-Trump media.The WEF didn’t respond to a request for comment.Seth Meyers Brutally Mocks Sidney Powell, the Trump Lawyer ‘Too Insane’ for Tucker CarlsonIntrigued by the conspiracy theories, Spectator writer Ben Sixsmith reviewed Schwab’s Great Reset book and noted a number of differences between it and the Communist Manifesto. For one thing, Sixsmith wrote, the Communist Manifesto is actually interesting. Sixsmith noted that the WEF is supported by massive corporations like Apple and Pfizer, suggesting that Schwab and his group are hardly communist radicals.Still, right-wing media figures seized on Schwab’s “Great Reset” series this summer, seeing it as proof that coronavirus restrictions were in fact meant to destroy the world economy and make way for a much more sinister restructuring of governments, societies, and economies across the world. More speculation about the Great Reset has been fueled by a resurfaced picture of Schwab receiving an honorary degree in Lithuanian academic robes that, to some, appears sinister.“Klaus Schwab is Not a Member of the Church of Satan,” one blogger debunking the conspiracy theories wrote.The Great Reset conspiracy theory has come to encompass a huge number of hoaxes and smaller conspiracy theories surrounding the pandemic, often centering on fears of billionaire Bill Gates and a COVID-19 vaccine.The closest the Great Reset conspiracy theorists have to an agreed-upon text comes from Catholic Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, who has a history of sending pro-Trump open letters that are picked up on right-wing blogs. In a late October letter to Trump that Carlson later promoted on his Fox show, Viganò alleged that the Great Reset was a cover for a scheme built by Bill Gates centered on the “renunciation of private property and adherence to a program of vaccination against Covid-19.”In this theory, Viganò claimed, people who refused a global digital ID from a “health dictatorship” would be imprisoned in detention camps and lose their property.“A global plan called the Great Reset is underway,” Viganò wrote in his letter. “Its architect is a global elite that wants to subdue all of humanity, imposing coercive measures with which to drastically limit individual freedoms and those of entire populations.”> If you don't understand how the Governor of New Mexico could shut down grocery stores for two weeks, then you don't understand: the Great Reset.   >   > Read Archbishop Vigano's letter to President Trump if you want to understand what's going on.> > — Emerald Robinson ✝️ (@EmeraldRobinson) November 25, 2020After making inroads on the right this summer, the Great Reset trended on Twitter this month after a resurfaced September video of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau using the word “reset” in a speech about the pandemic went viral. A conservative Canadian parliamentarian earned tens of thousands of signatures on a petition denouncing the Great Reset. Since then, the Great Reset conspiracy has continued to thrive on social media, with a November video of conservative pundit Ben Shapiro talking about it pulling in more than 300,000 views on Facebook, according to analytics tool CrowdTangle.The Great Reset theory has also been embraced on fringe right-wing networks like Newsmax and One America News.“Now we have this push for what’s being called the Great Reset,” Newsmax host Michelle Malkin said on a Nov. 21 show. “And every aspect of the way that we live our lives, how we worship, whether we’re allowed to, how we’re raising our kids, how they’re allowed to access education, is being transformed based on nothing that is actually supported by real science.”In its focus on a foreign cabal instituting a nefarious liberal agenda, the Great Reset conspiracy theory appears to echo the infamous Obama-era conspiracy theory that the United Nations would impose a sinister plot called “Agenda 21,” with many of the same tropes but a new focus on vaccine fear-mongering for the pandemic era.Now Great Reset conspiracy promoters have claimed that Biden’s “Build Back Better” slogan is in fact a front for the Great Reset. Reporter Lara Logan, who hosts a show on Fox’s digital channel, posted an article on Twitter claiming that Build Back Better is a cover for “smashing everything to pieces.” On his show, Beck claimed that Build Back Better was “part now of the Great Reset.”In reality, Biden’s Build Back Better plan centers on rebuilding the economy after the coronavirus and addressing issues like failing infrastructure and racial equality. But for Great Reset fearmongers, the plan is just a cover for international figures like Schwab.The conspiracy theorists have even claimed that Sesame Street puppets are in on the scheme. Breitbart columnist James Delingpole, a major promoter of the Great Reset conspiracy theory, fumed that puppets Grover and Elmo recorded videos promoting vaccines and urging children to follow pandemic precautions, while Grover appeared on a WEF podcast about the virus.“Some of us are old enough to remember an era when this kind of blatant propaganda came only from countries behind the Iron Curtain,” Delingpole wrote of the puppet’s podcast interview.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The short answer to both questions is yes – the details are below – though any discomfort pales in comparison with contracting Covid-19. We used clinical trial data gathered by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to explore the kinds of side-effects most commonly associated with the three vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the US. Those vaccines were developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (Niaid) and most recently by Johnson & Johnson. What are the common side-effects? The Covid vaccine is injected deep into your body tissue, which can leave you feeling sore. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA For all the vaccines, the most common side-effects include: Soreness where the vaccine is injected. Fatigue. Headache and muscle soreness. Less common side-effects can also include nausea, chills and fever. The vast majority of symptoms cause discomfort, but not a total disruption of your daily habits. Are Covid-19 vaccines safe? Yes. Their safety is tested in large trials of tens of thousands of people, then the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to monitor vaccine safety data, including side-effects, after the vaccines are authorized. These are sometimes referred to as phase IV trials. That monitoring goes hand-in-hand with reporting through several vaccine safety registries. These ongoing studies can help identify the rarest of side-effects, and pinpoint people who may have special sensitivities to the vaccine, such as a potential for an allergic reaction. One of the key numbers included in the graphs below is the rate of people who experienced side-effects after receiving a “placebo”, or an injection of saline instead of the vaccine. People involved in the trials did not know whether or not they received the vaccine. This helps researchers understand the background rate of these side-effects in the population. Moderna vaccine side-effects Formally called mRNA-1273, this vaccine was developed by Moderna in partnership with the Niaid, but most people simply know it as the Moderna vaccine, which is a two-dose regimen spaced 28 days apart. A clinical trial involving more than 30,000 participants across 99 sites in the US found the vaccine was safe and effective, and protected people against Covid 94.1% of the time. Among those trial participants, 15,168 people received the vaccine and the rest received a placebo. Moderna dose 1 side-effects We used results from the vaccine’s trials to describe how likely it is for people aged 18 to 64 to experience a given side-effect within one week of a dose of the vaccine. On average, these symptoms cleared up within three days, and often less. default Moderna dose 2 side-effects A key feature of the two-dose regimen is that people are more likely to experience side-effects after the second dose. default Pfizer vaccine side-effects A vaccine developed by Pfizer with the pharmaceutical name BNT162B2 uses mRNA technology, much like Moderna’s vaccine. Their trial used 152 sites around the world. While the majority (130) were in the US, trial sites were also located in Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. More than 43,000 people were involved in the trial. The vaccine was found to be 95% effective at preventing Covid-19. Pfizer’s vaccine uses a two-dose regiment spaced 21 days apart. Pfizer dose one side-effects Unlike Moderna, Pfizer studied side-effects in two separate age groups: people between aged 16 and 55, and people older than 55. Because people older than 55 are slightly less likely to experience side-effects, the younger group is presented here. default Pfizer dose two side-effects Like the Moderna vaccine, some side-effects were more common after the second dose. default Johnson & Johnson side-effects The most recent vaccine authorized in the US is from the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen. Johnson & Johnson’s trial included more than 40,000 people across 19 geographic regions. Importantly, this included South Africa, where the vaccine was found to be slightly less effective against the B1351 variant. The FDA found this vaccine is more than 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19. While this efficacy rate is lower than the two previously discussed vaccines, it still gives near perfect protection against hospitalization and death, and provides advantages in fighting the pandemic. Johnson & Johnson side-effects The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose, has a generally lower rate of side-effects. default What causes the side-effects? Side-effects are a sign the vaccine is prompting your body to mount an immune response. They may be uncomfortable, but can also be a sign the vaccine is working as intended. Side-effects are caused by the release of chemicals in the body which signal to the immune system it is time to mount a response. These naturally occurring chemicals are called cytokines and chemokines. Though there is not a one-to-one correlation between side-effects and an immune response, side-effects are an expected part of the process. “What we look for as vaccinologists is the Goldilocks response,” said Dr Greg Poland, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Vaccine and head of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic. Poland also consults for major vaccine manufacturers. “We don’t want too little” immune response, “we don’t want too much, we want just enough,” said Poland. The balance Poland is describing is sometimes referred to as between “immunogenicity” and “reactogenicity”, or the propensity to prompt an immune response versus the tolerability of side-effects. Why should I trust this data? In vaccine science, these often mild side-effects are described as “adverse events”. In Covid-19 vaccine studies, researchers collected information on everything from hip fractures to heart attacks to monitor the safety of these vaccines. “We have a very, very robust system in the US,” to track adverse vaccine events, said Poland. “It’s how we were able to pinpoint a risk of anaphylaxis in specific kinds of people occurring at the rate of 2.4-4.5 per million, something you could never have done in this kind of timely manner in the past.” Importantly, the vast majority these side-effects are not related to vaccines, but are nevertheless documented to ensure there is not a pattern, and to verify the safety of one of the only medical interventions given to healthy people. The FDA then produces its own analysis of vaccine trials, and the data is presented to an independent panel of experts, who review it and make a recommendation on whether to authorize the vaccines based on the results. The FDA analyses presented to the committee are public, and can be viewed here, as can meetings of this expert panel.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

AP Photo/Darko BandicEditor’s note: So you’ve gotten your coronavirus vaccine, waited the two weeks for your immune system to respond to the shot and are now fully vaccinated. Does this mean you can make your way through the world like the old days without fear of spreading the virus? Deborah Fuller is a microbiologist at the University of Washington working on coronavirus vaccines. She explains what the science shows about transmission post-vaccination – and whether new variants could change this equation. 1. Does vaccination completely prevent infection? The short answer is no. You can still get infected after you’ve been vaccinated. But your chances of getting seriously ill are almost zero. Many people think vaccines work like a shield, blocking a virus from infecting cells altogether. But in most cases, a person who gets vaccinated is protected from disease, not necessarily infection. Every person’s immune system is a little different, so when a vaccine is 95% effective, that just means 95% of people who receive the vaccine won’t get sick. These people could be completely protected from infection, or they could be getting infected but remain asymptomatic because their immune system eliminates the virus very quickly. The remaining 5% of vaccinated people can become infected and get sick, but are extremely unlikely to be hospitalized. Vaccination doesn’t 100% prevent you from getting infected, but in all cases it gives your immune system a huge leg up on the coronavirus. Whatever your outcome – whether complete protection from infection or some level of disease – you will be better off after encountering the virus than if you hadn’t been vaccinated. Vaccines prevent disease, not infection. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, CC BY 2. Does infection always mean transmission? Transmission happens when enough viral particles from an infected person get into the body of an uninfected person. In theory, anyone infected with the coronavirus could potentially transmit it. But a vaccine will reduce the chance of this happening. In general, if vaccination doesn’t completely prevent infection, it will significantly reduce the amount of virus coming out of your nose and mouth – a process called shedding – and shorten the time that you shed the virus. This is a big deal. A person who sheds less virus is less likely to transmit it to someone else. This seems to be the case with coronavirus vaccines. In a recent preprint study which has yet to be peer reviewed, Israeli researchers tested 2,897 vaccinated people for signs of coronavirus infection. Most had no detectable virus, but people who were infected had one-quarter the amount of virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people tested at similar times post-infection. Less coronavirus virus means less chance of spreading it, and if the amount of virus in your body is low enough, the probability of transmitting it may reach almost zero. However, researchers don’t yet know where that cutoff is for the coronavirus, and since the vaccines don’t provide 100% protection from infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people continue to wear masks and social distance even after they’ve been vaccinated. New, more infectious and transmissible variants of the coronavirus might limit the effectiveness of current vaccines. AP Photo/John Raoux 3. What about the new coronavirus variants? New variants of coronavirus have emerged in recent months, and recent studies show that vaccines are less effective against certain ones, like the B1351 variant first identified in South Africa. Every time SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it gets new mutations. In recent months, researchers have found new variants that are more infective – meaning a person needs to breathe in less virus to become infected – and other variants that are more transmissible - meaning they increase the amount of virus a person sheds. And researchers have also found at least one new variant that seems to be better at evading the immune system, according to early data. So how does this relate to vaccines and transmission? For the South Africa variant, vaccines still provide greater than 85% protection from getting severely ill with COVID–19. But when you count mild and moderate cases, they provide, at best, only about 50%-60% protection. That means at least 40% of vaccinated people will still have a strong enough infection – and enough virus in their body – to cause at least moderate disease. If vaccinated people have more virus in their bodies and it takes less of that virus to infect another person, there will be higher probability a vaccinated person could transmit these new strains of the coronavirus. If all goes well, vaccines will very soon reduce the rate of severe disease and death worldwide. To be sure, any vaccine that reduces disease severity is also, at the population level, reducing the amount of virus being shed overall. But because of the emergence of new variants, vaccinated people still have the potential to shed and spread the coronavirus to other people, vaccinated or otherwise. This means it will likely take much longer for vaccines to reduce transmission and for populations to reach herd immunity than if these new variants had never emerged. Exactly how long that will take is a balance between how effective vaccines are against emerging strains and how transmissible and infectious these new strains are.

{'_id': '2e8ec4dfde9a2f7ad5b6bbdc9089ffd2', 'title': 'As Mask Mandates Lift, Retail Workers Again Feel Vulnerable', 'description': 'Marilyn Reece, the lead bakery clerk at a Kroger in Batesville, Mississippi, started noticing more customers walking around the store without masks this month after the state mandate to wear face coverings was repealed. Kroger still requires them, but that doesn’t seem to matter. When Reece, a 56-year-old breast-cancer survivor, sees those shoppers, she prays. “Please, please, don’t let me have to wait on them, because in my heart, I don’t want to ignore them, I don’t want to refuse them,” she said. “But then I’m thinking I don’t want to get sick and die, either. It’s not that people are bad, but you don’t know who they’ve come into contact with.” Reece’s heightened anxiety is shared by retail and fast-food workers in states like Mississippi and Texas, where governments have removed mask mandates before a majority of people have been vaccinated and while troubling new variants of the coronavirus are appearing. It feels like a return to the early days of the pandemic, when businesses said customers must wear masks but there was no legal requirement and numerous shoppers simply refused. Many workers say that their stores do not enforce the requirement, and that if they do approach customers, they risk verbal or physical altercations. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “It’s given a great false sense of security, and it’s no different now than it was a year ago,” said Reece, who is not yet able to receive a vaccine because of allergies. “The only difference we have now is people are getting vaccinated but enough people haven’t gotten vaccinated that they should have lifted the mandate.” For many people who work in retail, especially grocery stores and big-box chains, the mask repeals are another example of how little protection and appreciation they have received during the pandemic. While they were praised as essential workers, that rarely translated into extra pay on top of their low wages. Grocery employees were not initially given priority for vaccinations in most states, even as health experts cautioned the public to limit time in grocery stores because of the risk posed by new coronavirus variants. (Texas opened availability to everyone 16 and older on Monday.) The issue has gained serious prominence: On Monday, President Joe Biden called on governors and mayors to maintain or reinstate orders to wear masks as the nation grapples with a potential rise in virus cases. The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents nearly 900,000 grocery workers, said this month that at least 34,700 grocery workers around the country had been infected with or exposed to COVID-19 and that at least 155 workers had died from the virus. The recent mass shooting at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, has only rattled workers further and added to concerns about their own safety. Diane Cambre, a 50-year-old floor supervisor at a Kroger in Midlothian, Texas, said she had spent much of the past year worrying about bringing the virus home to her 9-year-old son and dreading interactions with customers who were flippant about the possibility of getting sick. She wears a double mask in the store even though it irritates her skin, already itchy from psoriasis, and changes her clothes as soon as she gets home. After Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said on March 2 that he would end the statewide mask mandate the next week, Cambre said, customers immediately “started coming in not wearing a mask and stuff, and it’s been pretty hard getting anybody to wear one.” Management is supposed to offer masks to people who aren’t wearing them, but if they don’t put them on, nothing else is done, she said. Asking customers to wear masks can result in tense exchanges and even tantrums from cart-pushing adults. “Some of our customers are drama-prone, so they’ll start yelling, ‘I’m not wearing that mask,’ and you can tell they’re very rude in their voice and very harsh,” Cambre, a UFCW member, said. Overseeing the self-checkout aisles has been especially challenging, she said, because customers who need help will demand that she come over, making it impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance. At times when she has tried to explain the need for distancing, “they say, ‘OK, and that’s just a government thing,’” she said. “It really takes a toll on you mentally.” A Kroger representative said that the chain would “continue to require everyone in our stores across the country to wear masks until all our frontline grocery associates can receive the COVID-19 vaccine,” and that it was offering $100 one-time payments to workers who received the vaccine. The differing state and business mandates have some workers worried about more confrontations. The retail industry was already trying to address the issue last fall, when a major trade group helped put together training to help workers manage and de-escalate conflicts with customers who resisted masks, social distancing and store capacity limits. Refusing service to people without masks, or asking them to leave, has led to incidents in the past year like a cashier’s being punched in the face, a Target employee’s breaking his arm and the fatal shooting of a Family Dollar security guard. This month in League City, Texas, near Houston, a 53-year-old man who refused to wear a required mask in a Jack in the Box confronted employees and then stabbed a store manager three times, according to a report in The Houston Chronicle. On March 14, a San Antonio ramen shop was vandalized with racist graffiti after its owner criticized Abbott on television for lifting the Texas mask mandate. On March 17, a 65-year-old woman was arrested in an Office Depot in Texas City after she refused to wear a mask or leave the store, just days after an arrest warrant was issued for her in Galveston, Texas, for behaving similarly in a Bank of America location. MaryAnn Kaylor, the owner of two antique stores in Dallas, including Lula B’s Design District, said the mask mandate repeal mattered a lot for stores and people’s behavior. “He should have focused more on getting people vaccinated instead of trying to open everything up,” she said of Abbott, noting that Texas has one of the country’s slowest vaccination rates. “You still have cases every day in Texas, and you have people dying still from COVID,” she said. “This complete lifting of mandates is stupid. It shouldn’t have been based on politics — it should have been based on science.” Some Texans have started to seek out mask-friendly establishments. Kaylor said that lists of Dallas businesses that require masks had been circulating on Facebook, and that people were consulting them to figure out where to buy groceries and do other shopping. Emily Francois, a sales associate at a Walmart in Port Arthur, Texas, said that customers had been ignoring signs to wear masks and that Walmart had not been enforcing the policy. So Francois stands 6 feet away from shoppers who don’t wear masks, even though that upsets some of them. “My life is more important,” she said. “I see customers coming in without a mask and they’re coughing, sneezing, they’re not covering their mouths,” said Francois, who has worked at Walmart for 14 years and is a member of United for Respect, an advocacy group. “Customers coming in the store without masks make us feel like we aren’t worthy, we aren’t safe.” Phillip Keene, a spokesman for Walmart, said that “our policy of requiring associates and customers to wear masks in our stores has helped protect them during the pandemic, and we’re not lifting those measures at this time.” Even before the pandemic, Reece, the Kroger clerk in Mississippi, was wearing a mask to protect herself from the flu because of her cancer diagnosis, she said. She said 99% of customers in her small store had worn masks during the pandemic. “When they had to put it on, they did put it on,” she said. “It’s like giving a child a piece of candy — that child is going to eat that candy unless you take it from them.” She is concerned about the potential harm from new variants, particularly from those who don’t cover their mouths. “You just have to pray and pray you don’t get within 6 feet of them, or 10 feet for that matter,” said Reece, who is also a UFCW member and has worked for Kroger for more than 30 years. “I know people want it to be back to normal, but you can’t just will it to be back to normal.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), asking her to stop the "false attacks" against the "social justice theological and faith traditions" of Rev. Raphael Warnock, her Democratic opponent.Warnock and Loeffler, who was appointed to her Senate seat in 2019 after Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons, are fighting to win one of Georgia\'s two Senate runoff races on Jan. 5. Warnock is senior pastor at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and throughout the campaign, Loeffler has tried to brand him as a "radical" liberal and "socialist," criticizing him for a 2011 sermon invoking the military and his support of women\'s reproductive rights.In their letter, the religious leaders — primarily pastors from Georgia — ask Loeffler to "cease your false attacks on Rev. Warnock\'s social justice theological and faith traditions which visualizes a just and ardent world where love, fairness, and equal justice under the law for marginalized people of all races is not only accepted as an authentic prophetic message in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King, but also a central message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ."Warnock has not said or written anything that indicates he is a "socialist" or "radical," the letter states, and the leaders see Loeffler\'s "attacks against Warnock as a broader attack against the Black church and faith traditions for which we stand."The race between Warnock and Loeffler has been filled with controversies. Earlier this month, an open letter against Warnock was released by conservative Black ministers, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Warnock also responded to criticism from two Orthodox rabbis upset over remarks he made about unarmed Palestinians being shot by Israeli soldiers, saying he is a "staunch ally and supporter of Israel."Loeffler has been scrutinized for selling stocks at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, when she received confidential information during Senate briefings. She has also spread baseless claims about election fraud in Georgia, supported President Trump\'s attempt to overturn the election results, and posed for a photo during a rally with Chester Doles, a white supremacist and former KKK leader who marched in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Loeffler\'s campaign later said she didn\'t know who he was, and otherwise would have removed him from the event.More stories from theweek.com  Trump is reportedly meeting with Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, asking about martial law idea  7 feel-good cartoons about the COVID vaccine breakthrough  5 insanely funny cartoons about Trump\'s election-fraud failure', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Trump might have other ideas.', 'description': 'In a two-page memo addressed to GOP donors, voters, leaders, and activists, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) declared: "The Republican Civil War is now canceled." It isn\'t clear if his fellow Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, are listening. Scott is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and in the memo, first obtained by Fox News, he writes that Democrats control the White House, Senate, and House, but Republicans have a path to victory in 2022. To win, the GOP must move on from the "impeachment show" and stop with the infighting, he said, adding that a Republican Civil War "does not need to be true, should not be true, and will not be true." While Scott wants unity, not all Republicans are on the same page. After Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican, voted to impeach Trump last month, she was censured by the Wyoming Republican Party and asked to resign. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) voted to acquit Trump, but still said there is "no question that former President Trump bears responsibility" for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. This remark roused Trump, who had been flying under the radar during the trial. He called McConnell a "dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack," and said if Republican senators "are going to stay with him, they will not win again. Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again." Three GOP senators are retiring in 2022 — Richard Burr (N.C.), Pat Toomey (Pa.), and Rob Portman (Ohio) — and Scott has said the NRSC will support the remaining incumbents from primary challenges. Trump is letting people know he isn\'t done with McConnell, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted Tuesday. Last week, Trump and former Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) met for golf and dinner, and people briefed on the day told Haberman "it did not go well." Trump reportedly had "retribution" on his mind, and was focused on McConnell and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who did not go along with Trump\'s plot to overturn Georgia\'s election results. Perdue had been contemplating running again in 2022, but said Tuesday he won\'t. Although no longer in office, Trump still has the support of a majority of Republicans. A Suffolk University/USA Today poll of 1,000 Trump supporters conducted last week found that 46 percent would ditch the Republican Party and join a Trump party if he started one, with 27 percent saying they wouldn\'t and the rest undecided. A majority said they had more loyalty to Trump than the GOP, and 50 percent said the Republican Party should become "more loyal to Trump."

{'_id': '4387705503244cc29ef0ee49eaada5bb', 'title': 'The Long Darkness Before Dawn', 'description': 'Each week, good news about vaccines or antibody treatments surfaces, offering hope that an end to the pandemic is at hand.And yet this holiday season presents a grim reckoning. The United States has reached an appalling milestone: more than 1 million new coronavirus cases every week. Hospitals in some states are full to bursting. The number of deaths is rising and seems on track to easily surpass the 2,200-a-day average in the spring, when the pandemic was concentrated in the New York metropolitan area.Our failure to protect ourselves has caught up to us.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe nation now must endure a critical period of transition, one that threatens to last far too long, as we set aside justifiable optimism about next spring and confront the dark winter ahead. Some public health researchers predict that the death toll by March could be close to twice the 250,000 figure that the nation surpassed only last week."The next three months are going to be just horrible," said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University\'s School of Public Health and one of two dozen experts interviewed by The New York Times about the near future.This juncture, perhaps more than any to date, exposes the deep political divisions that have allowed the pandemic to take root and bloom, and that will determine the depth of the winter ahead. Even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to avoid holiday travel and many health officials asked families to cancel big gatherings, more than 6 million Americans took flights during Thanksgiving week, which is about 40% of last year\'s air traffic. And President Donald Trump, the one person most capable of altering the trajectory between now and spring, seems unwilling to help his successor do what must be done to save the lives of tens of thousands of Americans.President-elect Joe Biden has assembled excellent advisers and a sensible plan for tackling the pandemic, public health experts said. But Mitchell Warren, the founder of AVAC, an AIDS advocacy group that focuses on several diseases, said Biden\'s hands appear tied until Inauguration Day on Jan. 20: "There\'s not a ton of power in being president-elect."By late December, the first doses of vaccine may be available to Americans, federal officials have said. Priorities are still being set, but vaccinations are expected to go first to health care workers, nursing home residents and others at highest risk. How long it will take to reach younger Americans depends on many factors, including how many vaccines are approved and how fast they can be made.But even as the medical response to the virus is improving, the politics of public health remain a deeply vexing challenge.The regions of the country now among those hit hardest by the virus -- Midwestern and Mountain States and rural counties, including in the Dakotas, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming -- are the ones that voted heavily for Trump in the recent election. The president could help save his millions of supporters by urging them to wear masks, avoid crowds and skip holiday gatherings this year. But that seemed unlikely to occur, many health experts said."That is outside of his DNA," said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University medical school. "It would mean admitting he was wrong and Tony Fauci was right."The antidote to hopelessness is agency, and Americans can protect themselves by wearing masks and keeping their distance from others."There is pretty broad support for mask mandates even among Republicans," said Martha Louise Lincoln, a medical historian at San Francisco State University. "But among extreme right-wing voters there\'s still a perception that they\'re a sign of weakness or a symbol of being duped."A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimated that 130,000 lives could be saved by February if mask use became universal in the United States immediately. Masks can also preserve the economy: A study by Goldman Sachs estimated that universal use would save $1 trillion that may be lost to business shutdowns and medical bills.Biden has said that he intends to tackle the pandemic from his first full day in office, on Jan. 21. But because coronavirus deaths follow new cases by some weeks, any results of his actions may not be apparent before early spring.The experts generally praised the panel of advisers chosen by Biden, depicting them as reputable scientists who could credibly reach out to many groups hard-hit by the pandemic, including Black and Hispanic Americans.But several experts, some of whom spoke anonymously to avoid offending friends and colleagues, said the panel needed different skills and a different kind of balance.Some felt that it should have more scientific expertise, and suggested recruiting more vaccinologists, such as Dr. Paul A. Offit of Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, and more public health researchers, such as Harvard\'s Marc Lipsitch and Natalie E. Dean of the University of Florida.Others said the panel needed more behavioral scientists adept at fighting rumors, which have been a major obstacle."We\'re facing extremely complex and poorly understood dynamics around disinformation, conspiratorial theories, paranoia and mistrust," Lincoln noted.Among the suggested names with those skills were Heidi J. Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project in London, Carl T. Bergstrom of the University of Washington and Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina.Warren suggested consulting marketing experts and recruiting "everyone from Santa Claus to LeBron James" as trusted spokespersons.Another expert suggested adding Dr. Mehmet Oz, a heart surgeon and television personality who was criticized for promoting hydroxychloroquine on Fox News (he later relented), and possibly even asking Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson to join, because they are popular with Trump\'s base and might be persuaded to accept science that would save the lives of their own viewers.Biden\'s plan for tackling the pandemic is outlined on his website. It calls for far more widespread testing, delivered free; a ban on out-of-pocket costs for medical care for the virus; having the military build temporary hospitals if necessary; cooperation with American businesses to create more personal protective gear and ventilators; more food relief for the poor, and other measures.All the experts interviewed by the Times praised the plan, but several felt it was not aggressive enough. The pandemic is raging so far beyond control, they argued, that it can be contained only with deeply unpopular but necessary measures, such as rigorously enforced mask laws, closing bars and restaurants, requiring regular testing in schools and workplaces, isolating the infected away from their families, prohibiting travel from high-prevalence areas to low ones, and imposing quarantines that are enforced rather than merely requested.Many other countries have imposed such measures despite fierce opposition from some citizens, they said, and they have helped.Biden will inherit the fruits of Operation Warp Speed and oversee their distribution. Members of his transition team, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to reveal its deliberations, said they were already discussing two sensitive topics: whether to create a secure way for vaccinated individuals to prove they have received both shots, and whether COVID vaccines should ultimately be made mandatory -- either by the federal government, or by state governments, employers, school systems or the like.The next dozen weeks will be long and painful. But spring is likely to bring highly effective vaccines and a renewed commitment to medical leadership, something that has been missing under Trump."The CDC will have to be rebuilt, and its guidelines and the FDA\'s have to be promptly reevaluated," said Dr. Robert L. Murphy, director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University\'s medical school. "The Biden team will move quickly. It\'s not like they don\'t know what to do."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

And though they were later able to legally marry—on the steps of a San Francisco courthouse, no less—they always considered that first meeting their anniversary.So on March 7, 2020, even as the coronavirus had already begun turning cruise ships into disaster zones in Japan and Australia, the pair boarded the MS Zandaam in Buenos Aires, Argentina, hoping for the best.From their home in Nashville, 70-year-old Lindsay told The Daily Beast on Friday that things went downhill fast.“We were not sure if we would make it home alive,” he said, as the ship became overrun with COVID-19, ports began denying the cruise entry, and his husband got sick.From Lobsters and Steak to Coronavirus: One Couple’s Surreal Cruise NightmareLindsay described how, as a retired nurse, he tried to tend to his husband, who was five years his senior. But at some point, he said, “Carl just wasn’t getting any better.”Eventually, 75-year-old Zehner was lifted onto a helicopter and flown to a hospital in Orlando, where he was put on a ventilator for 27 days, Lindsay recalled. Zehner spent 70 days in the hospital, losing more than 30 pounds, according to the couple. They spoke on the phone and in Facetime calls until they were allowed to meet in person.“One time, when he still couldn’t speak, he wrote on a whiteboard, ‘I want to die,’” Lindsay told The Daily Beast.In June, the couple filed a $5-million federal class-action lawsuit in the Western District of Washington at Seattle, claiming that “as a direct and proximate result” of negligence and gross negligence by Holland America and its parent company, Carnival, Zehner “was exposed to and suffered from COVID-19,” and that he “continues to suffer from the effects of this illness” many months later.In the course of the lawsuit, documents released via federal open records laws and obtained by The Daily Beast have revealed communications between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Carnival, showing how the cruise handled the infections on board. The documents paint a picture of confusion and panic as the scale of the outbreak came into focus, and how health officials and industry players butted heads over an emerging disaster that would soon wreak unprecedented havoc on the mainland United States.The communiques also appear to show that the ship waited days to impose a quarantine after symptoms of COVID-19 were first reported onboard, that they wanted to send asymptomatic passengers home on commercial flights despite repeated warnings from the CDC on the subject, and that there was not enough medical equipment on board—specifically oxygen—to handle an outbreak of a contagious respiratory virus with a majority of elderly passengers.The couple’s attorney, Kenny Byrd, said the 178 pages of documents, which have not previously been reported, display examples of “outrageous misconduct.” Most remarkably, they indicate, in what appear to be notes from a call with Dr. Grant Tarling, Chief Medical Officer for Carnival, taken by the CDC’s Dr. Cindy Friedman, that there were reports of symptoms among both passengers and crew members as early as March 18—and that it wasn’t until a surge on March 21 that the ship decided to implement a quarantine, beginning the next day.“On 3/ 18 started getting reports of ILI among pax and crew,” the notes by Friedman read. “On 3/22 All guests quarantined cabins and room svc - activities cancelled… Not many spare cabins so they are cohorting crew to sick cabins and well cabins.”According to Lawrence Gostin, an expert on public health law at Georgetown University, “Waiting several days before initiating a quarantine can be disastrous. During the lag time, there is likely to be cascading spread.”In response to questions about the revelations in the documents, Erik Elvejord, Director of Public Relations from Holland America, told The Daily Beast, “Holland America Line appreciates the difficulties faced by so many as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our response throughout this process has been focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this illness. We do not comment on any pending litigation.”Tarling, the medical officer, and Carnival, Holland’s parent company, did not respond to a request for comment.The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global health emergency on Jan. 30, upgrading it to a “global pandemic” on March 11—a move some criticized at the time for coming later than it should have. Cruise ships in particular had already emerged as hot spots.“Outbreaks of any type are a risk on cruises because a large number of people spend time in close contact with travelers and crew from many locations around the globe,” Dr. Jennifer Horney, founding director and professor in the University of Delaware’s epidemiology program, told The Daily Beast.Still, the couple claimed in their lawsuit that before they boarded the ship in Buenos Aires, Holland America touted the company’s “deep partnerships with global health experts” and “enhanced screening, prevention and control procedures.”‘First in the Room, Back of the Line’: Doctors Revolt Over Stanford’s ‘Absurd’ Vaccine RolloutThe lawsuit also cites the case of the Diamond Princess cruise, operated by Carnival, which began in February and was at one point the largest COVID-19 outbreak outside of China, infecting 712 people and killing nine. The lawsuit stated that 1,500 positive COVID-19 infections and almost 40 deaths were ultimately linked to cruises operated by Carnival or its subsidiaries.The CDC has since said that more than 250 people “reported illness consistent with \xadCOVID-19” on the Zaandam and its sister cruise, the Rotterdam, which took on some of the passengers of the Zaandam after the outbreak began. But Holland America has never revealed how many people were tested for the disease.“We were told the cruise would be subject to pre-boarding health reporting and enhanced screening at check-in,” Lindsay told The Daily Beast. “We have been on dozens of cruises together, and they operated just like all the prior ones—except this time they were aware a pandemic was raging on their other ships.”The day they boarded, however, their temperatures were not checked, the lawsuit claims. As the outbreak worsened, the cruise stopped in Montevideo, Uruguay, and then the Falkland Islands. It canceled its itinerary and turned “north” on March 15 when many South American ports closed to cruise ship traffic, Business Insider reported.“We’re now on a mystery cruise because we have no idea where we're going,” an American passenger told the publication at the time.About a week later, the captain announced the death of “four older Zandaam guests,” according to an audio recording provided to Business Insider. Two of those guests were later confirmed to have COVID-19.The documents obtained by FOIA also include mention—in Friedman’s notes—of one 75-year-old citizen of the United Kingdom who was intubated on board, which apparently concerned Tarling, the Carnival medical officer, because the ship had only 11 oxygen cylinders—and that patient was “using up much of the 02 supply.”Gov. Ron DeSantis’ Very Own MAGA Superspreader?As countries denied the ship entry and passengers got sicker, the correspondence took on a more ominous tone.In an April 1 email from Friedman to Chief Maritime Officer of Carnival Corp, William Burke, she reiterated that the ship should send “symptomatic patients, who are medically able to travel, back to their homes as soon as possible by private transport.”But, Friedman said, “They should not travel with well passengers, nor by commercial conveyance.”Burke and Friedman went back and forth several times about the company’s plan to send people home on commercial flights, with Friedman writing that “CDC recommends that all passengers not travel commercially.”Wrote Burke, “Doctor, the guidance we have says CDC recommends that only for symptomatic people. You were clear on the call the other day that commercial travel is fine for well people, face masks as a precaution.”In any case, by April 3, John Haeflinger, Senior Vice President of Maritime Policy and Analysis for Carnival, wrote that the company had pulled passengers slated to travel on commercial planes and were working on “alternative repatriation options.”Friedman, Burke, and Haeflinger did not respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast on Friday.If the communications in the documents reflected a concerted desire to send home asymptomatic passengers on commercial flights without first testing them for the virus, Gostin said, it would be “scandalous and utterly irresponsible.”> Do you know something we should about the coronavirus, or how your government, school, or business is responding to it? Email Olivia.Messer@TheDailyBeast.com or securely at olivia.messer@protonmail.com from a non-work device.That said, experts know much more today than they did in March about the reality of asymptomatic transmission, and how the virus spreads more generally.As Dr. Horney put it, “one of the major challenges with COVID since the beginning has been asymptomatic transmission,” especially in the days when diagnostic kits were much more limited, as they were in March.“Now that testing is widely available, asymptomatic cases can more easily be identified,” said Horney. “No one who is positive or a close contact should be traveling.”While Carnival has so far declined to publicly comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, in a complex, 34-page motion to dismiss the case filed in October, the company argued, “In these extremely uncertain and unprecedented circumstances—at the very outset of a pandemic that still remains out of control—defendants’ conduct was not ‘outrageous’ as a matter of law.”As for future cruises? In October, the CDC lifted its “no sail” order on American cruise ships and set out a stringent framework for how cruising could begin again, and cruise lines will only be allowed to start passenger operations once they meet all requirements and are granted a conditional COVID-19 safety certificate issued by the agency itself. Most cruise lines said in the fall that they would be using the rest of the year to adapt to those orders and planned to open to passengers in 2021.Suffice it to say that Lindsay and Zehner will not be among them.Now, on Saturday mornings in Nashville, the pair eat eggs and toast for breakfast and play bridge for a few hours. Then Lindsay takes a nap, with their pet bird resting on his leg, while Zehner “putzes around with his phone.”When possible, they try to forget the cruise, which Lindsay calls “a nightmare,” one still festering even as the coronavirus vaccine begins to roll out and Americans long for a return to normal.“It’s not one you want to have,” he added.—With reporting by Ana Lucía MurilloRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

However, in a new interview with NBC News, Pfizer’s CEO is now saying that a third shot may be necessary to achieve full protection. Read on to discover why you might need to get a third shot, and for more vaccination news, check out This Other Vaccine Could Already Be Protecting You From COVID, Study Says. You may need a third booster shot to address emerging mutations. During an interview with NBC News\'s Lester Holt, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla explained that by adding an additional third booster shot to the recommended two-dose vaccine, individuals will have greater protection against the highly infectious COVID variants that have recently been identified. “We believe that the third dose will raise the antibody response 10- to 20- fold,” said Bourla.Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten, MD, told Reuters recently, "The rate of mutations in the current virus is higher than expected. It’s a reasonable probability that we would end up with regular boosts."A preprint of a January study by BioNTech, which worked with Pfizer to create the vaccine, found that the doses are effective against the B.1.1.7. variant from the U.K., which is projected to become the dominant strain in the U.S. in March. But that may not be true with all mutations of the virus. For example, a February report from Pfizer and BioNTech, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the South African variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by approximately two-thirds.To prevent future widespread coronavirus infections, Pfizer plans to test the efficacy of modified versions of the company’s existing vaccine against mutations, starting with the South African variant. And if you want to know more about the latest vaccine, These Are the Side Effects of the New Johnson&Johnson Vaccine, FDA Says. These booster shots will likely become available quicker than the initial vaccine. Though it may have taken the better part of a year for the COVID vaccine to become available in the U.S., developing future boosters to address coronavirus mutants shouldn’t take quite as long. On Feb. 22, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that vaccine companies could potentially file for Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for future coronavirus vaccines instead of conducting additional large-scale clinical trials. “In the case of investigational vaccines being developed for the prevention of COVID-19, any assessment regarding an EUA will be made on a case by case basis,” the FDA statement read. And for more vaccine advice from the nation\'s top agencies, check out The CDC Says Don’t Do This Within 2 Weeks of Your COVID Vaccine. The third shot will likely be the same brand as the first one or two you get. Pfizer is currently studying the efficacy of administering a third shot, and in a statement this week, Moderna said the company is also "evaluating booster doses of vaccine to increase neutralizing immunity against the variants of concern," including the South African variant. (Additionally, the single-dose vaccine from Johnson&Johnson, which should be approved for emergency use by the FDA this week, has proven to be quite effective in clinical trials in South Africa itself, where it was 82 percent against severe disease.) As is the case with your first and second doses, your booster will likely be from the same company as your initial vaccinations.While the precise timeframe for the most effective administration of the third shot has not yet been definitively determined, the time elapsed between participants\' first shot and their booster in the latest Pfizer trials is six months to a year, NBC News reports. And for the latest COVID news delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter. You may need to get a new COVID vaccine every year. While getting your initial COVID vaccinations—whether it\'s one, two, or maybe now even three—is a good first step toward getting the pandemic under control, Bourla explained that it likely won’t be a one-and-done deal. "Every year, you need to go to get your flu vaccine. It\'s going to be the same with COVID,” said Bourla.

The case opens wide to interpretation, becoming a study in the learn-as-you-go bioethics of the country’s stumbling vaccine rollout. Late last month, a judge dismissed the charge as groundless, after which the local district attorney vowed to present the matter to a grand jury. And while prosecutors portray the doctor as a cold opportunist, his lawyer says he acted responsibly — even heroically. “Everybody was looking at this guy and saying, ‘I got my mother waiting for a vaccine, my grandfather waiting for a vaccine,’” the lawyer, Paul Doyle, said. “They were thinking, ‘This guy is a villain.’” Gokal, 48, immigrated from Pakistan as a boy and earned a medical degree at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. After working at hospitals in Central New York, he moved to Texas in 2009 to oversee the emergency department at a suburban Houston hospital. His volunteer work has included rebuilding homes and providing medical care after Hurricane Harvey in 2017. In recent years, Gokal split his time between two area hospitals. But when the pandemic hit in early 2020, he lived for a month in a hotel and an apartment rather than risk infecting his wife, Maria, 47, who has pulmonary sarcoidosis, a disease in her lungs that leaves her winded after even minimal activity. “I was petrified to go home and bring COVID to my wife,” he said. Fortunately, he said, the Harris County Public Health department recruited him in April to become the medical director for its COVID-response team. The job paid less, but he was eager to protect his wife by limiting his exposure to the coronavirus in emergency rooms. On Dec. 22, Gokal joined a conference call in which state health officials explained the protocols for administering the recently approved Moderna vaccine. The 10 or 11 doses in a vial are viable for six hours after the seal is punctured. Gokal said the advice was to vaccinate people eligible under the 1(a) category (health care workers and residents in long-term-care facilities), then those under the 1(b) category (people over 65 or with a health condition that increases risk of severe COVID-related illness). After that, he said, the message was: “Just put it in people’s arms. We don’t want any doses to go to waste. Period.” On Dec. 29, a mild Tuesday, Gokal arrived before dawn at a park in the Houston suburb of Humble to supervise a vaccination event intended mostly for emergency workers. In part because of minimal publicity, the pace was slow, with no more than 250 doses administered. But this was the county’s first public event, he said. “We knew there would be hiccups.” Around 6:45 at night, as the event wound down, an eligible person arrived for a shot. A nurse punctured a new vial to administer the vaccine, which activated the six-hour time limit for the 10 remaining doses. The chances of 10 eligible people suddenly showing up were slim; by now, workers were offsetting the darkness with car headlights. But Gokal said he was determined not to waste a single dose. He said he first asked the event’s 20 or so workers, who either refused or had already been vaccinated. The paramedics on site had left, and of the two police officers, one had been vaccinated and the other declined the doctor’s offer. Gokal said he called a Harris County public health official in charge of operations to report his plans to find 10 people to receive the remaining doses. He said he was told, simply: OK. He said he then called another high-ranking colleague whose parents and in-laws were eligible for the vaccine. They weren’t available. The hours were counting down. The doctor figured that if he returned the open vial to his department’s almost certainly empty office at this late hour, it would go to waste. So as he started the drive to his home in a neighboring county, he said, he called people in his cellphone’s contact list to ask whether they had older relatives or neighbors needing to be immunized. “No one I was really intimately familiar with,” Gokal said. “I wasn’t that close to anyone.” When he reached his home in Sugar Land, waiting outside were a woman in her mid-60s with cardiac issues, and a woman in her early 70s with assorted health problems. He inoculated both. Eight doses to go. The doctor got back in his car — his wife insisted on going with him — and drove to a Sugar Land house with four eligible people: a man in his late 60s with health issues; the man’s bed-bound mother, in her 90s; his mother-in-law, in her mid-80s and with severe dementia; and his wife, her mother’s caregiver. He then drove to the home of a housebound woman in her late 70s and administered the vaccine. “I didn’t know her at all,” he said. Three doses remained, but three people had agreed to meet the doctor at his home. Two were already waiting: a distant acquaintance in her mid-50s who works at a health clinic’s front desk, and a 40-ish woman he had never met whose child relies on a ventilator. As midnight approached, Gokal said, the third would-be recipient called to say that he wouldn’t be coming: too late. Tired and frustrated, Gokal said that he turned to his wife, whose pulmonary sarcoidosis made her eligible for the vaccine. “I didn’t intend to give this to you, but in a half-hour I’m going to have to dump this down the toilet,” he recalled telling her. “It’s as simple as that.” He said his hesitant wife asked whether it was the right thing to do. “It makes perfect sense,” he said he answered. “We don’t want any doses wasted, period.” With 15 minutes to spare, Gokal gave his wife the last Moderna dose. The next morning, he said, he submitted the paperwork for the 10 people he had vaccinated the previous night, including his wife. He said he also informed his supervisor and colleagues of what he had done, and why. Several days later, the doctor said, that supervisor and the human resources director summoned him to ask whether he had administered 10 doses outside the scheduled event on Dec. 29. He said he had, in keeping with guidelines not to waste the vaccine — and was promptly fired. The officials maintained that he had violated protocol and should have returned the remaining doses to the office or thrown them away, the doctor recalled. He also said that one of the officials startled him by questioning the lack of “equity” among those he had vaccinated. “Are you suggesting that there were too many Indian names in that group?” Gokal said he asked. Exactly, he said he was told. Elizabeth Perez, the director of communications for Harris County Public Health, said the department was unable to comment on its protocols, the Dec. 29 vaccination event or the Gokal case. On Jan. 21, about two weeks after the doctor’s termination, a friend called to say that a local reporter had just tweeted about him. At that very moment, one of his three children answered the door to bright lights and a thrust microphone. Shaken, the 16-year-old boy closed the door and said, “Dad, there are people out there with cameras.” This was how Gokal learned that he had been charged with stealing vaccine doses. Harris County’s district attorney, Kim Ogg, had just issued a news release that afternoon with the headline: “Fired Harris County Health Doctor Charged With Stealing Vial Of Covid-19 Vaccine.” It alleged that Gokal “stole the vial” and disregarded county protocols to ensure that vaccines are not wasted and are administered to eligible people on a waiting list. “He abused his position to place his friends and family in line in front of people who had gone through the lawful process to be there,” Ogg said. But Gokal said that no one from the district attorney’s office had ever contacted him to hear his version of events. And when his lawyer requested copies of the written protocols and waiting list referred to in the complaint, a prosecutor told him by email that there were no written protocols from late December; nor had a written waitlist yet been found. Harris County had received the vaccine faster than anticipated, the email said, and public health officials “immediately jumped from testing to vaccinating.” As news of his alleged crime spread, Gokal heard from relatives and friends in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and his home country, Pakistan. “Many were calling me for support, telling me, ‘We know you better than that,’” he said. “But there were a lot of people who didn’t call.” Days later, a criminal court judge, Franklin Bynum, dismissed the case for lack of probable cause. “In the number of words usually taken to describe an allegation of retail shoplifting, the State attempts, for the first time, to criminalize a doctor’s documented administration of vaccine doses during a public health emergency,” he wrote. “The Court emphatically rejects this attempted imposition of the criminal law on the professional decisions of a physician.” Both the Texas Medical Association and the Harris County Medical Society recently issued a statement of support for physicians like Gokal who find themselves scrambling “to avoid wasting the vaccine in a punctured vial.” “It is difficult to understand any justification for charging any well-intentioned physician in this situation with a criminal offense,” the statement said. Dane Schiller, the district attorney’s director of communications, declined to answer questions about the case. He said in an email that when the matter is presented to a grand jury, “representatives of the community can vote on whether an indictment is warranted.” Meanwhile, Gokal said, he continues to pay a price for not wasting a vaccine in a pandemic. His voice broke as he counted the toll. He lost his job. His wife struggles to sleep. His children are worried. And hospitals have told him not to come back until his case is resolved. He spends his time volunteering at a nonprofit health clinic for the uninsured, haunted all the while by the realization that no matter what, it will still be out there: the story about that Pakistani doctor in Houston who stole all those vaccines. “How can I take it back?” that doctor asked.

If recent trends there are any indication, the rest of the country may be in trouble. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Florida has been steadily rising, though hospitalizations and deaths are still down. Over the past week, the state has averaged nearly 5,000 cases per day, an increase of 8% from its average two weeks earlier. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times B.1.1.7, the more contagious variant first identified in Britain, is also rising exponentially in Florida, where it accounts for a greater proportion of total cases than in any other state, according to numbers collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Wherever we have exponential growth, we have the expectation of a surge in cases, and a surge in cases will lead to hospitalizations and deaths,” said Bill Hanage, a public health researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Florida has had one of the country’s most confusing and inefficient vaccination campaigns and has fully vaccinated about 15% of its population — well below what top states, like New Mexico and South Dakota, have managed. Still, immunization of older people and other high-risk individuals may blunt the number of Florida’s deaths somewhat. The state has announced it will start offering the vaccine to anyone older than 18 on April 5. At least some of the cases in Florida are the result of the state’s open invitation to tourists. Hordes of students on spring break have descended on the state since mid-February. Rowdy crowds on Miami Beach this month forced officials to impose an 8 p.m. curfew, although many people still flouted the rules. Miami-Dade County, which includes Miami Beach, has experienced one of the nation’s worst outbreaks and continues to record high numbers. The county averaged more than 1,100 cases per day over the past week. In Orange County, cases are on the rise among young people. People 45 and younger account for 1 in 3 hospitalizations for COVID, and the average age for new infections has dropped to 30. Gov. Ron DeSantis has rejected stringent restrictions from the very start of the pandemic. Florida has never had a mask mandate, and in September DeSantis banned local governments from enforcing mandates of their own. Among his scientific advisers now are architects of the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for political leaders to allow the coronavirus to spread naturally among young people, while the elderly and those with underlying conditions sheltered in place.

Ellis, an attorney who has been working side-by-side with Giuliani in Trump\'s legal challenges to the results of the election, also reportedly attended a White House senior staff Christmas party on Friday, raising fears among some of another White House superspreader event. Ellis and Giuliani have also barnstormed a series of legislative meetings over the past two weeks to promote unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the November election and to urge state lawmakers in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan to step in and declare Trump the winner in those states. GIULIANI: "I don\'t want you to do this if you feel uncomfortable, but would you be comfortable taking your mask off so that people can hear you more clearly?" After news broke on Sunday of Giuliani\'s positive test, the Arizona state legislature said it would close both chambers this week out of caution "for recent cases and concerns relating to COVID-19."  On Tuesday, Giuliani\'s son said on Twitter the 76-year-old former New York City mayor has improved significantly and continues to work. A source said on Tuesday that Giuliani will attend a virtual hearing this week with Georgia lawmakers over Trump\'s floundering campaign to overturn his election loss.  TRUMP: "Uh, we won in those swing states."  At a coronavirus vaccine summit in Washington, Trump repeated his false claim that he won the election and called on state officials and members of the Supreme Court to help him. TRUMP: "Now, let\'s see whether or not somebody has the courage, whether it\'s a legislator or legislatures or whether it\'s a justice of the Supreme Court or a number of justices of the Supreme Court, let\'s see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right." But just a few hours after his appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court handed Trump yet another defeat in a one-sentence order with no noted dissents, refusing a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to block the state from formalizing President-elect Joe Biden\'s victory there. Tuesday also marked "safe harbor" day, a deadline under U.S. election law for states to certify presidential election results, making Trump\'s dwindling hopes of overturning his loss even more improbable. Giuliani and Ellis played down the deadline in a joint statement, signaling they would continue with legal challenges into January, saying: "The only fixed day in the U.S. Constitution is the inauguration of the President on January 20 at noon."', 'num_of_covid': 1}

And no one working on the federal response to the coronavirus is quite sure why.Members of President Joe Biden’s coronavirus task force have spent their first days in office working overtime to find an answer to this puzzle. So far, one hasn’t emerged.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 41.4 million doses have been handed out to the states. Only 21.8 million have been administered. Officials say they think there is a vaccine surplus, although how large of one is unclear. Bottom line: Doses should be flowing, they said But instead, states are complaining of vaccine shortages.Task force members rechecked the numbers—local and federal data— this week to try to discover the cause. They looked at whether there was enough being manufactured to fill demand; where that vaccine had been shipped and who had received it; how much was still sitting waiting to be administered; and how many doses were still sitting in warehouses. They’ve still come up short, officials tell The Daily Beast, in part because the data sets they are working with are incomplete.“What we are seeing now is incredible inefficiencies. You have cities canceling vaccination appointments while the data says they still haven’t administered a large portion of the vaccine that’s been shipped to them. That is the biggest problem,” said Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency doctor at New York Presbyterian Hospital.In the weeks leading up to the inauguration, officials working with Biden’s coronavirus transition task force assumed that the low vaccination rates were due in part to a lag in states reporting to the CDC. The actual vaccination rates were far higher than those reflected on the federal government’s dashboard, the officials believed. They also calculated that some states were struggling to administer the vaccine efficiently because of staff shortages and, in some regions, because of a hesitancy among residents to sign up for the shot. The idea was that as states began to work out the kinks in reporting and distribution, rates would rise and supply would eventually meet demand.Officials say they still believe all of that to be true. But the picture is even more muddled, and more complex, than they thought.According to two officials working on the administration’s vaccine effort, some state officials, including in those states reporting vaccine shortages, have determined there might be additional doses in their jurisdiction—outside of their second-dose reserves— that are unaccounted for. But those state officials do not know whether those doses are sitting in warehouses, freezers or in other distribution hubs, or whether they have been used but unreported. In other words, there could be perhaps millions of doses across the country missing in the distribution system, officials said. There could be a number of explanations to explain the discrepancies; some doses could have expired or been contaminated or otherwise destroyed, though those scenarios are rare.In response to a question about the discrepancy between states reporting shortages and the CDC alluding to the fact that there is a glut in vaccine doses across the country, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, said in a press conference that it would be “disturbing” if doses were found “laying around.”The underlying issue seems even more daunting and perhaps more difficult to remedy, according to those same two Biden officials and two other individuals who worked with the Biden transition. There are massive inefficiencies on the city, county, state, and federal levels. There isn’t just one—or two or three or four—problems with the vaccine distribution process, officials said; there are dozens. And finding solutions to those problems will require a level of communication and coordination between the federal government and states that hasn’t existed since the pandemic hit.Some cities lack comprehensive reporting systems to track where vaccines are located, whether there is adequate freezer storage, and whether doses are expiring on the shelf. And some states are having difficulty ensuring each distribution hub has enough vaccine supply for the appointments scheduled, in part because major cities in that state have their own separate distribution plan and tracking processes. Finally, some doses are getting held up as shipping companies are confused about which packages go where.Streamlining the distribution will take time, officials said. But the clock is ticking. Not only is there a political imperative—President Biden repeatedly laid out a goal of 100 million shots in the first 100 days—but the CDC has said that it expects a more contagious variant of COVID-19 to spread throughout the U.S. in the next several months. While health experts say the vaccine should work against that variant, the Biden administration wants to get as many Americans vaccinated as possible as a way to prevent another spike in COVID-related deaths this spring.‘Worse Than We Imagined’: Team Trump Left Biden a COVID NightmareCDC Officials Urge Biden Team to Dump Palantir’s COVID Tracker “There are real implications of this delay which is why we need to do this as quickly as possible. What I want to hear is that you’re willing to get every dose out and in someone’s arms. We can’t increase Pfizer or Moderna supply right now,” Spencer told The Daily Beast. “It’s going to take months.”After more than a week of calling on the federal government to send additional vaccine doses, hospitals, doctors’ offices, and pharmacies across the country late last week sent out notifications alerting thousands of Americans that they would have to cancel first-dose COVID-19 vaccinations due to a lack of supply.The U.S. vaccine rate is beginning to improve, but the mass cancellations prompted state leaders in states such as New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and California to speak out publicly about their shortages and the need for the federal government to do more to help. It was a familiar tone—one put to the Trump administration by governors who said they lacked testing and medical supplies and personal protective equipment needed to contain the spread of the virus. “The supply that we’re going to get next week is already 30,000 doses underneath our ability of what we can put in someone’s arm in just a seven-day span,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a press conference Jan. 20. Kentucky has begun canceling some vaccine appointments due to the shortage. According to the CDC’s vaccine tracker, the state has received 471,000 vaccine doses but has only administered 299,493. According to data gathered by The Washington Post, the doses that Kentucky has administered has covered just 24.8 percent of the prioritized population.Although governors across the country are dealing with increasingly frustrated and disheartened constituents, some of whom have had their vaccine appointments canceled over the last two weeks because of shortages, officials with the Biden COVID-19 task force say they’re not too concerned about the supply issue. At least not yet.“It’s better to have the demand… to have vaccine sitting on shelves even if there are lines and queues, than to have people not wanting to sign up and take it,” one individual working on the administration’s vaccine effort said, adding that the Biden team expects supply and demand to swing back and forth over the coming months as the country recalibrates the distribution process.Officials point to the decision made earlier this month to widen the pool of those who could receive the vaccine as a reason for the increase in demand for the shot. The Biden team and the outgoing Trump administration made the decision that they would recommend states allow individuals 65 and older and outside of the first wave of vaccine eligibility—people other than health-care, frontline workers and nursing home residents—receive the shot if they wanted. But officials say there was never a reserve of doses, even those the Trump administration said it had set aside as second-dose shots, to help states handle the increasing number of people signing up for vaccine appointments. In an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt Jan. 15 that the U.S. did not have a reserve stockpile.States weren’t made aware of the reserve issue until it was too late—until they had scheduled hundreds of thousands of additional vaccine appointments.Meanwhile, distribution hubs across the country were creating rules about who should and could get the vaccination and when on the fly. According to an individual who worked in one of New York City’s distribution hubs, volunteers did not ask for identification and sometimes forgot to ask for appointment confirmation. Volunteers at this particular hub rotated on a daily basis, this person said, and often received little instruction about how to run the distribution process. “We were just reinventing the wheel every day.”Two individuals who spoke to The Daily Beast said they found a primary care health-care office in Jersey City, New Jersey where they could receive their first dose even though they were residents of New York.In Fairfax, Virginia, a vaccine volunteer said his staff last week made the decision to hand out the shot to not only those who had made appointments but also anyone who accompanied those individuals to the distribution site.It’s that lack of communication, and each state approaching the decision to vaccinate a wider pool of people differently, that has federal officials on edge. One senior health official said there was discussion in the Trump administration about the piecemeal vaccination distribution approach causing problems during the rollout. Those concerns were largely shot down, the official said, adding that states were rushed to submit their vaccination distribution reports and “barely had time to speak to the federal government about those plans before the vaccine shipped.”“We knew this was coming,” the official said. “To some extent there was always going to be problems with a distribution campaign of this size and complexity. Things are bound to improve. But I’m not sure things had to get this bad.”White House officials say they plan to hold a virtual meeting with the nation’s governors Tuesday to discuss vaccine distribution. But the federal government has no plans to increase vaccine supply at this time, officials said.Over the next several weeks the Biden team plans to work closely with states to assess how many doses are already distributed that need to be accounted for, how many appointments have already been booked for first- and second-dose shots, and how many vaccine doses have been requested by states that have yet to be allocated. “Right now there’s no holistic way of accounting for all that,” one Biden official said.Another official said there are discussions underway about the possibility of changing the way local health departments report their vaccination numbers to the federal government as a way to improve the administration’s understanding of the distribution effort.In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has established a new interagency vaccination task force in the agency’s National Response Coordination Center and is set to deploy staff to support dozens of vaccination sites across the country to help with distribution, according to a spokesperson for the agency.In the meantime, Biden will tap the Defense Production Act to compel manufacturers to produce more personal protective equipment and to continue to scale testing across the country. Officials say Biden will also use the act and to develop more raw materials and syringes needed to increase vaccine production. Biden signed an executive order last week that allows federal agencies to “to fill those shortfalls as soon as practicable by acquiring additional stockpiles, improving distribution systems, building market capacity, or expanding the industrial base.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

{'_id': '47ae421857a1c9b22dadeee6af2dcfac', 'title': 'Time for Americans to Take Back Power from Teachers’ Unions', 'description': 'Tuesday was supposed to be a big day for a lot of kids in Oakland — they were supposed to be going back to school. Some of them were to be going to school for the first time. Unfortunately, it’s not going to happen. A deal between the school district and the teachers’ union had provided for reopening all of Oakland’s elementary schools, but, in spite of the deal, more than half of teachers are declining to return to the classroom, and so most of Oakland’s schools will not reopen as scheduled. Out of 50 pre-K and elementary schools covered by the agreement, only 21 — fewer than half — will reopen. A substantial number of teachers — almost a fifth — have indicated that they do not intend to return to school as required in mid April. While acknowledging the damage this is doing to children — isolation, depression, and other mental-health issues — Oakland School Board Director Shanthi Gonzales pleaded powerlessness, telling the San Francisco Chronicle, “I wish more teachers were volunteering.” That is what you get when the school district works for the teachers and not the other way around: schools in which the interests of children and their families take a distant second place to the desires of the public-sector unions that dominate Democratic politics around the country and run the show practically unopposed in California. This isn’t bare-knuckle labor politics — it’s political child abuse. The Centers for Disease Control has said that schools can be safely reopened while maintaining social distancing of as little as three feet. And, as we all know, the pronouncements of the CDC are the gold standard for our progressive friends — right up until they run into the demands of an important Democratic constituency, at which point, they become trash. American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten says she’s “not convinced” by the CDC’s advice. Weingarten, a lawyer by education and a union goon by profession, is, to say the least, not very well prepared to critically review the CDC’s public-health findings. We have been through a great deal in the past year, with the schools and other institutions taking extraordinary measures that were generally, even when we disagreed, understandable. But 100 million Americans have now received at least one dose of one of the COVID-19 vaccines, and the research overwhelmingly finds that elementary-school education is a relatively low-risk proposition — and that every additional unnecessary delay in the return of ordinary education does real and lasting damage to children, especially to those whose families do not have the resources to adequately pick up the slack. A great many people have worked throughout this terrible episode, many at some considerable personal risk, and not only doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers but also grocery clerks, warehouse workers, and taxi drivers. They have kept the country running while unionized teachers in Oakland and elsewhere have turned up their noses at the children they are supposed to be serving and looked instead to their own two-point agenda: (1) not going to work; (2) getting paid. Randi Weingarten exercises more real practical political power than any senator or cabinet secretary, and her power is exercised exclusively in the interest of public-sector workers and the Democratic Party, which they effectively control. Perhaps it is time for Americans to take back some of that power.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'baa0b3bd82165f82f59d6cfa456a3396', 'title': '‘Not All Pastors Do That’: How Rev. Raphael Warnock’s Used His Pulpit to Fight AIDS', 'description': "“We don’t like to talk about these things in church,” the Rev. Raphael Warnock cautioned the congregation at Atlanta’s storied Ebenezer Baptist Church in March 2010, but “I’m very convinced that if Martin Luther King, Jr. were alive today, he would be focused on the issue of HIV/AIDS.”He then stepped back from the pulpit, sat down at a nearby table, and in front of the church’s 1,700 congregants, swabbed his gums to take a rapid OraQuick HIV test.As Warnock campaigns in a historic U.S. Senate runoff amid the dark winter of the coronavirus pandemic, he has made addressing the virus—and its disproportionate effect on Georgia’s Black communities—a centerpiece of his run. But the 43-year-old Democrat has dedicated much of his life as a pastor and social justice activist to combatting another epidemic that has uniquely harmed Black Americans: HIV/AIDS.“Not all pastors do that,” said James Curran, a professor of epidemiology and an HIV/AIDS expert at Emory University in Atlanta. “Early on, it was a very controversial topic in churches—that’s true in Black churches, white churches, evangelical churches, Catholic churches.”Many churches didn’t want to touch the topic, Curran told The Daily Beast—or if they did, “they wanted to accept the sinner but not forgive the sin.”As the respected pastor of one of the nation’s most revered Black churches—whose pulpit King preached from—Warnock has been in a unique position to fight what he frequently calls “the unholy trinity” of silence, shame, and stigma surrounding the virus. And he has taken on that project in a city where HIV/AIDS infection remains dangerously higher than elsewhere in the U.S.Warnock’s campaign did not make him available to The Daily Beast for an interview in time for this article’s publication. But half a dozen HIV/AIDS experts and advocates in Georgia said that the reverend-turned-candidate has indeed walked the walk on preventing the disease, from dramatic gestures aimed squarely at stigma, to behind the scenes work on the finer points of policy—work that informs Warnock’s thinking on broader health inequities and the COVID-19 pandemic unfolding now.In many respects, there are clear connections between HIV/AIDS and COVID-19. Like HIV, it has devastated Black communities in the state Warnock hopes to represent in the Senate—Black Georgians accounted for 80 percent of hospitalizations due to the virus when it first hit in March, researchers from Atlanta’s Morehouse College later found.“We see in COVID the same sort of health inequities that we have seen for decades with HIV,” said Melanie Thompson, an Atlanta doctor who has worked on AIDS advocacy, research, and public policy for several decades. “If anything, COVID has magnified the existing disparities.”But the pandemic has also cut across communities of every demographic in rural Georgia, where eight hospitals have been closed down due to lack of funding over the past 10 years, something Warnock has emphasized on the campaign trail.“The virus has devastated the Black community in ways that are disproportionate,” Warnock told The American Prospect last month. “But as I move across disaffected, rural communities across Georgia, white sisters and brothers are suffering and wondering why the conversation in Washington is so disconnected from their actual lives.”Kelly Loeffler to Face Off Against Raphael Warnock for Georgia’s Senate SeatWarnock may soon get a chance to be one of 100 U.S. senators shaping policy on the COVID pandemic. But when it comes to the epidemic he’s already spent much of his life working on, few people in Georgia have had the unique kind of impact Warnock has, say those familiar with his work.“My argument is that the symbolic precedes the structural,” said Charles Stephens, an HIV/AIDS activist in Atlanta and the founder of the Counter Narrative Project, an advocacy group for Black gay men. “I wouldn’t be quick to dismiss the value of symbolism… because of the number of people he can reach, because of what he represents.”“That being said, that shouldn’t be the endpoint,” Stephens told The Daily Beast. “My hope for Rev. Warnock is that… he continues to use his platform to not only bring attention to HIV, and to inspire people to respond, but also to connect to HIV/AIDS as a racial justice issue, to look at institutional failures.”Activists say that if Warnock is elected come Jan. 5, it may be the first time ever that a freshman senator arrives in Washington already steeped in the work of HIV/AIDS advocacy. And there are signs that Warnock, if elected, would make combating HIV/AIDS a key part of his portfolio as a lawmaker: his Senate campaign website, for instance, devotes a page to LGBTQ issues and touches on funding for PrEP, an HIV prevention drug.Local HIV/AIDS advocates, like Jeff Graham, can’t remember the last time, if ever, that a U.S. Senate candidate in Georgia devoted prominent space on their platform to this issue in such a way. Graham, the director of the LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Georgia, said he’d bring a unique perspective to the issue on Capitol Hill.“Frankly, even though there’s been support from U.S. senators of both parties in the past, we haven't had that sort of strong personal connection and experience of what day to day life is for people with AIDS,” he said.That connection began in Baltimore, two decades ago, when Warnock took the first head pastor job of his career, at Douglas Memorial Community Church. In the early 2000s, HIV/AIDS cases were on the rise, rising past the 10,000 mark in the city. Of all cases, nearly 90 percent were among Black men and women.“Everything I do is theologically and biblically informed,” Warnock told the Baltimore Sun in 2001, weeks before he took the reins of one of the city’s largest and most influential churches. Quoting the Old Testament prophet Hosea—”My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”—Warnock warned that willful ignorance about HIV was hollowing out the communities that he was seeking to serve.“That is literally the case with regard to HIV/AIDS,” Warnock said at the time. “People do not know what they need to know about the virus itself, and they do not know their HIV status. If the clergy went to get tested en masse, we could create a climate where you remove the stigma.”Warnock’s passion for fighting the epidemic followed him to Atlanta, which has become a national hotspot for new infections, particularly among Black communities. Georgia ranks among the top five states for new HIV infections nationwide—it had the highest rate per capita of any state in 2018—and AIDS is the leading cause of death for Black men between the ages of 35 and 44 in the state. In 2018, Atlanta’s case rate reached such heights that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta, likened the city’s rate of infection to those in sub-Saharan Africa.Graham said that he served with Warnock on an HIV/AIDS advisory board in Atlanta, shortly after the young preacher first arrived there from Baltimore in 2005, at a time when focus centered on getting federal and state dollars toward prevention measures.In sermons, public remarks and newspaper editorials, Warnock has frequently invoked the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to push for greater national focus on the epidemic—particularly in light of the fact that, as he noted during a special interest session on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 2008, “as the epidemic has swung to people of color, the money has not followed.”“One can almost hear Dr. King’s voice thundering from the crypt,” Warnock wrote in a 2003 opinion piece in the Baltimore Sun in the leadup to the Iraq War. “‘A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.’”Following in King’s example, Warnock would later take his work on combating the epidemic to those in power. In 2014, he was arrested outside the state capitol while protesting Republicans’ refusal to expand Medicaid. Three years later, he was again arrested in Washington, D.C. during a protest in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building against President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts.The budget would have slashed funding for PEPFAR—the federal program aimed at combating HIV/AIDS in the world's poorest countries—by 17 percent, and totally eliminated federal funding for AIDS education and training centers.> Atlanta @RaphaelWarnock arrested w/other ministers at U.S. Captiol while demanding fair healthcare blackclergyvoices BlackClergyUprising pic.twitter.com/ke8SC6DMjU> > — TenishaTaylorMade (@TeeTaylorMade) July 18, 2017After his arrest, he told reporters that “the national budget is not just a fiscal document, but a moral document,” and that in light of those who would suffer from the cuts to social and health services, “my getting arrested is a small price to pay.”Allies of Warnock’s also say that his focus on HIV/AIDS is inextricably linked with the issue he’s putting at the forefront of his campaign, health care. Nan Orrock, a Democratic state senator who is a friend and neighbor of Warnock’s, talked about his involvement in the years-long push to expand Medicaid in Georgia, something that he has pledged to do on the federal level if elected.A string of GOP governors in Georgia have successfully blocked the option to expand Medicaid, which would be backed by federal dollars under the Affordable Care Act, while deep-red states like Idaho and Nebraska have chosen to do so.Advocates view that as a serious obstacle to HIV/AIDS treatment in Georgia. Expanding Medicaid, said Orrock, would be “critically important in the battle to protect people from HIV infection, and to provide life-saving health services when you’re battling HIV.” Warnock’s commitment on the issue—evinced by his arrests, said Orrock—“speaks for itself.”But Warnock has also sought to work within government to address the HIV/AIDS crisis within Black communities, putting his considerable influence behind the National Black Clergy for the Elimination of AIDS Act, landmark legislation that would create targeted grants for faith-based organizations to provide HIV testing, prevention services, and community outreach.If elected, HIV/AIDS advocates hope that Warnock would become one of the Senate’s most forceful advocates for increasing funding for the disease’s prevention and treatment—particularly for the Ryan White program, a federal initiative that provides treatment for roughly half a million people with HIV, usually from the neediest populations. The program has in recent years been funded at somewhat stagnant levels, experts say, though those in Georgia note that the previous occupant of the seat Warnock is running for, former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), was considered a reliable ally in increasing funding.In response to an inquiry from The Daily Beast, Warnock’s campaign said that working to lower the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment and prescriptions will be among his priorities in expanding health care access more generally.If he defeats Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) in the runoff, Warnock will be thrust into office as Congress and President-elect Joe Biden, in all likelihood, strive to put together a sweeping COVID-19 relief package after months of fruitless negotiations and gridlock.Observers can’t help but note how Warnock’s work on HIV/AIDS positions him as an uncommon voice on COVID-19. While the coronavirus carries with it hardly any of the social stigma of HIV, there remains distrust within the broader public, and within the Black community in particular, about treatment measures, such as a forthcoming vaccine. A Gallup poll released on Oct. 17 found that six in ten Americans would agree to take an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine. But less than half of nonwhite Americans said they would agree.The legacy of the Tuskegee experiment, in which U.S. government public health officials studied Black men with syphilis while denying them treatment in the mid-20th century, is alive and well, said Thompson, and several Atlanta public health experts concurred that the lingering deficit of trust is very real.“I think building back that trust is not a matter of words and platitudes, it’s a matter of action,” said Thompson. “Warnock is the kind of guy who will walk the walk, put actions there that will help to rebuild trust.”Harry Heiman, a doctor and professor of public health at Georgia State University in Atlanta, agreed, saying, “if there aren't targeted strategies specific to those communities being disproportionately impacted, we’re going to fail, in the same way we're trying to overcome historical failures in HIV/AIDS.”Asked if Warnock might reprise his famous HIV test from the pulpit by taking a COVID test in front of congregants, or constituents if elected, his campaign said he will take a COVID-19 vaccine when available and recommended by medical professionals, and “in following science and trusted scientists, he will encourage others to do the same.”Still, many experts couldn’t help but imagine the visual of Warnock reprising the display that turned his HIV advocacy into headlines, and spoke to his skill as a communicator. “Think about the politics of a Senator Warnock getting a COVID vaccination on television,” said Heiman. “He understands, literally, the power of the pulpit.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Photograph: Eric Gay/AP The White House has defended Joe Biden’s criticism of the Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi, after the president called their decisions to end mask mandates “Neanderthal thinking”. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, emphasized that the president was comparing the governors’ actions to “the behavior of a Neanderthal, just to be very clear, the behavior”. She also said Biden’s comments were “a reflection of his frustration” about Americans not following public health guidance to limit their risk of contracting coronavirus. “I don’t think his view on mask wearing is a secret,” Psaki said at the Thursday White House briefing. “And I’m certain when he speaks with them next, he will convey that directly.” The US president had said on Wednesday that the country was on the “cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease” with the distribution of vaccines and added: “The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime, everything’s fine.” The Texas governor Greg Abbott hit back at Biden on Wednesday, telling CNBC that the comment was “not the type of word that a president should be using”. Abbott, who has often been criticized for his anti-immigrant rhetoric, then accused the president of “releasing illegal immigrants into our communities who had Covid,” calling it a “Neanderthal-type approach to dealing with the Covid situation”. Addressing Abbott’s comments on Thursday, Psaki said: “We’re about facts around here. That is not factual.” She added that it was also the responsibility of state and local governments to test-and-trace. Abbott appeared to be referencing recent reporting from Telemundo, which found that some migrants released by border patrol in Brownsville, Texas, subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. Since the city started testing in January, 108 migrants had tested positive, roughly 6% of all those who took a test, the report said. Abbott’s move to reopen Texas and drop its mask mandate goes against advice from top US health officials, who have repeatedly urged states not to completely lift Covid-19 restrictions as they warned of a potential fourth surge in coronavirus cases fueled by new variants. “We’ve been very clear that now is not the time to release all restrictions. The next month or two is really pivotal,” said Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on Wednesday. The president on Tuesday announced that the US expects to have enough coronavirus vaccines for all adults by the end of May, two months earlier than anticipated, as his administration announced that the drugmaker Merck would help produce rival Johnson & Johnson’s shot that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last weekend for emergency use. But officials in many states have been easing restrictions, some far more than others. Abbott moved to lift his state’s mask-wearing mandate and a host of other limitations, while Mississippi also rescinded its mask mandate beginning on Wednesday. Michigan’s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer eased capacity limits on restaurants and public and residential gatherings. New York announced that arts and entertainment could resume indoors, at 33% capacity, in April. In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker said residents should continue to wear masks in public, but it was time for more limits on businesses to be eased. Texas will be the most populous US state that does not require residents to wear face coverings. The mayor of the state’s largest city, Houston, disagreed with the move. “It’s a step in the wrong direction, unless the governor is trying to deflect what happened a little more than two weeks ago with the winter storm,” Sylvester Turner said, adding: “I’m very disappointed … it makes no sense.”', 'num_of_covid': 1}

These findings by South Korea\'s National Intelligence Service were disclosed to lawmakers during a National Assembly\'s intelligence committee hearing this week, with lawmaker Ha Tae-keung telling reporters, "The cyberattacks included an attempt to steal COVID-19 vaccine and treatment technology, to which Pfizer was subject," The Washington Post reports. It reportedly wasn\'t clear whether the attempt was successful. This comes after Microsoft revealed in November that North Korean and Russian hackers had targeted "seven prominent companies directly involved in researching vaccines and treatments for COVID-19," including pharmaceutical companies. The "majority of these attacks were blocked," Microsoft said. Pfizer and BioNTech developed one of the COVID-19 vaccines that was approved last year for emergency use in the United States. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has claimed the country hasn\'t had cases of COVID-19, though CBS News writes that "outside experts doubt those assertions," and the Post notes that North Korea is still reportedly set to receive almost two million AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine doses.

But we have to look to get back to normal."iProov\'s Bud points out that vaccine certificates are being rolled out in some countries, and in the United States, private-sector health passes have been used to admit people to sports events.It\'s the developers\' job to work out the technicalities, he says. Conversations about the political and social issues can\'t wait."This is going to happen and the question is, how should it be regulated?

Biden has set a goal to vaccinate 100 million Americans during his first 100 days in office. During the press conference, Biden called the Trump administration’s distribution of coronavirus vaccines a “dismal failure so far,” warning that “things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.” However, the seven-day rolling average for coronavirus vaccine doses administered to Americans currently sits at 912,000, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. (On Wednesday alone, 1.6 million doses were administered.) This indicates that the Biden administration is not far from its goal of vaccinating one million Americans per day. On Thursday, Associated Press reporter Zeke Miller asked Biden if the vaccination goal was “high enough,” since “that’s basically where the U.S. is right now.” “When I announced it you all said it wasn’t possible. Come on, give me a break, man,” Biden responded. “It’s a good start, a hundred million.” Internal projections from the Trump administration showed that the U.S. could administer at least 170 million doses by the end of April, two Trump administration officials told Bloomberg. During the press conference, Biden also announced that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to “accelerate the making of everything that’s needed to protect, test, and vaccinate and the care of our people.” Biden warned that the death toll from coronavirus infections would hit 500,000 in February.

Each of them demonstrated symptoms of anaphylactoid reaction, leading U.K. authorities to advise anyone with that condition to not take the vaccine. Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued its own warning. Read on to hear it, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus.\xa0Use Caution if You "Have Experienced Severe Allergic Reactions"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s leading infectious disease expert, was asked if he agrees with the U.K. directive. "I do. I do," he said. "We are very carefully monitoring these things. And when we see something like an allergic reaction, you modify the recommendation and you say that someone who has a history of a severe allergic reaction, that those individuals don\'t get vaccinated now with this product, or if they do get vaccinated, they do it in a location that has the capability of responding to an allergic reaction." Officially, the FDA says "you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if you:\xa0had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine\xa0had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine."The CDC weighed on December 19th, with the following posting:"CDC has learned of reports that some people have experienced severe allergic reactions—also known as anaphylaxis—after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. As an example, an allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen© or if they must go to the hospital.If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911."What the CDC RecommendsThe CDC goes on: "If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, CDC recommends that you should not get that specific vaccine. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injectable therapies, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. Your doctor will help you decide if it is safe for you to get vaccinated.RELATED: 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say DoctorsCDC recommends that people with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injectable medications—such as allergies to food, pet, venom, environmental, or latex—may still get vaccinated. People with a history of allergies to oral medications or a family history of severe allergic reactions, or who might have an milder allergy to vaccines (no anaphylaxis)—may also still get vaccinated.If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist in allergies and immunology to provide more care or advice."Safeguards Are in PlaceSays the CDC: "CDC has provided recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination providers about how to prepare for the possibility of a severe allergic reaction:All people who get a COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored on-site. People with a history of severe allergic reactions should be monitored for 30 minutes after getting the vaccine. All other people should be monitored for 15 minutes after getting the vaccine.Vaccination providers should have appropriate medications and equipment—such as epinephrine, antihistamines, stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and timing devices to check your pulse—at all COVID-19 vaccination sites.If you experience a severe allergic reaction after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, vaccination providers should provide rapid care and call for emergency medical services. You should continue to be monitored in a medical facility for at least several hours.Learn more about what to expect after getting vaccinated for COVID-19, including normal side effects and tips to reduce pain or discomfort."How to Survive the PandemicAs for yourself, the vaccine is not yet available to those who aren\'t the highest priority, so follow Dr. Fauci\'s fundamentals and help end this surge—wear a face mask, social distance, avoid large crowds, don\'t go indoors with people you\'re not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene and to protect your life and the lives of others, don\'t visit any of these 35 Places You\'re Most Likely to Catch COVID.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

But as Thanksgiving approaches, I find myself longing for the type of freedom I am seeing in China. People in China are able to move around freely right now. Many Americans may believe that the Chinese are able to enjoy this freedom because of China’s authoritarian regime. As a scholar of public health in China, I think the answers go beyond that.My research suggests that the control of the virus in China is not the result of authoritarian policy, but of a national prioritization of health. China learned a tough lesson with SARS, the first coronavirus pandemic of the 21st century.  How China flattened its curveBarely less than a year ago, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, with 80,000 cases identified within three months, killing 3,000 people. In late January 2020, the Chinese government decided to lock down this city of 11 million people. All transportation to and from the city was stopped. Officials further locked down several other cities in Hubei Province, eventually quarantining over 50 million people.By the beginning of April, the Chinese government limited the spread of the virus to the point where they felt comfortable opening up Wuhan once again. Seven months later, China has confirmed 9,100 additional cases and recorded 1,407 more deaths due to the coronavirus. People in China travel, eat in restaurants and go into theaters, and kids go to school without much concern for their health. Juxtapose that to what we are experiencing in the U.S. To date, we have confirmed over 11 million cases, with the last 1 million recorded in just the last one week alone. In September and October, friends from China sent me pictures of food from all over the country as they traveled around to visit friends and family for the mid-autumn festival and then the seven-day National Day vacation week. I envied them then and envy them even more now as Americans prepare and wonder how we will celebrate Thanksgiving this year.  What China learned from SARSWe Americans are told that the freedoms Chinese now enjoy come at the expense of being subject to a set of draconian public health policies that can be instituted only by an authoritarian government. But they also have the experience of living through a similar epidemic.SARS broke out in November of 2002 and ended in May of 2003, and China was anything but prepared for its emergence. It didn’t have the public health infrastructure in place to detect or control such a disease, and initially decided to prioritize politics and economy over health by covering up the epidemic. This didn’t work with such a virulent disease that started spreading around the world. After being forced to come to terms with SARS, China’s leaders eventually did enforce quarantine in Beijing and canceled the week-long May Day holiday of 2003. This helped to end the pandemic within a few short months, with minimal impact. SARS infected approximately 8,000 worldwide and killed about 800, 65% of which occurred in China and Hong Kong. The Chinese government learned from SARS the important role public health plays in protecting the nation. Following SARS, the government improved training of public health professionals and developed one of the most sophisticated disease surveillance systems in the world. While caught off guard for this next big coronavirus outbreak in December 2019, the country quickly mobilized its resources to bring the epidemic almost to a halt inside its borders within three months.  What can the US learn from China?Knowing that there were no safe or proven treatments or an effective vaccine, China relied on proven nonpharmaceutical interventions to conquer the epidemic. First and foremost was containing the virus through controlling the sources of infection and blocking transmission. This was accomplished through early detection (testing), isolation, treatment and tracing the close contacts of any infected individual. This strategy was aided by the three field hospitals (fancang) the government built to isolate patients with mild to moderate symptoms from their families. Strict quarantine measures were also central to preventing the spread of this epidemic, as it was with the SARS epidemic in 2003. This was paired with compulsory mask-wearing, promotion of personal hygiene (hand-washing, home disinfection, ventilation), self-monitoring of body temperature, universal compulsory stay-at-home orders for all residents, and universal symptom surveys conducted by community workers and volunteers.  What else could the US have done to be prepared?SARS exposed serious weaknesses in China’s public health system and prompted its government to reinvent its public health system. COVID-19 has exposed similar shortcomings in the U.S. public health system. To date, however, the current administration has taken the exact opposite approach, devastating our public health system. The Trump administration made major cuts to the budgets of the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last budget submitted by the Trump administration in February 2020, as the pandemic was beginning, called for an additional reduction of US$693 million to the CDC budget. This affected our ability to prepare for a pandemic outbreak. In the past, this preparation included international partnerships to help detect disease before it reached our shores. For example, the CDC built up partnerships with China following the SARS epidemic, to help contain the emergence of infectious disease coming from the region. At one point the CDC had 10 American experts working on the ground in China and 40 local Chinese staff, who mostly concentrated on infectious disease. Trump started slashing these positions shortly after taking office, and by the time COVID-19 broke out, those programs were whittled down to a skeleton staff of one or two. [Research into coronavirus and other news from science Subscribe to The Conversation’s new science newsletter.]The Declaration of Alma Ata guaranteed health for all, and not just health for people governed under a specific type of bureaucratic system. The U.S. has been, and can be, just as dedicated to protecting the health of its people as China under its authoritarian government. We demonstrated this during the Ebola epidemic, with the launch of a whole government effort coordinated by Ron Klain, who has been appointed White House chief of staff under President-elect Biden.This effort, which included a coordinated response with both African nations and China, improved preparedness within the U.S. and ultimately helped to save hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. A reduction in funding for our public health infrastructure, under the Trump administration, was a divestment in the health of the American people and should not have happened. A new administration that places public health at the helm, once again, will I hope prove to us that health is not just something that can be protected under an authoritarian government, but is in fact a right for all.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

It’s not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a live television address on Friday morning, adding that drug companies from his long-time adversaries send vaccines to other countries to “see if they work or not”. “If their Pfizer manufacturer can produce a vaccine, then why do they want to give it to us?” he said. “They should use it themselves so they don’t experience so many fatalities. Same with the UK”. Iran is struggling to contain its Covid-19 outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1.3 million people and killed nearly 56,000. The supreme leader also said he also had doubts over the French due to a 1990s blood scandal in which France delivered blood supplies to several countries, including Iran, that were later found to be infected with HIV. Friday’s ban caused the cancellation of an existing deal to import 150,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which had been secured with the help of a group of US philanthropists. Iranian officials have repeatedly said that US sanctions on the country undermine any efforts to purchase foreign-made vaccines and launch mass vaccination campaigns. Iran has several other vaccine candidates, Khomeini said, though none are expected to clear animal trials before the end of February. The central bank governor said in December that Tehran was in talks with China to receive a million doses. Officials also reportedly held discussions with Russia about joint production of its Sputnik V jab. Both are allies of Iran. The government is also trying to secure 16.8 million doses of vaccines from Covax, a global vaccine effort operating under the World Health Organization, dedicated to assuring fair access for low- and middle-income countries. Despite the ban, Iran is still part of the Covax scheme, their spokesperson said. According to Gavi - a vaccine alliance that helped set up Covax - the only vaccine available to Iran through the scheme, now that they are boycotting the US and the UK, will be an AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India. Covax has a deal for 200 million doses to share through all participating countries across the globe.

Doug Burgum exhibited what may be the most unfortunate choice of words in the whole pandemic when he described the benefit of ending a successful mask measure to curb a disease.�A chance for us to take a breather,� he said at a press briefing.Guv Is More Obsessed With Filling COVID Victim�s Seat Than Stopping COVIDBefore Burgum reluctantly imposed a mask mandate back in November, North Dakota had had the highest per capita COVID-19 death rate in the world for six weeks. It had led the nation in per capita cases for two months.When he allowed the mandate and other basic restrictions to expire months later, his state had the third-lowest rate in America by both measures. Active cases fell 85 percent, from 10,173 to 1,513, after the mask rule went into effect. Deaths fell by 86 percent, from over 16 per day to fewer than three in January.Because the mandate had been so amazingly successful, Burgum reasoned that it was no longer needed. He decreed that as of Jan. 18, the state would revert to �personal responsibility,� the very same approach that had previously caused it to become a COVID capital of America and the world. He noted the continuing importance of wearing a mask, just as he often had prior to the mandate with little effect.�The science doesn't change when the mandate goes away,� he said, as if his words would make more of a difference than they had before.A number of local mandates remained in place, but some state legislators are pushing a measure to outlaw face-covering requirements anywhere in North Dakota.�We tried the masks, let�s ditch the masks,� Rep. Jeff Hoverson told reporters. �I�m not just condemning something; I�m promoting a build-up-immunity program. So rather than �Mask up, North Dakota,� it ought to be �Build up, North Dakota.��The only thing Hoverson�s measure would build up would be the state�s COVID-19 body count, which has reached 1,447.Deadly COVID Mutations Can�t Stop the Party in FloridaMeanwhile, the Republican-dominated Wisconsin Assembly voted on Thursday to repeal the mask mandate imposed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The GOP-dominated state Senate already voted last week 18-13 for a mandate repeal, and the Assembly had been about to follow suit last Thursday when somebody pointed out that the state would lose $50 million in relief money if it did not have an emergency order of some kind in place. The Senate sought to remedy that with some quick, mask-free legislation. On Thursday, the Assembly voted 52-42 to proceed with a repeal. Evers responded by instituting a new mandate later in the afternoon.�Wearing a mask is the most basic thing we can do to keep each other safe,� Evers said in a video that accompanied the renewed mandate. �If the Legislature keeps playing politics and we don�t keep wearing masks, we're going to see more preventable deaths, and it�s going to take even longer to get our state and our economy back on track.�Along with defying science, the Republican effort to repeal the mandate makes no immediate political sense. Polls show that more than 70 percent of people in Wisconsin support a mask mandate. The Republicans may be seeking to placate the more fervent anti-maskers�the basest of the base�but it also seems to be a continuation of a partisan struggle that began back when Evers was first elected and House Speaker Robin Vos sought to strip him of his powers. The Republicans may now be seeking to end the popular mask mandate simply because Evers imposed it.�A lot of pride, ego,� the top Assembly Democrat, Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, told The Daily Beast.Also a lot more death if the mandate is repealed. Hintz referred to a November CDC study in Kansas, where some counties opted out of a state mask mandate. Counties that rejected the mandate saw a 100 percent rise in COVID-19 cases. Counties that observed a mandate saw a 6 percent decrease despite a statewide surge.Yet despite the proven success of mandates, two Kansas counties that had previously adhered to it decided to opt out at the end of December. A video of the Dec. 28 meeting of the Brown County Board of Commissioners shows that the CEO of Hiawatha Community Hospital, John Broberg, testified in favor of a mask requirement.�This is so basic,� he said. �If we don�t act, we�re going to see these rates climb.�He added, �My 4-year-old and my 7-year-old wear it religiously. It�s that perspective, �We�re doing this for us.��The board proceeded to prove it had less sense than his kids, voting 3-0 to repeal the mandate.�Today,� one of the commissioners said to make clear it took immediate effect, as if it were an urgent action that could save lives rather than put them at risk.Jackson County followed on Dec. 29, repealing the mandate with a 2-1 vote. The virus thereby gained another locale where it will spread with greater ease. It will therefore have more opportunity to mutate. And a single mutation could make the virus more contagious and maybe more lethal and perhaps better able to defeat the vaccines. The absence of a mask can thereby endanger not just a county or a state, but the whole nation along with people everywhere.�Now is not the time to let our guard down,� Dr. Anthony Fauci said at a White House briefing on Wednesday.The CDC will likely soon determine that the data supports double masking with variants spreading across the nation. Now what to do about the triple insanity of those who do not want to mandate any mask at all, even as the death toll hit 450,000 this week?They endanger not just their own county or state but all of us everywhere.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

{'_id': '9086bd6fc531d6f2ec8f99e0454c31cc', 'title': 'Dr. Fauci Says COVID Vaccine Could Come Earlier Than Thought', 'description': 'A COVID-19 vaccine could be available earlier than expected if ongoing clinical trials produce overwhelmingly positive results, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\'s top infectious disease official, in an interview Tuesday with KHN. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don\'t miss these Sure Signs You\'ve Already Had Coronavirus. Fauci Says If the Vaccine is "Safe and Effective," Trials Could StopAlthough two ongoing clinical trials of 30,000 volunteers are expected to conclude by the end of the year, Fauci said an independent board has the authority to end the trials weeks early if interim results are overwhelmingly positive or negative.The Data and Safety Monitoring Board could say, "\'The data is so good right now that you can say it\'s safe and effective,\'" Fauci said. In that case, researchers would have "a moral obligation" to end the trial early and make the active vaccine available to everyone in the study, including those who had been given placebos — and accelerate the process to give the vaccine to millions.Fauci\'s comments come at a time of growing concern about whether political pressure from the Trump administration could influence federal regulators and scientists overseeing the nation\'s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, and erode shaky public confidence in vaccines. Prominent vaccine experts have said they fear Trump is pushing for an early vaccine approval to help win reelection.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he trusts the independent members of the DSMB — who are not government employees — to hold vaccines to high standards without being politically influenced. Members of the board are typically experts in vaccine science and biostatistics who teach at major medical schools."If you are making a decision about the vaccine, you\'d better be sure you have very good evidence that it is both safe and effective," Fauci said. "I\'m not concerned about political pressure."RELATED: COVID Mistakes You Should Never Make The Testing Process is RigorousThe safety board periodically looks at data from a clinical trial to determine if it\'s ethical to continue enrolling volunteers, who are randomly assigned to receive either an experimental vaccine or a placebo shot. Neither the volunteers nor the health workers who vaccinate them know which shot they\'re receiving.Manufacturers are now testing three COVID vaccines in large-scale U.S. trials. The first two studies — one led by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health and the other led by Pfizer and BioNTech — began in late July. Each study was designed to enroll 30,000 participants. Company officials have said both trials have enrolled about half that total. AstraZeneca, which has been running large-scale clinical trials in Great Britain, Brazil and South Africa, launched another large-scale vaccine study this week in the U.S., involving 30,000 volunteers. Additional vaccine trials are expected to begin this month.In trials of this size, researchers will know if a vaccine is effective after as few as 150 to 175 infections, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a call with reporters Friday."It may be surprising, but the number of events that need to occur is relatively small," Redfield said.Right now, only the safety board has access to the trial data, said Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. As for when trial results will be available, "we cannot determine if it will be the middle of October or December."Safety boards set "stopping rules" at the beginning of a study, making their criteria for ending a trial very clear, said Dr. Eric Topol, executive vice president for research at Scripps Research in San Diego and an expert on the use of data in medical research.Although the safety board can recommend stopping a trial, the ultimate decision to halt a study is made by the scientists running the trial, Topol said.A vaccine manufacturer could then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization, which can be granted quickly, or continue through the regular drug approval process, which requires more time and evidence.Safety monitors also can stop a trial because of safety concerns, "if it looks like it\'s actually harming people in the vaccine arm, due to a lot of adverse events," Fauci said.Fauci said people can trust the process, because all the data that outside monitors used to make their decisions would be made public."All of that has to be transparent," Fauci said. "The only time you get concerned is if there is any pressure to terminate the trial before you have enough data on safety and efficacy."RELATED: I\'m a Doctor and Here\'s When You Can Safely Keep Your Mask Off Political Controversy Surrounds VaccinesTopol and other scientists have sharply criticized the FDA in recent weeks, accusing Commissioner Stephen Hahn of bowing to political pressure from the Trump administration, which has pushed the agency to approve COVID treatments faster.Stopping trials early poses a number of risks, such as making a vaccine look more effective than it really is, Topol said."If you stop something early, you can get an exaggerated benefit that isn\'t real," because less positive evidence only emerges later, Topol said.Stopping the studies early also could prevent researchers from recruiting more minority volunteers. So far, only about 1 in 5 trial participants are Black or Hispanic. Given that Blacks and Hispanics have been hit harder than other groups by the pandemic, Topol said, it\'s important that they make up a larger part of vaccine trials.Ending vaccine trials early also carries safety risks, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine developer who serves on an NIH advisory panel on COVID vaccines and treatments.A smaller, shorter trial could fail to detect important vaccine side effects, which could become apparent only after millions of people have been immunized, said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia.Researchers will continue to follow vaccinated volunteers for a full year to look for long-term side effects, Redfield said.And Fauci acknowledged that cutting a trial short could undermine public confidence in COVID vaccines. One American in three is unwilling to get a COVID vaccine, according to a recent Gallup Poll.

{'_id': '881a392441f2fcf6ec0c5d1f205a33a2', 'title': 'Mnuchin Would Not Have Made $700M Loan To YRC', 'description': 'In a largely uncontentious commission hearing Thursday over the national security loan program, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged the $700 million loan made to less-than-truckload carrier YRC Worldwide (NASDAQ: YRCW) was "risky" and one that he would have not made.Facing questions from the oversight commission tasked with monitoring the distribution of federal loans established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Mnuchin said he was encouraged by members of Congress to take losses on the loans as the program\'s intent was to address an immediate liquidity crisis. He said some of the lending programs afforded under the act were done with the analysis that they would lose money.Referring to his former banking and lending days, Mnuchin said, "If my bank had been underwriting this loan, we would have not made this loan."National security designation The point of the hearing was to examine loans to "businesses critical to maintaining national security," a subtitle in the legislation that allotted $17 billion in federal money for companies fitting the designation. Mnuchin said he collaborated with the Department of Defense to establish the criteria for such companies, but it was ultimately former Defense Secretary Mark Esper who recommended and certified YRC met the standard.In prior oversight reports, the commission has called into question YRC\'s designation as such a company. YRC provides 68% of the Defense Department\'s LTL services hauling food, electronics and other supplies domestically for the military, a task commission members have suggested could be done by other carriers.Mnuchin referred the commission to the Defense Department for further clarity on the designation as it made the decision.The Defense Department was also invited to testify at the hearing, but stated it was unable to attend. The commission plans to hold a separate hearing for the Defense Department at a future date, but noted that the department is "currently resisting making public" a transcript from the upcoming hearing.Concerns with underwriting guidelines for YRC loanSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., questioned some of the underwriting standards, noting five of the companies receiving loans lost money in the year prior to the decision, two were startups and some received more in loans than they made in revenue.Mnuchin said that the underwriting criteria established by Treasury was sufficient, noting that of the 74 applicants under the subtitle, only 11 were approved. He said Treasury had a hard time distinguishing between COVID-related impairments to a business\' 2020 expectations versus something that could be more structural in nature.On YRC, Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., questioned the collateral on the loan and whether it protected taxpayers. He said the company was allowed to borrow on its accounts receivable and the valuation of its real estate at 100 cents on a dollar. He also wondered if the value of the YRC fleet was reasonable given its age. Hill pegged total collateral pledged on the loan at roughly $1.1 billion, not the $1.6 billion that Treasury previously claimed.Hill continued questioning the rationale of making such a large loan to a company "rated speculatively" for the past 20 years and one that has been "hanging on by a thread since the global financial crisis.""The only way YRC has survived for the last 10 years is through bailouts by the government and the private equity industry," Hill continued. He contended YRC is "staying afloat by providing the cheapest pricing," stating that investment research shows the company charges about 18 cents per pound versus the average of its competitors, which is in the mid-20 cent range.Mnuchin said that the loan was undertaken with the added risk in mind and believes the collateral provided was adequate, pointing to the 30% equity position Treasury received from YRC as part of the loan agreement. That stock is now worth $100 million as the company\'s shares have tripled since the loan announcement.\xa0Mnuchin acknowledged the rebound in the economy and at YRC has been "fortunate."YRC\'s ties to the White HouseBharat Ramamurti, an attorney tasked with serving on the commission, asked Mnuchin if he had been contacted by President Trump\'s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, regarding the YRC loan. He asserted Kushner has "close ties" to Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO), which provided YRC with a $600 million term loan in September.Mnuchin said no one from Kushner\'s staff had reached out to him. Mnuchin acknowledged the loan was risky but that it was not a bailout of private equity. He said Treasury was tasked with moving very fast in uncertain and tough times and that many lawmakers spoke up on YRC\'s behalf, noting a loan to the company would save many union jobs.Ramamurti asked Mnuchin if anyone from the White House had contacted him regarding the loan. Mnuchin said he would turn over any correspondence with the White House to the commission.YRC CEO Darren Hawkins was named to the president\'s Great American Economic Revival task force in April and former YRC Chairman and CEO Bill Zollars was appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to the U.S. Postal Service board of governors in June.Hindsight on the loan program and next stepsAsked what he would have done differently, Mnuchin said, "I would use the same criteria" all over again. He said he could have made up to $5 trillion in loans in total, but believes Treasury\'s underwriting decisions were prudent and saved many jobs. He acknowledged many complaints around the handling of the distribution, with some saying he took on too much risk for loss and others saying he didn\'t take on enough.Mnuchin said he would advise the next Treasury secretary to sell the YRC loan and liquidate the equity position. He sees a "significant profit" to taxpayers in doing so. He also said Treasury doesn\'t want to be in the long-term business of making these types of loans.Mnuchin advised the Pentagon to look at all its vendors and spread the risk over multiple vendors when possible.The office of the director of National Intelligence responded that it would not attend Thursday\'s hearing. However, it told the commission that it hasn\'t designated any company critical to national security and didn\'t give any input in the Defense Department\'s designations.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden.  * Hub Group\'s $95M acquisition is path to being a last-mile market leader  * Daseke turnaround nets ‘positive outlook\' from ratings agency  * Old Dominion sees tonnage accelerate from August inflectionSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * UPS Begins Nationwide Shipping Of Vaccine Kits  * Rehearsal Exposes Gaps In COVID Vaccine Delivery(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Photograph: Cheney Orr/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock A US government economic relief program provided loans to five prominent anti-vaccine organizations that have spread misinformation about Covid-19, the Washington Post reported. Five anti-vaccine groups received more than $850,000 from the paycheck protection program (PPP), according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a UK-based group which fights misinformation and hate speech online. Congress created PPP loans to help small businesses hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. But documents obtained via a lawsuit brought by multiple news organizations showed groups that have promoted anti-vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories online also received the funds. The groups are the National Vaccine Information Center, Mercola Com Health Resources, Informed Consent Action Network, Children’s Health Defense Co and the Tenpenny Integrative Medical Center. Two Covid-19 vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, have received emergency use authorization in the US. Trials for both involved tens of thousands of people and showed both had 95% efficacy. But misinformation and conspiracy theories abound. The World Health Organization partnered with Facebook last year to help counter misinformation, though conspiracy theories are still spreading on the site. Twitter and YouTube have also tightened policies on vaccine misinformation. The Children’s Health Defense Co was founded by Robert Kennedy Jr, the son of the former attorney general, senator and presidential hopeful Bobby Kennedy and nephew of President John F Kennedy. The group says it is not anti-vaccine but is committed to raising questions about safety. Still, it has shared conspiracy theories on social media and sued Facebook last year after the platform restricted its ability to advertise. “I’ve never heard anybody say that a loan is only available to people who don’t question the government,” Kennedy told the Post. PPP loans have been subject to significant criticism since they were introduced last spring. Few restrictions were set regarding who could receive a loan. Among the more controversial recipients were debt collectors, the Los Angeles Lakers NBA team (who ultimately returned the money) and more than 5,600 companies in the fossil fuel industry. Many of the small businesses the program was intended to help struggled to access it. Congress said PPP loans were meant to prioritize businesses in “underserved” markets, which includes low-income communities, rural areas and businesses owned by people of color, women and veterans. But according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis published last month, most went to businesses in communities that already had more access to resources.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed higher efficacy rates in trials that used two doses.

It is expected to get final approval for widespread use on Sunday - after the FDA authorized its emergency use - with shipments expected to begin Sunday or Monday. And while both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need to be shipped frozen, J&J’s can be shipped and stored at normal refrigerator temperatures. Daily infections have declined since their January peak, and some states have begun to loosen restrictions on public gatherings. However, Fauci on CBS’s “Face the Nation” warned that caseloads could rise again if officials move too quickly. FAUCI: “Right now, as we’re going down and plateauing, is not the time to declare victory, cause we’re not victorious yet – particularly with the variants that are circulating in various parts of the country.” Fauci said he expected 20 million doses of J&J\'s vaccine to be available by the end of March.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': 'd2adc7efcf65df8b588400c77d796031', 'title': 'Could a Blood Test Show if a COVID-19 Vaccine Works?', 'description': 'A new study in monkeys suggests that a blood test could predict the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine -- and perhaps speed up the clinical trials needed to get a working vaccine to billions of people around the world.The study, published Friday in Nature, reveals telltale blood markers that predict whether a monkey\'s immune system is prepared to wipe out incoming coronaviruses.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe finding raises hope that researchers will be able to look for the same markers in people who get vaccines in clinical trials. If the markers are strong enough, they could reveal if the vaccines protect against COVID-19. And researchers would no longer have to wait for some trial volunteers to get the disease, as they do now."It will pave the way for a much more rapid advancement of the COVID vaccine field," said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and one of the researchers behind the new study.Last month brought the stunning news that clinical trials of two new coronavirus vaccines, one from Moderna and the other from Pfizer and BioNTech, showed efficacy rates around 95%.The strength of these two vaccines is, paradoxically, bad news for the dozens of others in earlier stages of development. Many of them will most likely have to be compared against the robust front-runners rather than a placebo shot. Because that is a high statistical bar to clear, their trials will need a lot more volunteers, time and money."You\'d have to follow millions of people for a long time," said Dr. Nelson Michael, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, where a protein-based vaccine is being prepared for clinical trials in early 2021. "It\'s just fantasy."For some smaller companies, these comparison trials may be deal-breakers. "You\'re going to see a lot of dropout," said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic.That\'s a big problem, because Pfizer and Moderna won\'t have nearly enough doses to give to everyone in the United States, let alone the world. And the next wave of vaccines may turn out to be superior to the first in one way or the other. They could cost a lot less, for example. Some might come in just one dose instead of two and won\'t need a deep freeze. Some might offer protection that lasts a lot longer."We\'d rather not have to revaccinate the world every one or two years," Michael said.The new monkey study offers a ray of hope for these next-generation vaccines, suggesting that they could be tested not against older vaccines but using a measurement known as a "correlate of protection.""That\'s the holy grail of vaccine research," Michael said.Influenza vaccines are already tested this way. Every new flu season requires the design of a new flu shot, but researchers don\'t have to run clinical trials comparing it with old versions. Instead, they just check whether the new vaccine triggers a person\'s immune system to make enough of a certain kind of antibody against the flu. If it does, then researchers know the vaccine is adequately stimulating the immune system.If scientists could discover a correlate of protection against the coronavirus, they could follow the example of the flu. "That is an entirely plausible and feasible scenario," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration said that basing clinical trials on correlates of protection -- if they turn out to exist -- "possibly could be considered in the future."In their new study, Barouch and his colleagues found a correlate of protection in monkeys. They built the experiment on their previous research showing that once monkeys recover from COVID-19, they can resist a second infection. The scientists drew blood from these exposed animals and isolated an array of protective antibodies called IgG.The researchers set out to see if there was a level of IgG that reliably protected monkeys from COVID-19. If the IgG antibodies produced by vaccines were above that level, the vaccines could be judged effective.To find that line, the researchers gave monkeys varying doses of antibodies and then exposed them all to the coronavirus and watched how well they fought off the infection. In the monkeys with the weakest dose, the viruses multiplied much as they would in an ordinary animal.But the monkeys that got a medium dose produced far fewer viruses. Some of them were able to wipe out the viruses altogether. At the highest dose, the monkeys were completely protected.Until now, scientists relied on circumstantial evidence that suggested IgG antibodies were crucial to clearing coronavirus infections. The new study puts that idea to the test -- and determines the threshold of IgG antibodies required to ward off an infection."This is the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that we\'ve actually proven that antibodies protect," Barouch said. "Everything else has been a statistical association."The experiment revealed that a modest amount of IgG antibodies turned out to be enough. That could be heartening news for vaccine developers because even so-so vaccines may be able to cross the threshold.Researchers are now starting to review the results of vaccine clinical trials to see if a correlate of protection like the one identified by Barouch and his colleagues in monkeys exists in people. "The study bodes well for the upcoming immune correlates studies," said Holly Janes, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute in Seattle who was not involved in Barouch\'s study.Although it will take some time for those studies to produce solid results, Janes said preliminary hints made her optimistic."The emerging data do suggest that we could be gleefully surprised," she said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

{'_id': '7fc5a3dc5c54cfa75ae442e05506d58a', 'title': "'COVID, COVID, COVID': In Trump's Final Chapter, a Failure to Rise to the Moment", 'description': 'WASHINGTON -- It was a warm summer Wednesday, Election Day was looming and President Donald Trump was even angrier than usual at the relentless focus on the coronavirus pandemic."You\'re killing me! This whole thing is! We\'ve got all the damn cases," Trump yelled at Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, during a gathering of top aides in the Oval Office on Aug. 19. "I want to do what Mexico does. They don\'t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you\'re vomiting."Mexico\'s record in fighting the virus was hardly one for the United States to emulate. But the president had long seen testing not as a vital way to track and contain the pandemic but as a mechanism for making him look bad by driving up the number of known cases.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesAnd on that day he was especially furious after being informed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, that it would be days before the government could give emergency approval to the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment, something Trump was eager to promote as a personal victory going into the Republican National Convention the following week."They\'re Democrats! They\'re against me!" he said, convinced that the government\'s top doctors and scientists were conspiring to undermine him. "They want to wait!"Throughout late summer and fall, in the heat of a reelection campaign that he would go on to lose, and in the face of mounting evidence of a surge in infections and deaths far worse than in the spring, Trump\'s management of the crisis -- unsteady, unscientific and colored by politics all year -- was in effect reduced to a single question: What would it mean for him?The result, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former administration officials and others in contact with the White House, was a lose-lose situation. Trump not only ended up soundly defeated by Joe Biden, but missed his chance to show that he could rise to the moment in the final chapter of his presidency and meet the defining challenge of his tenure.Efforts by his aides to persuade him to promote mask wearing, among the simplest and most effective ways to curb the spread of the disease, were derailed by his conviction that his political base would rebel against anything that would smack of limiting their personal freedom. Even his own campaign\'s polling data to the contrary could not sway him.His explicit demand for a vaccine by Election Day -- a push that came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting with top health aides in late September -- became a misguided substitute for warning the nation that failure to adhere to social distancing and other mitigation efforts would contribute to a slow-rolling disaster this winter.His concern? That the man he called "Sleepy Joe" Biden, who was leading him in the polls, would get credit for a vaccine, not him.The government\'s public health experts were all but silenced by the arrival in August of Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the Stanford professor of neuroradiology recruited after appearances on Fox News.With Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House virus task force, losing influence and often on the road, Atlas became the sole doctor Trump listened to. His theories, some of which scientists viewed as bordering on the crackpot, were exactly what the president wanted to hear: The virus is overblown, the number of deaths are exaggerated, testing is overrated, lockdowns do more harm than good.As the gap between politics and science grew, the infighting that Trump had allowed to plague the administration\'s response from the beginning only intensified. Threats of firings worsened the leadership vacuum as key figures undercut each other and distanced themselves from responsibility.The administration had some positive stories to tell. Trump\'s vaccine development program, Operation Warp Speed, had helped drive the pharmaceutical industry\'s remarkably fast progress in developing several promising approaches. By the end of the year, two highly effective vaccines would be approved for emergency use, providing hope for 2021.The White House rejected any suggestions that the president\'s response had fallen short, saying he had worked to provide adequate testing, protective equipment and hospital capacity and that the vaccine development program had succeeded in record time."President Trump has led the largest mobilization of the public and private sectors since WWII to defeat COVID-19 and save lives," said Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesperson.But Trump\'s unwillingness to put aside his political self-centeredness as Americans died by the thousands each day or to embrace the steps necessary to deal with the crisis remains confounding even to some administration officials. "Making masks a culture war issue was the dumbest thing imaginable," one former senior adviser said.His own bout with COVID-19 in early October left him extremely ill and dependent on care and drugs not available to most Americans, including a still-experimental monoclonal antibody treatment, and he saw firsthand how the disease coursed through the White House and some of his close allies.Yet his instinct was to treat that experience not as a learning moment or an opportunity for empathy, but as a chance to portray himself as a Superman who had vanquished the disease. His own experience to the contrary, he assured a crowd at the White House just a week after his hospitalization, "It\'s going to disappear; it is disappearing."Weeks after his own recovery, he would still complain about the nation\'s preoccupation with the pandemic."All you hear is COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID," Trump said at one campaign stop, uttering the word 11 times.In the end he could not escape it.\'The Base Will Revolt\'By late July, new cases were at record highs, defying Trump\'s predictions through the spring that the virus was under control, and deaths were spiking to alarming levels. Herman Cain, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate, died from the coronavirus. The previous month he had attended a Trump rally without a mask.With the pandemic defining the campaign despite Trump\'s efforts to make it about law and order, Tony Fabrizio, the president\'s main pollster, came to the Oval Office for a meeting in the middle of the summer prepared to make a surprising case: that mask wearing was acceptable even among Trump\'s supporters.Arrayed in front of the Resolute Desk, Trump\'s advisers listened as Fabrizio presented the numbers. According to his research, some of which was reported by The Washington Post, voters believed the pandemic was bad and getting worse, they were more concerned about getting sick than about the virus\'s effects on their personal financial situation, the president\'s approval rating on handling the pandemic had hit new lows and a little more than half the country did not think he was taking the situation seriously.But what set off debate that day was Fabrizio\'s finding that more than 70% of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans.Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a "no-brainer."Kushner had some reason for optimism. Trump had agreed to wear one not long before for a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after finding one he believed he looked good in: dark blue, with a presidential seal.But Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff -- backed up by other aides including Stephen Miller -- said the politics for Trump would be devastating."The base will revolt," Meadows said, adding that he was not sure Trump could legally make it happen in any case.That was all Trump needed to hear. "I\'m not doing a mask mandate," he concluded.Aside from when he was sick, he was rarely seen in a mask again.The president had other opportunities to show leadership rather than put his political fortunes first.After he recovered from his bout with the virus, some of his top aides, including Kushner and Jason Miller, a senior campaign strategist, thought the illness offered an opportunity to demonstrate the kind of compassion and resolve about the pandemic\'s toll that Trump had so far failed to show.When Trump returned from the hospital, his communications aides, with the help of Ivanka Trump, his daughter, urged him to deliver a national address in which he would say: "I had it. It was tough, it kicked my ass, but we\'re going to get through it."He refused, choosing instead to address a boisterous campaign rally for himself from the balcony of the White House overlooking the South Lawn.Trump never came around to the idea that he had a responsibility to be a role model, much less that his leadership role might require him to publicly acknowledge hard truths about the virus -- or even to stop insisting that the issue was not a rampaging pandemic but too much testing.Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, briefed the president this fall on a Japanese study documenting the effectiveness of face masks, telling him: "We have the proof. They work." But the president resisted, criticizing Kushner for pushing them and again blaming too much testing -- an area Kushner had been helping to oversee -- for his problems."I\'m going to lose," Trump told Kushner during debate preparations. "And it\'s going to be your fault, because of the testing."Morgenstern, the White House spokesperson, said that exchange between the president and Kushner "never happened."Azar, who was sometimes one of the few people wearing a mask at White House events, privately bemoaned what he called a political, anti-mask culture set by Trump. At White House Christmas parties, Azar asked maskless guests to back away from him.Divisions and DisagreementsThe decision to run the government\'s response out of the West Wing was made in the early days of the pandemic. The idea was to break down barriers between disparate agencies, assemble public health expertise and encourage quick and coordinated decision-making.It did not work out like that, and by fall the consequences were clear.Trump had always tolerated if not encouraged clashes among subordinates, a tendency that in this case led only to policy paralysis, confusion about who was in charge and a lack of a clear, consistent message about how to reduce the risks from the pandemic.Keeping decision-making power close to him was another Trump trait, but in this case it also elevated the myriad choices facing the administration to the presidential level, bogging the process down in infighting, raising the political stakes and encouraging aides to jockey for favor with Trump.The result at times was a systemwide failure that extended well beyond the president."What we needed was a coordinated response that involved contributions from multiple agencies," said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the Trump administration."Someone needed to pull that all together early," he said. "It wasn\'t the job of the White House, either. This needed to happen closer to the agencies. That didn\'t happen on testing, or on a whole lot of other things."The relationship between Azar and Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, grew increasingly tense; by early November, they were communicating only by text and in meetings.Birx had lost the clout she enjoyed early on in the crisis and spent much of the summer and fall on the road counseling governors and state health officials.Meadows was at odds with almost everyone as he sought to impose the president\'s will on scientists and public health professionals. In conversations with top health officials, Meadows would rail against regulatory "bureaucrats" he thought were more interested in process than outcome.Some of the doctors on the task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, were reluctant to show up in person at the White House, worried that the disdain there for mask wearing and social distancing would leave them at risk of infection.Vice President Mike Pence was nominally in charge of the task force but was so cautious about getting crosswise with Trump as they battled for reelection that, in public at least, he became nearly invisible.The debates inside the White House increasingly revolved around Atlas, who had no formal training in infectious diseases but whose views -- which Trump saw him deliver on Fox News -- appealed to the president\'s belief that the crisis was overblown.His arrival at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. was itself something of a mystery. Some aides said he was discovered by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary. Others said John McEntee, the president\'s personnel chief, had been Googling for a Trump-friendly doctor who would be loyal.Marc Short, Pence\'s chief of staff, opposed hiring Atlas. But once the president and his team brought him in, Short insisted that Atlas have a seat at the task force table, hoping to avoid having him become yet another internal -- and destructive -- critic.Once inside, Atlas used the perch of a West Wing office to shape the response. During a meeting in early fall, Atlas asserted that college students were at no risk from the virus. We should let them go back to school, he said. It\'s not a problem.Birx exploded. What aspect of the fact that you can be asymptomatic and still spread it do you not understand? she demanded. You might not die, but you can give it to somebody who can die from it. She was livid."Your strategy is literally going to cost us lives," she yelled at Atlas. She attacked Atlas\' ideas in daily emails she sent to senior officials. And she was mindful of a pact she had made with Hahn, Fauci and Redfield even before Atlas came on board: They would stick together if one of them was fired for doing what they considered the right thing.Health officials often had a hard time finding an audience in the upper reaches of the West Wing. In a mid-November task force meeting, they issued a dire warning to Meadows about the looming surge in cases set to devastate the country. Meadows demanded data to back up their claim.One outcome of the meeting was a Nov. 19 news conference on the virus\'s dire threat, the first in many weeks. But while Pence, who led the briefing, often urged Americans to "do their part" to slow the spread of the virus, he never directly challenged Trump\'s hesitancy on masks and social distancing. At the briefing, he said that "decision-making at the local level" was key, continuing a long pattern of the administration seeking to push responsibility to the states.Azar had been cut out of key decision-making as early as February, when Pence took over the task force. Azar would complain to his associates that Pence\'s staff and task force members went around him to issue orders to his subordinates.On tenterhooks about his job status, Azar found an opening that offered a kind of redemption, steering his attention through the summer and fall to Operation Warp Speed, the government\'s effort to support rapid development of a vaccine, lavishing praise on Trump and crediting him for nearly every advance.Behind the scenes, Azar portrayed Hahn to the White House as a flailing manager -- a complaint he also voiced about Redfield. In late September, he told the White House he was willing to fire Hahn, according to officials familiar with the offer.For their part, Hahn, Redfield, Birx and other senior health officials saw Azar as crushing the morale of the agencies he oversaw as he sought to escape blame for a worsening crisis and to strengthen his own image publicly and with the White House.Health officials on the task force several times took their complaints about Azar to Pence\'s office, hoping for an intervention.Caitlin B. Oakley, a spokesperson for Azar, said he had "always stood up for balanced, scientific, public health information and insisted that science and data drive the decisions."Once eager to visit the White House, Hahn became disillusioned with what he saw as its efforts to politicize the work of the Food and Drug Administration, and he eventually shied away from task force meetings, fearing his statements there would leak.If there was a bureaucratic winner in this West Wing cage match, it was Atlas.He told Trump that the right way to think about the virus was how much "excess mortality" there was above what would have been expected without a pandemic.Trump seized on the idea, often telling aides that the real number of dead was no more than 10,000 people.As of Thursday, 342,577 Americans had died from the pandemic.Trump vs. Vaccine RegulatorsIn an Oval Office meeting with senior health officials on Sept. 24, the president made explicit what he had long implied: He wanted a vaccine before the election, according to three people who witnessed his demand.Pfizer\'s chief executive had been encouraging the belief that the company could deliver initial results by late October. But Trump\'s aides tried in vain to make clear that they could not completely control the timing.Fauci and Hahn reminded West Wing officials that a company\'s vaccine trial results were a "black box," impossible to see until an independent monitoring board revealed them. A vaccine that did not go through the usual, rigorous government approval process would be a "Pyrrhic victory," Azar told them. It would be a shot no one would take.Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, said the president never asked him to deliver a vaccine on a specific timetable. But he said Trump sometimes complained in meetings that "it was not going to happen before the election and it will be \'Sleepy Joe\'" who would ultimately get credit.In late October, science and regulations worked against Trump\'s waning hopes for pre-Election Day good news. At the FDA, scientists had refined the standards for authorizing a vaccine for emergency use. And at Pfizer, executives realized that the agency was unlikely to authorize its vaccine on the basis of so few COVID-19 cases among its clinical trial volunteers.They decided to wait for more data, a delay of up to a week.When Pfizer announced on Nov. 9 -- two days after Biden clinched his victory -- that its vaccine was a stunning success, Trump was furious. He lashed out at the company, Hahn and the FDA, accusing "deep state regulators" of conspiring with Pfizer to slow approval until after the election.The president\'s frustration with the pace of regulatory action would continue into December, as the FDA went through a time-consuming process of evaluating Pfizer\'s data and then that of a second vaccine maker, Moderna.On Dec. 11, Meadows exploded during a morning call with Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, the agency\'s top vaccine regulator. He accused Hahn of mismanagement and suggested he resign, then slammed down the phone. That night, the FDA authorized the Pfizer vaccine.In the weeks that followed, Pence, Azar, Fauci and other health officials rolled up their sleeves to be vaccinated for the cameras.Trump, who after contracting COVID-19 had declared himself immune, has not announced plans to be vaccinated.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

He added however that Iran, the Middle East’s hardest-hit country, could obtain vaccines "from other reliable places."  He gave no details, but China and Russia are both allies of Iran. Iran launched human trials of its first domestic COVID-19 vaccine candidate late last month, saying it could help the country defeat the pandemic, despite U.S. sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines. Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen since 2018, when outgoing President Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on January 20, has pledged to rejoin the agreement, if Iran also returns to full compliance.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

First, the American coronavirus pandemic is entering its worst stage yet, with cases and deaths skyrocketing across the country. Last Thursday saw over 3,000 deaths — more than 9/11 or Pearl Harbor — and with ICU beds at or near capacity in most of the country, absent serious change it is possible there will be double or even triple that number per day in a matter of weeks. We may yet top the deadliest day in American history, the Galveston hurricane of 1900 that killed an estimated 8,000 people, very soon. President Trump is doing precisely nothing about this.Second, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is under investigation for bribery and abuse of office, filed a baldly seditious lawsuit calling for the Supreme Court to overturn the election results in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and hand their electoral votes to Trump. It was flatly an attempt to overturn the 2020 election, end constitutional government, and install Trump in power. Before the Supreme Court threw the suit out Friday night, 17 other Republican state attorneys general had joined him, along with 126 members of the Republican caucus in the House, while Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has agreed to represent Trump. And this is just one of dozens of attempts that Republicans at all levels of government have concocted to overturn Trump\'s loss.In short, material conditions in this country have not been this bad since 1932 at least, and the political situation has not been this bad since 1860. The logical endgame of the rapidly-accelerating Republican attempt to destroy democracy while the country burns would be civil war — if it weren\'t for the high probability that Democratic leaders would be too cowardly to fight.But it\'s worth thinking about what a party seriously committed to preserving democracy would do when faced with a seditious opposition party — namely, cut them out of power and force them to behave. Democrats could declare all traitors ineligible to serve in national office, convene a Patriot Congress composed solely of people who have not committed insurrection against the American government, and use that power to re-entrench democracy.The reasoning here is very simple. All members of Congress swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, which establishes a republican form of government. The whole point of a republic is that contests for power are conducted through a framework of rules and democratic elections, where all parties agree to respect the result whether they lose or win. Moreover, the premise of this lawsuit was completely preposterous — arguing in effect that states should not be allowed to set their own election rules if that means more Democrats can vote — and provides no evidence whatsoever for false allegations of tens of thousands of instances of voter fraud. Indeed, several of the representatives who support the lawsuit were themselves just elected by the very votes they now say are fraudulent. The proposed remedy — having Republican-dominated legislatures in only the four states that gave Biden his margin of victory select Trump electors — would be straight-up election theft.In other words, this lawsuit, even though it didn\'t succeed, is a flagrant attempt to overturn the constitutional system and impose through authoritarian means the rule of a corrupt criminal whose doltish incompetence has gotten hundreds of thousands of Americans killed. It is a "seditious abuse of the judicial process," as the states of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin jointly wrote in their response to Texas trying to steal their elections.The Constitution, as goofy and jerry-rigged as it is, stipulates that insurrectionists who violate their oath are not allowed to serve in Congress. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, written to exclude Confederate Civil War traitors, says that "No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress … who … having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same[.]" How the Supreme Court ruled, or whether Republicans actually believe their lunatic claims, is irrelevant. It\'s still insurrection even if it doesn\'t work out.Democrats would have every right, both under the Constitution and under the principle of popular sovereignty outlined in the Declaration of Independence, to convene a traitor-free Congress (also including similar acts committed by Republican senators like Lindsey Graham, David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler, and others), and pass such laws as would be necessary to preserve the American republic. That might include a national popular vote to decide the presidency, ironclad voting rights protections, a ban on gerrymandering either national or state district boundaries, full representation for the citizens of D.C. and Puerto Rico, regulations on internet platforms that are inflaming violent political extremism, a clear legal framework for the transfer of power that ends the lame duck period, and so on. States would be forced to agree to these measures before they can replace their traitorous representatives and senators. If the Supreme Court objects, more pro-democracy justices can be added.This wouldn\'t be the first time such a thing has happened, either. Immediately after the Civil War, the Radical Republican Congress refused to seat delegations from the former rebellious states until they were satisfied with the progress of Reconstruction. Southern states were forced to ratify the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments — which guaranteed due process and universal male suffrage — before their congressional delegations would be seated. (As a consequence, those delegations included numerous Black representatives, until Reconstruction was overthrown.)It is virtually impossible to imagine the ancient, timid fossils that run the Democratic Party even considering this kind of thing (though remarkably, Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey has) because it would require courage, vision, and honestly reckoning with the parlous state of the nation. It would not be illegal, but it would be a step beyond narrow legal proceduralism and into the uncharted waters of aggressive political innovation and raw will-to-power. It could conceivably touch off armed unrest in several states.But it\'s not hard to see where the current conservative trajectory is headed. While elected Republicans have tried to overturn the election using increasingly blatant methods, top conservative pundits are mulling the idea of secession, as their treasonous fire-eater forebears did 160 years ago. The lie that Biden stole the election is now official GOP dogma. By the same token, it is not a coincidence that the Republican Party is ignoring the deadly pandemic (if not actively spreading the virus) while they try to overturn the Constitution. They feel they can safely ignore the welfare of the American people, because they are not accountable to them.Unless this escalating conservative extremism halts from the inside somehow — which is not remotely in sight anywhere — this can only end eventually in a violent confrontation, or (much more likely) Democrats will simply give up and let themselves be defeated. Still, this country was founded by people who thought it was worth putting their lives at hazard to throw off tyrannical rule. Perhaps some of that spirit can once again be found.More stories from theweek.com  Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms reportedly went from Biden\'s VP list to being offered a Bahamas ambassadorship  Joe Biden\'s agriculture appointment is a slap in the face to Black voters  FDA authorizes emergency use for Pfizer vaccine', 'num_of_covid': 1}

I’m hearing that, and that’s terrific,” Trump said of the percentage of Americans who have contracted COVID-19.Trump Announced a Major Vaccine Summit but Forgot to Tell Key FiguresHe appeared to be referencing the increased likelihood that a rising infection rate would bring the country closer to so-called herd immunity, which would effectively stop the virus from spreading because there would be no potential carriers to which it could go. In fact, infectious disease experts say an infection rate would have to be above 70 percent for herd immunity to take hold—a number that, if it were to be reached, would result in hundreds of thousands more Americans dying.Those Trump comments came during a brief Q&A session following his speech before government officials, the press, and some pharmacy executives. It was one of the few times that Trump has addressed the press since the election, in which he was defeated by now President-elect Joe Biden by some 7-million-plus votes and a healthy electoral college margin. And he made it clear that he continued to believe that the results were not legitimate, despite all evidence and legal conclusions to the contrary.“Well, we’re gonna have to see who the next administration is,” he said, when asked why he hadn’t invited a member of President-elect Biden’s transition team to the briefing. “Hopefully the next administration will be the Trump administration, a continuation.”Biden’s COVID Task Force Member Sounds the Alarm Over Trump’s Vaccine Distribution PlanThough the event was ostensibly to praise the work that pharmaceutical companies had done in conjunction with the Trump administration, two of the major vaccine developers—Pfizer and Moderna—declined an invitation to Tuesday’s event. Neither company had been asked about attending the event prior to its announcement.Despite the pomp on Tuesday, the roll out of a COVID-19 vaccine remains a work in progress. On Monday, it was reported that, over the summer, the Trump administration declined the opportunity to buy potentially well over 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, which could put distribution in the U.S. back months, since Americans will need two doses. The president said on Tuesday that he would be signing “an Executive Order to ensure that the United States government prioritizes the getting out of the vaccine to American citizens before sending it to other nations.” But he also said he would not be using the Defense Production Act in order to reorganize elements of the private sector around vaccine production and distribution.“I don’t think it will be necessary,” he explained.The U.S., he said elsewhere, was on the precipice of a major breakthrough in the pandemic. With the vaccine close to being sent out, “the numbers should skyrocket downward,” he said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Or a path to social exclusion? Governments and developers around the world are exploring whether "vaccine passports" - to identify those inoculated against the coronavirus - could help to reopen their economies. But those developing the technologies are urging lawmakers to think seriously about overcoming the obstacles to their use. Biometrics company iProov, together with cyber security firm Mvine, received UK government funding to develop a vaccine pass that is now being tested within Britain\'s National Health Service. Andrew Bud is iProov\'s founder and chief executive. "I think there are huge issues. There are issues of discrimination. There are issues of two classes. There are issues of privilege. There are ageist issues because it\'s likely older people such as myself will get the vaccines before younger people, which means that the older people will have access to services and capabilities the young people are excluded from. So I think there are huge social and political issues raised by vaccines, and it is the role, I think, of civil society and governments to discuss and debate." Here in Manchester, northern England, some 420,000 people are employed in the night-time economy. Event organizers say that while socially distanced concerts and events have kept people in work, they aren\'t financially viable in the long run. Sacha Lord is co-founder of the city\'s Parklife music festival. He says swiftly checking someone\'s level of protection would be a game-changer. "You know, a gig isn\'t a gig, or a festival is not a festival, unless you\'re stood shoulder-to-shoulder with your friends, you\'re on the dance floor. You can\'t create the atmosphere. So those socially distanced gigs, they served a purpose, they kept people in jobs. But we have to look to get back to normal." iProov\'s Bud points out that vaccine certificates are being rolled out in some countries, and in the United States, private-sector health passes have been used to admit people to sports events. It\'s the developers\' job to work out the technicalities, he says. Conversations about the political and social issues can\'t wait. "This is going to happen and the question is, how should it be regulated? How should it be regulated, what limits should be placed on it, what are the boundaries of social acceptability? Those are real questions for civil society and for the government."', 'num_of_covid': 1}

One adviser told The Daily Beast that this month, the president asked if the heads of Pfizer, one of the main vaccine manufacturers, were “Democrats.”“It kind of came out of nowhere and I didn’t really know how to respond,” this source recounted.When Pfizer announced its vaccine breakthrough last month, Trump flew into a tantrum after the company said it had not been directly involved in Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s public-private partnership for developing and distributing COVID vaccines. The president, already aggrieved that no vaccine breakthrough had been announced prior to the election, told certain aides and close allies to go on TV and make public statements rebutting Pfizer’s claims and to allege that the breakthrough was an achievement only Trump and his team could have made, two of the sources said.Those moments of aggrievement underscored several dynamics that have come to define the president’s handling of the COVID crisis: a brewing resentment towards some of the main entities helping with the pandemic response and a constant need for personal affirmation.That need came into focus again on Friday, when it was reported that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, that he should consider polishing up his résumé if the Pfizer vaccine wasn’t approved by the end of the day.The warning wasn’t the first that Meadows had issued to Hahn. According to a pharmaceutical industry source, Meadows summoned the FDA chief to the White House early this month to demand answers as to why the vaccine process wasn’t moving along more rapidly. Meadows subsequently denied to The Daily Beast that he had pushed for Hahn’s resignation during that meeting.“Get a new source,” he said at the time.White House Orders FDA Chief to Authorize COVID Vaccine Today or ResignThis go around, Hahn was the one pushing back on reports that he was being pushed out, saying in a statement that the representation of his talk with Meadows was “untrue.”The White House did not provide comment for this story on Friday afternoon.But a lobbyist working on vaccine manufacturing and development said the mere idea that the White House was applying pressure to the head of the FDA on the eve of the vaccine’s introduction was massively problematic, to the degree that it would breed mistrust in the vaccine’s safety.“It's not as bad as firing the FDA head,” the lobbyists said. “But it does nothing but generate negative headlines over vaccine efficacy.”Trump Cheers ‘Terrific’ Rise in COVID Cases During Off-The-Rails Vaccine SummitThat Trump would apply this type of pressure was hardly surprising, the source said. For months, the president has been at odds with Big Pharma over the trade group’s pre-election advertising campaign attacking him for pursuing a policy that would insist Medicare not pay more for prescription drugs than the most-favored-nation price. Trump had attempted to cut a deal with the trade group in which he would have dropped that policy pursuit in exchange for pharmaceutical companies reducing out-of-pocket drug costs and sending cash cards to Medicare beneficiaries. But the deal blew up over fears that the cards would be politicized—indeed, literally being called “Trump Cards.”The friction has grown worse as Trump has grown increasingly angry at the pace at which a COVID vaccine has been developed and approved. This past week, Trump held a summit to celebrate Operation Warp Speed. But the announcement came before the invitations were sent to key stakeholders. And when the day arrived, representatives from Pfizer and Moderna, another company that recently announced positive vaccine results, declined to show.Trump’s ire has been directed at Hahn as well. For weeks, he has quizzed administration officials on why it’s taking the FDA so long to give final vaccine approval and demanding the White House keeps pressure on the commissioner to “do his job,” according to a source with direct knowledge of the president’s demand.The FDA has a rigorous and well-established review process for vaccine development that involves several stages of clinical trials and copious amounts of data review by outside advisers. It has been structured that way precisely to instill confidence that the final affirmation of a vaccine’s effectiveness is not colored by political or monetary considerations. But the process notably does not accommodate a president’s need for speed, praise, or credit. And that, at this juncture, has appeared to cause problems.“Donald Trump must get the credit for the vaccines. It is a miracle,” the president tweeted on Friday morning, referencing something said by a Fox Business host.“If it had not been for Donald Trump's personal leadership, we would not be seeing a Pfizer vaccine—and, hopefully in the next week, a Moderna approved vaccine,” the White House account tweeted in the afternoon.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

According to Maccabi, an Israeli healthcare provider, only 31 out of 163,000 Israelis developed coronavirus once the Pfizer vaccine had fully taken effect. “This is very, very good news,” Anat Ekka Zohar, Maccabi’s lead vaccines analyst, told the Times of Israel. “It is the first study in the world that looks at such a large number of fully vaccinated patients.” A control sample of the same size, with unvaccinated Israelis, found that more than 6,437 people caught the disease during the same timeframe. A similar study by Maccabi released earlier this week also reported a substantially high rate of protection after the second jab. “It’s a very high level of efficiency and we are seeing a very low percentage of coronavirus among the patients who have taken both shots,” Ms Ekka Zohar said, referring to the latest data. Israel, the world’s fastest vaccinator against Covid, has already given the first of two jabs to nearly a third of its population. Patients with underlying health conditions and the over-35s are taking priority, but this week 16 to 18-year-olds have also been included so they can sit important winter exams.

His lawyers argued that because he was president, he had immunity, and the case was put on hold in January 2020.

Zervos and her legal team are hoping that Trump will be compelled to testify under oath about her allegations. Trump is also facing criminal investigations and a second defamation suit, filed by writer E. Jean Carroll. Carroll accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s at a department store in Manhattan, and in 2019, she sued him for defamation after he publicly denied the claims.

Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Republicans senators made a lowball offer on Sunday to cooperate with the Biden administration on a new coronavirus relief package, increasing the likelihood that the White House will seek to bypass Republicans to fund its proposal. A group of 10 Republican senators led by Susan Collins of Maine pitched Joe Biden a sketch of a relief plan with a reported $600bn total price tag – less than a third of the $1.9tn stimulus package the Biden team has laid out over the last days. The yawning gap between the two numbers caused some observers to question whether Republicans were really trying to reach a deal – or instead were laying the groundwork for future accusations that Biden had not seriously pursued his promises to try to work with Republicans. Asked about the new Republican offer on the NBC News program Meet the Press, national economic council director Brian Deese said Biden is “open to ideas” but would not be stalled. “What he’s uncompromising about is the need to move with speed on a comprehensive approach here,” Deese said. “We have a virus crisis; we have an economic crisis. We have to get shots in people’s arms. We have to get the schools reopened so that parents can go back to work. And we need to provide direct relief to families and businesses across the country who are really struggling here.” One signatory of the Republican offer, senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who has announced his upcoming retirement, told CNN that the $1.9tn price tag was too high “at a time of unprecedented deficits and debts”. But moderate Democratic senator Jon Tester of Montana said the twin crises of the pandemic and record unemployment demanded decisive action. “I don’t think $1.9tn, even though it is a boatload of money, is too much money,” Tester told CNN. “I think now is not the time to starve the economy.” The US has just surpassed 26m confirmed Covid cases and 440,000 deaths. Unemployment insurance claims topped 1m last week and 30 million Americans reported suffering from food scarcity. Hoping for a break with the lockstep partisanship of the Donald Trump years, Biden has made working with Republicans a stated priority of his early presidency. But his advisers have also signaled that speed is important and that they will use a parliamentary measure known as budget reconciliation to fund their Covid relief bill if no Republicans come onboard. With a 50-member majority in the US Senate clinched by the vote of vice-president Kamala Harris, Democrats could advance the relief package alone – if they are able to craft a deal that does not lose centrists such as West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. “This is a unique crisis,” Deese told CNN. “It’s a unique health crisis, a unique economic crisis, and it’s one that calls on all of us to work together with the speed that we need to put a comprehensive response in place.” The Biden plan calls for $1,400 payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits, a $15 minimum wage, support for schools to help them reopen safely, and money for vaccine distribution and administration. Republicans pointed out that Congress has already appropriated $4tn for coronavirus relief in the last year and that some of the $900bn allocated last month has not been spent. Portman said the proposal for $1,400 payouts to individuals in the Biden plan should be restricted based on income. Manchin has echoed that proposal, saying that families earning from $250,000-$300,000 should not necessarily qualify. The importance of keeping Manchin onboard was underscored when the senator reacted negatively to a surprise appearance by Harris on a local West Virginia television station calling for support for more Covid relief legislation. The move was received as an awkward effort to pressure Manchin. “I saw it, I couldn’t believe it,” Manchin said in a local news video. “No one called me. We’re going to try to find a bipartisan pathway forward, but we need to work together. That’s not a way of working together.” In a letter to Biden outlining their offer, the more moderate Republicans quoted his call in his inaugural address for bipartisan unity and said “we welcome the opportunity to work with you.” “We believe that this plan could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support,” the letter said. The Republican proposal mirrored some provisions of the Biden plan, such as $160bn in new spending on vaccines, testing, treatment, and personal protective equipment. The Republicans said they would provide more details on Monday. But Democrats did not appear willing to wait for long to hear the Republican pitch. Senator Bernie Sanders, the incoming chairman of the budget committee, told ABC News’ This Week program: “We have got to act and we have got to act now”.', 'num_of_covid': 2}

But the 67-year-old legal secretary from Sunrise, Florida, plans on keeping her daily routine of avoiding virtually all human contact even after she’s fully inoculated. The same goes for her sister and her brother-in-law, both of whom are over 65 and got their first shots together with her at Marlins Park in Miami, Krinick told The Daily Beast.“With these new variants, we are still worried,” she said, adding, “It seems like this is never ending.”She will continue to get her groceries delivered to her home via Instacart, avoid dining out, and put off visiting her daughter in Knoxsville, Tennessee, until a majority of the U.S. population has been immunized, Krinick said.As extra-contagious mutations of the coronavirus gather strength like a hurricane churning off the Atlantic coast, Floridians like Krinick see no sign of respite. While they have yet to issue formal guidance on congregating by vaccinated people, state and national health experts have assured the general public that the vaccines are effective—even, if perhaps less so, against the variants surging nationwide.But in a state with a long history of pandemic recklessness and where mask mandates are nonexistent, vaccinated Floridians don’t want to risk getting infected by going out in public.Here, getting a shot offers little more than a modicum of relief.Deadly COVID Mutations Can’t Stop the Party in FloridaThanks to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ongoing approach of forcing his state to be wide-open for business and pleasure, surges in community spread seem virtually inevitable. Last weekend, despite warnings from state epidemiologists, a host of potential super-spreader events took Tampa by storm, punctuated by legions of Buccaneers fans, a majority of them maskless, celebrating the home town’s victory when the Super Bowl wrapped up.“Everytime I see super-spreader events like that, yes it does scare me,” said Mark Zeitlin, a 70-year-old from Boynton Beach, Florida, who’s gotten both his shots. “It’s not only Tampa. It’s happening everywhere.”Glenn Charnizon, a 66-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, who also got both doses, said he and his wife won’t be dining out, traveling, or going to the grocery store for a “long, long time.”“Just because we got vaccinated doesn’t mean we can’t get COVID,” Charinzon said. “We’re not taking any chances until 70 to 80 percent of the population is vaccinated.”Meanwhile, the Biden White House is reportedly considering new restrictions on domestic travel with huge implications in Florida, which accounts for more than a third of all documented U.S. cases of the B-117 variant, also known as the highly contagious U.K. variant. Researchers are also monitoring for any Florida outbreaks of other variants from Brazil and South Africa that have been found elsewhere in the United States, but not—officially—in the Sunshine State.DeSantis’ response has been to chastise reporters for allegedly downplaying the coronavirus dangers of social-justice protests and celebrations of Biden’s electoral victory over Donald Trump, striking a defiant tone regarding any travel restrictions. At a Thursday press conference, DeSantis said, “We will oppose it 100 percent. It would not be based in science. It would purely be a political attack against the people of Florida.” A spokesperson for the governor’s office did not respond to email requests for comment.Seniors who spoke to The Daily Beast said DeSantis has been deliberately obtuse in what passes here for containing the pandemic. “The governor of this state is out of control,” said Charnizon. Krinick, the legal secretary, added: “DeSantis? Not a fan. I don’t think he’s doing anything.”To be sure, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, recently said getting both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to stay ahead of the new mutant variants. And Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, a Florida International University infectious disease professor, told The Daily Beast that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly effective in preventing people from getting sick—including when it came to the U.K. variant.Still, given the basic limitations of any vaccine, and the proliferation of variant cases in a state that has stood out for pandemic absurdity, Floridians can’t let up any time soon.“It is possible people who have gotten their second dose can still catch the virus,” Trepka said. “They can be asymptomatic and become infectious. But we are very concerned about more variants popping up because we may get one that vaccines don’t work on.”‘No One Is Thinking About COVID’: Get Ready for Super Bowl SuperspreadersDue to the high degree of community spread in Florida, vaccines alone will not end the pandemic, she argued—even if the shots have amounted to DeSantis’ sole strategy of late.“Even if you are one of those who have gotten full doses, you are still around a lot of people who have not been vaccinated,” she said. “We need people wearing masks, doing physical distance, and avoiding large crowds. Many people are following it religiously and many are not.”The fear and anger at the dangers posed even after vaccination are not confined to the senior citizens DeSantis has prioritized above virtually all others. In the labor and delivery department of North Miami’s Northshore Medical Center, health-care workers who have been fully inoculated are still on guard, said one nurse who asked for anonymity because she did not have authorization from the hospital to speak to the media.“Because of the new variants and people not being safe, I am still wearing a mask when I go out and I am still not going to family functions because I know I can’t trust some family members who are out in the streets and not taking proper precautions,” she said.The terrifying reality that Florida is a living petri dish for coronavirus mutations means seniors like Carla Golembe will just keep isolating themselves even though she’s gotten both her shots.“The variants are scary,” the 67-year-old artist from Delray Beach, Florida, told The Daily Beast. “We don’t know much about them. Just when we think we are beginning to understand this virus, now there are more curveballs.”In two weeks, once her body has built up full immunity, the only major outing she has planned is a trip to her dentist, she said.“Maybe on a quiet afternoon, I will go into a grocery store, double-masked,” she said. “I hope my husband, who also got both his shots, and I can get together with other friends who have been fully vaccinated. We want to hang out again, but at a distance and outdoors, of course.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Last month, as the disease spread over the holidays, states like California and New York went under partial shutdowns, with stay-at-home orders, but this week there has been some improvements. Severe COVID-19 infections are starting to decline, although the death toll mounts. Hospitalisations have fallen nearly 18 percent from the beginning of January, a key indicator of the disease\'s slowing pace, spread and severity. Citing the improvements, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lifted economic restrictions in areas where infection rates had been high and soon plans to reopen New York City restaurants. At a press conference on Wednesday, Cuomo said "At this point it\'s safe to say the holiday surge was anticipated, the holiday surge did happen, but the holiday surge is over." In California this week, Governor Gavin Newsom lifted stay-at-home orders in much of the state. The decision reopens hair salons and outdoor dining, although indoor worship services remain banned. The state\'s most densely populated county, Los Angeles, is looking to reopen schools within two or three weeks, according to an LA Times report on Wednesday. Although, it\'s unclear when the final decision will be made as teachers unions and school districts must agree on when and how to re-open. Meanwhile, U.S. leadership is overseeing a choppy rollout of vaccines amid an emerging threat of more infectious COVID-19 variants from Brazil, the U.K. and South Africa.

Pfizer's vaccine has proven one of the most viable of that lot, and the Department of Health and Human Service purchased 100 million doses of the two-shot vaccine back in July. But HHS could have doubled that supply and decided against it, people familiar with the matter tell The New York Times.After HHS' initial purchase of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Pfizer approached American officials again later in the summer to offer up another 100 million doses, per the Times. U.S. officials reportedly turned them down, leaving Pfizer to sell its doses to other countries. Now, it may not be able to offer any additional doses to the U.S. until June, the Times reports. That means the U.S. has only reserved enough of the Pfizer vaccine to vaccinate 50 million Americans. And that will likely be down to just 25 million by the end of the year, as Pfizer said last week it would only be able to deliver half of its promised doses this month.One possible explanation for the rejection is that the White House thought it would have enough doses if every developer had delivered an effective vaccine; Project Warp Speed does have purchase agreements with five other coronavirus vaccine developers. But beyond the 100 million doses it purchased from Moderna, most of those other candidates just aren't viable yet. It's possible that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, of which the U.S. reserved 400 million doses, will pull through, but it has so far proven less effective than Pfizer and Moderna's candidates.More stories from theweek.com  Trump's jaw-dropping vaccine screwup  Arizona's Republican Party asks followers if they're willing to die to 'Stop the Steal'  House passes massive defense bill with veto-proof majority", 'num_of_covid': 1}

Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Rex/Shutterstock Nearly a year after Gavin Newsom became the first American governor to issue a statewide stay-at-home order to combat the coronavirus, the California leader delivered his “state of the state” address from an empty Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. “Let’s allow ourselves to dream of brighter days ahead,” Newsom said on Tuesday. It was a pep talk for the state – and for himself. America’s most populous state is coming out of its most deadly phase of the pandemic, having lost more than 56,000 to Covid-19. Black and Latino communities face the brunt of the crisis. Businesses have struggled to survive lockdown restrictions. Many public schools have been closed since last March. And the state’s initially clumsy vaccine rollout has only recently picked up speed. Capitalizing on the growing frustrations of economically devastated, pandemic-fatigued residents, Newsom’s fiercest critics have mounted a recall campaign and are prepared to submit, by Wednesday, the requisite 1.5m voter signatures to trigger the vote. The campaign’s organizers say they have already found more than enough backers, and they have collected hefty checks from business developers, venture capitalists and Trump loyalists. State officials have yet to verify the petition signatures, but political analysts say that a gubernatorial recall election later this year appears more or less inevitable. “There’s going to be a recall election – simply put,” said Mindy Romero, the founder of the Center for Inclusive Democracy, a nonpartisan research organization. “What’s more complicated,” she said, “are the reasons why.” In California – one of 19 states that allow voters to remove elected officials before their terms expire – calling a recall election is fairly easy. The only requirement is to collect a number of signatures equal to 12% of the voters in the last election for the office. “So to get this on the ballot is not at all an impossible feat,” said Joshua Spivak, a senior fellow at the Hugh L Carey Institute for Government Reform at Wagner College and expert on recalls. “To opponents of the governor, it’s really appealing as something worth trying.” In 2020 alone, 11 recalls of various officials went to a vote, and eight officials were removed from office as a result, Spivak said. Recall petitions have been launched against every California governor in the last 61 years – though they are almost never successful. Gray Davis, the only California governor who has ever been recalled, was in a far more precarious position in 2003, at the heels of an electricity crisis, facing a $38bn budget deficit. He lost the recall to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who entered the race with a higher profile than any of the Republicans set to face off against Newsom this year. Republicans had already tried and failed five times to get Newsom recalled, when their sixth try, led by the retired sheriff’s deputy Orrin Heatlie, began to gain momentum last year. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, a judge gave Heatlie and his supporters more time to collect signatures. As Newsom enacted restrictions last winter in an attempt to quell the deadliest wave of the pandemic, recallers were able to rally an anti-lockdown base and win over other Californians struggling to cope with the pandemic’s protracted, devastating economic toll. It didn’t help Newsom’s case that around the same time, the governor met up with a dozen of his closest friends and lobbyists for a lavish dinner at Napa’s French Laundry restaurant. “Anytime an elected official is serving under a crisis, it is a precarious situation,” said Romero. “Faced with the pandemic, it would be shocking if the governor and elected officials didn’t receive some negative reaction.” Amid the state’s chaotic vaccine rollout, Newsom’s poll numbers plummeted. A third of voters polled by the University of California, Berkeley, Institute of Governmental Studies in late January rated the governor’s overall handling of the pandemic well, while 44% said he was doing badly. But two months have passed since the last round of major polls, and Democratic strategists are hopeful. “I think that as we start to reopen schools, as we start to get people back to work, as we get more people vaccinated, I think voters are going to take note,” said Drexel Heard, a Democratic political strategist based in Los Angeles. “By next month some baseball stadiums might be reopened,” he added – which could take the steam out a recall effort fueled by anti-lockdown fervor. Romero said she was skeptical that legitimate frustrations with the governor over the state’s policies, school and business closures, its disastrous inefficiency in doling out unemployment aid, and its slapdash vaccine rollout would rile up Democrats and moderate Republicans enough to vote him out of office, just one year before his term expires. More than a serious effort to unseat Newsom, the recall effort is probably more of a strategy to rally Republican voters, boost Republican candidates, and raise funds. “The recall can be a rallying cry, in California and across the county,” Romero said. “For the Republican candidates running against the governor, it can raise their national profiles.” In a recall election, voters are asked two questions: first, whether they want to recall Newsom, and then, who should replace him? With Democrats highly unlikely to run a candidate in the election, liberal and moderate voters who are frustrated with Newsom would be left to choose among Republicans they might agree with even less. The top contenders vying to replace Newsom include the former San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer; the conservative activist Mike Cernovich; and John Cox, who lost to Newsom in 2018 by 23 points, the largest margin in a California governor’s race since the 1950s. Recall campaigners said their effort has broad appeal. More than a third of signatories on the recall petition identify as Democrats or independents, or declined to state their party affiliation, said Randy Economy, a conservative broadcaster and ex-Trump campaign staffer with the Newsom recall campaign. “We have an angry electorate right now” and the campaign is leveraging their frustration, he told the Guardian. But in a deep blue state where less than a quarter of registered voters are Republicans, recall proponents’ far-right, anti-immigrant, anti-housing for homeless people, anti-sex education and anti-gun control platform is likely to alienate most voters, political experts said. A Wednesday evening virtual town hall featured a presentation by the conservative-aligned Election Integrity Project California, where speakers listed spurious allegations of voter fraud in line with Donald Trump and his supporters. “In order to gain relevance in California, the Republicans need to renounce Trump, they need to renounce white supremacy,” said Mike Madrid, a former state Republican party political director who co-founded the conservative Lincoln Project. “The hyperpartisan recall shows that instead, they’re happy to continue swirling down the drain.” Newsom has largely avoided public discussion of the recall effort. “The Republican recall is a partisan attempt to install a Trump supporter as governor,” said Dan Newman, a Newsom political strategist. The governor referenced the recall effort only obliquely in his Dodger Stadium address. “I just want you to know, we’re not going to change course, just because of a few naysayers and doomsdayers.” he said.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

The Czech Republic, Guatemala, Honduras and Hungary — which have either opened diplomatic missions in Jerusalem or pledged to do so — are reportedly soon to receive up to 5,000 doses each from Israel\'s excess stock of the Moderna vaccine. Israel’s government regards all of Jerusalem as its capital. However, most countries base their diplomats elsewhere because the claim is not recognised by the United Nations. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of any future Palestinian state. Local media reports also suggested Italy, Chad, and other unspecified African states that recently renewed diplomatic ties with the Middle Eastern country would be given free jabs. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under fire for using Israel\'s vaccine stockpile to reward friendly countries while donating only a few thousand doses to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, which are classed as occupied territories under international law. A statement from Mr Netanyahu’s office on Tuesday offered to send more vaccines for Palestinian health workers, but said other countries would also receive “symbolic” amounts once Israel had finished its own vaccination campaign. "Our supply is beyond what is needed by the citizens of Israel," Mr Netanyahu told reporters. "We have more than enough to help where we can. It is mostly symbolic." In less than two months, around half of Israelis have received at least one dose of the Pfizer-Biontech or Moderna jabs against Covid-19.

But he actually believes the 33 percent figure is "auspicious." Because vaccinated and non-vaccinated people are mingling, there could be "herd effects of immunization." In other words, when inoculated people interact with people who haven\'t had their shot, the latter individual may still be protected because the other person is. On a larger scale, that would drive down the number of infections among non-vaccinated people, thus shrinking the rate gap between the two groups. > Estimated vaccine efficacy is a function of relative risk of infection in the vaccinated...when there is indirect protection via herd effects, we expect efficacy estimates to decrease because the risk among unvaccinated individuals declines.> > — David Fisman (@DFisman) January 17, 2021More data needs to come in, and Fishman thinks "we\'ll know more" this week, but he\'s cautiously optimistic about how things are going.More stories from theweek.com  5 more scathing cartoons about Trump\'s 2nd impeachment  Trump\'s vaccine delay is getting suspicious  New Yorker reporter\'s footage provides \'clearest view yet\' of Capitol rioters inside Senate chamber', 'num_of_covid': 1}

{'_id': '2f50082eb8b19e436ac4d8aeb458af43', 'title': 'Good News About the Coronavirus Vaccine Is Becoming Contagious', 'description': 'Ever since the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine began last spring, upbeat announcements were stalked by ominous polls: No matter how encouraging the news, growing numbers of people said they would refuse to get the shot.The time frame was dangerously accelerated, many people warned. The vaccine was a scam from Big Pharma, others said. A political ploy by the Trump administration, many Democrats charged. The internet pulsed with apocalyptic predictions from longtime vaccine opponents, who decried the new shot as the epitome of every concern they\'d ever put forth.But over the past few weeks, as the vaccine went from a hypothetical to a reality, something happened. Fresh surveys show attitudes shifting and a clear majority of Americans now eager to get vaccinated.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIn polls by Gallup, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Pew Research Center, the portion of people saying they are now likely or certain to take the vaccine has grown from about 50% this summer to more than 60%, and in one poll 73% -- a figure that approaches what some public health experts say would be sufficient for herd immunity.Resistance to the vaccine is certainly not vanishing. Misinformation and dire warnings are gathering force across social media. At a meeting on December 20, members of an advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited strong indications that vaccine denouncements as well as acceptance are growing, so they could not predict whether the public would gobble up limited supplies or take a pass.But the attitude improvement is striking. A similar shift on another heated pandemic issue was reflected in a different Kaiser poll this month. It found that nearly 75% of Americans are now wearing masks when they leave their homes.The change reflects a constellation of recent events: the uncoupling of the vaccine from Election Day; clinical trial results showing about 95% efficacy and relatively modest side effects for the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna; and the alarming surge in new coronavirus infections and deaths."As soon as it is my turn to get the vaccine, I will be there front and center! I am very excited and hopeful," said Joanne Barnes, 68, a retired elementary school teacher from Fairbanks, Alaska, who told The New York Times last summer that she would not get it.What changed her mind? "The Biden administration, returning to listening to science and the fantastic stats associated with the vaccines," she replied.The lure of the vaccines\' modest quantities also can\'t be underestimated as a driver of desire, somewhat like the must-have frenzy generated by a limited-edition Christmas gift, according to public opinion experts.That sentiment can also be seen in the shifting nature of some of the skepticism. Rather than just targeting the vaccine itself, eyebrows are being raised across the political spectrum over who will get it first -- which rich individuals and celebrities, demographic groups or industries?But the grim reality of the pandemic -- with more than 200,000 new cases and some 3,000 deaths daily -- and the wanness of this holiday season are perhaps among the biggest factors."More people have either been affected or infected by COVID," said Rupali Limaye, an expert on vaccine behavior at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "They know someone who had a severe case or died."Limaye concluded: "They are fatigued and want to get back to their normal lives."A barrage of feel-good media coverage, including rapt attention given to leading scientists and politicians when they get jabbed and joyous scrums surrounding local health care workers who become the first to be vaccinated, has amplified the excitement, public opinion experts say.There remain notable discrepancies among demographic groups. The divide between women and men has become pronounced, with women being more hesitant. Black people remain the most skeptical racial group, although their acceptance is inching up: In September, a Pew Research poll said that only 32% of Black people were willing to get the vaccine, while the latest poll shows a rise to 42%. And though people of all political persuasions are warming to the vaccine, more Republicans than Democrats view the shot suspiciously.The association between vaccine attitudes and political affiliation is worrisome to many behavioral experts, who fear that vaccine uptake will become tied to partisan views, impeding the achievement of a broad immunity."We\'ve seen a growth among both Democrats and Republicans about their intent to vaccinate," said Matthew Motta, a political scientist at Oklahoma State University who studies political opinions and vaccine views. "But it\'s twice the size in Democrats," who, he added, had been souring on the vaccine following President Donald Trump\'s avowal that it would arrive by Election Day.A brighter indication, he said, is that two-thirds of the public say they are at least somewhat confident that a coronavirus vaccine will be distributed in a way that is fair, up from 52% in September.The most pronounced pockets of resistance include rural residents and people between the ages of 30 and 49.Timothy Callaghan, a scholar at the Southwest Rural Health Research Center at Texas A&M School of Public Health, said that rural residents tend to be conservative and Republican, characteristics that also show up among the vaccine-hesitant. They also include immigrants and day laborers, many of whom do not have college degrees or even high school diplomas and so may be more wary of vaccine science."They appear less likely to wear masks, less likely to work from home and there is an opposition to evidence-based practices," Callaghan said.The resistance also springs from their hampered access to health care in remote areas. In addition, the need to take off several hours of work from the inflexible demands of farming for travel and recovery from vaccine side effects makes the shots seem even less compelling, he added.About 35% of adults between 30 and 49 overall expressed skepticism about the vaccine, according to the Kaiser poll. Dr. Scott Ratzan, whose vaccine surveys in New York with the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health echo findings similar to the national polls, noted that this group doesn\'t keep up on flu shots either. They are well out of the age range for routine vaccines."There is no normalizing or habit for this age group to get vaccinated," he said.Black people have remained the most resistant to taking a coronavirus vaccine, largely because of the history of abusive research on them by white doctors. But their willingness to consider it is ticking up. In the Kaiser poll, the share of Black respondents who believe the vaccine will be distributed fairly has nearly doubled, to 62% from 32%.Mike Brown, who is Black, manages the Shop Spa, a large barbershop with a Black and Latino clientele in Hyattsville, Maryland. This summer he told The Times that he was happy to sit back and watch others get the vaccine, while he bided his time.That was then."The news that it was 95% effective sold me," Brown said. "The side effects sound like what you get after a bad night of drinking and you hurt the next day. Well, I\'ve had many of those and I can deal with that to get rid of the face masks."Still, he says, many customers remain skeptical. He tells them: "What questions do you have that you\'re leery about? Just do your investigation and follow the science! Because if you\'re just talking about what you won\'t do, you\'re becoming part of the problem."He does see progress. "A couple of people who were more militant about not taking it are more quiet now," he said. "The seeds are being planted."Another group that has been uncertain about taking the vaccine is health care workers, who typically have high rates of acceptance for established vaccines. In recent weeks, some hospital executives have said that many on their staffs were balking. ProPublica reported that a hospital in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas had to offer some allotted doses to other medical workers in the area, because an insufficient number of their own workers came forward. A sheriff\'s deputy and a state senator got in line.But other hospitals say that staff time slots for the vaccine are becoming a hot commodity.For months, Tina Kleinfeldt, a surgical recovery nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, a hospital in the Northwell Health network, had absolutely no intention of getting the vaccine until long after the science and side effects had been established.Last week, she was randomly offered a rare vaccination slot. Still she refused, despite the admonitions of envious colleagues.Then she began thinking of all the COVID-19 patients she had cared for and the new ones she would inevitably encounter. She thought about her husband and three children. She thought: Well, I can always cancel the appointment at the last minute, right?Then she realized that doses were still so scarce that she might not get another opportunity soon. So she said yes. She became the first nurse on her unit to get the shot.Afterward, she felt some muscle soreness at the site of injection. But she also felt elated, excited and relieved."I felt like I did a good thing, for myself, my family, my patients, the world," Kleinfeldt said. "And now I hope everyone will get it. Isn\'t that crazy?"This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

The package also "includes a plan to temporarily raise the child tax credit that could end up permanently changing the way the country deals with child poverty," The Associated Press reports. Most parents will get monthly payments of up to $300 for each child 5 and under and $250 for children 6 to 17. "The child benefit has the makings of a policy revolution," The New York Times reports. "It is essentially a guaranteed income for families with children," aiding "more than 93 percent of children" in the U.S. A recent study found it will reduce child poverty by 45 percent, and more among Black families. Democrats intend to make the one-year benefit permanent. "Opposition has been surprisingly muted," the Times reports. No Republicans will vote for the bill, but Biden is about to sign "the greatest expansion of the welfare state since LBJ," Politico\'s Playbook said Monday. "How did Democrats win this fight over welfare while barely firing a shot?" Briefly, "the twin crises of disease and recession boosted support for government intervention well beyond what has been tolerated for decades," Politico said. "Donald Trump and the GOP\'s own support for the last two bills depolarized the fight over this one," Republicans have been "distracted by internal divisions," and "the conservative media was distracted by juicier fare than tax policy," like Dr. Seuss and antifa. Some conservatives warn the child credit will "bust budgets and weaken incentives to work or marry," the Times notes. "But a child allowance differs from traditional aid in ways that appeal to some on the right. Libertarians like that it frees parents to use the money as they choose," while "proponents of higher birthrates say a child allowance could help arrest a decline in fertility" and "social conservatives note that it benefits stay-at-home parents." Also, unlike the racially tinged welfare fights of the 1980s and \'90s, many of the beneficiaries here are rural white voters. "Republicans can\'t count on running a backlash campaign," Samual Hammond, a child allowance proponent at the center-right Niskanen Center, tells the Times. "They crossed the Rubicon in terms of cash payments. People love the stimulus checks," and "people on the right are curious about the child benefit — not committed, but movable."

But you would hardly know that if you lived here. Spring breakers flock to the beaches. Cars cram the highways. Weekend restaurant reservations have almost become necessary again. Banners on Miami Beach read “Vacation responsibly,” the subtext being, Of course you’re going to vacation. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Much of life seems normal, and not just because of the return of Florida’s winter tourism season, which was cut short last year a few weeks into the pandemic. Florida reopened months before much of the rest of the nation, which only in recent days has begun to emerge from the better part of a year under lockdown. Live music returned this weekend to the bars of New Orleans. Crowds were pouring into restaurants in Atlanta and Kansas City, Missouri. Movie theaters in California were poised to open their doors soon. Texas reopened this past week from one side of the state to the other, with spring breakers reveling on South Padre Island. Playgrounds are packed in Chicago, and the Texas Rangers are preparing to fill their stadium to capacity next month for the debut of, by god, baseball season. None of this feels particularly new in Florida, which slowed during the worst of the pandemic but only briefly closed. To the contrary, much of the state has a boomtown feel, a sense of making up for months of lost time. Realtors cold-knock on doors looking to recruit sellers to the sizzling housing market, in part because New Yorkers and Californians keep moving in. The unemployment rate is 5.1%, compared to 9.3% in California, 8.7% in New York and 6.9% in Texas. That debate about opening schools? It came and went months ago. Children have been in classrooms since the fall. For better or worse, Florida’s experiment in returning to life-as-it-used-to-be offers a glimpse of what many states are likely to face in the weeks ahead as they move into the next phase of the pandemic — the part where it starts to be over. “If you look at South Florida right now, this place is booming,” Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, recently gloated. “Los Angeles isn’t booming. New York City isn’t booming.” To call what is happening in Florida an actual boom is a stretch. Though the state was fully reopened by late September, its tourism-dependent economy remains hobbled. A $2.7 billion budget deficit will need an injection of federal stimulus money. Orange County, where Orlando is, saw the lowest tourist development tax collections for any January since 2002. Yet in a country just coming out of the morose grip of coronavirus lockdowns, Florida feels unmistakably hot. (And not just because of global warming.) “You can live like a human being,” DeSantis said. “You aren’t locked down. People aren’t miserable.” President Joe Biden’s new hope of getting Americans together to celebrate with their families on the Fourth of July? “We’ve been doing that for over a year in Florida,” the governor boasted. To bask in that feeling — even if it is only that — is to ignore the heavy toll the coronavirus exacted in Florida, one that is not yet over. More than 32,000 Floridians have died, an unthinkable cost that the state’s leaders rarely acknowledge. Miami-Dade County has averaged more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the past two weeks, one of the nation’s most serious outbreaks. And Florida is thought to have the highest concentration of B.1.1.7, the more contagious virus variant first identified in the United Kingdom. Yet Florida’s death rate is no worse than the national average, and better than that of some states that imposed more restrictions, despite its large numbers of retirees, young partyers and tourists. Caseloads and hospitalizations across most of the state are down. The tens of thousands of people who died were in some ways the result of an unspoken grand bargain — the price paid for keeping as many people as possible employed, educated and, some Floridians would argue, sane. “There’s no better place to have spent the pandemic than Miami,” said Patricia García, a freelance writer who moved from New York in 2017. Her 5-year-old daughter has been in school since August. She put her 1-year-old son in day care in July. García, a 34-year-old Democrat, said she found herself unexpectedly defending DeSantis’ policies to her friends up north. “People here, they’ve been able to work. The kids have been able to go to school,” she said. “We have this reputation in Florida of being all Florida Man and crazyland. But I’d much rather be in Florida than California, New York or Chicago.” Florida’s approach infuriated many people. When the state did not close beaches, there was national outrage, though the decision seems obvious in retrospect, given how much safer people are outside. Out-of-state relatives of retirees worried about the risks to their loved ones. But DeSantis made it a priority to protect the state’s many older residents, banning visitors in nursing homes until October and swiftly moving people 65 and older (and beginning Monday, 60 and older) to the front of the line for vaccines. Florida also did not allow hospitals to discharge coronavirus patients back into nursing homes, unlike New York, a policy that likely avoided more fatalities. However, long-term care facilities still account for a third of Florida’s virus deaths, and while deaths are at their lowest levels since November, other signposts are more worrying. The number of COVID-19 patients in the critical care unit at Jackson Health, the state’s largest public hospital system, increased during one week this month by 10% before starting to decline, said Dr. Peter G. Paige, chief clinical officer. “Obviously, we have to keep our guard up,” he said. Florida never imposed a statewide mask mandate, and the governor in September banned local governments from enforcing their own local orders. This week, DeSantis wiped out any outstanding fines related to virus restrictions, stating that most of the restrictions “have not been effective.” Florida ranks in the lower third of states when it comes to vaccinations. The rollout has been confusing and uneven: After weeks of trying unsuccessfully to get a shot, Joan Brewer, 82, who lives in Palm Beach County, thought she had snagged an appointment at a nearby Publix grocery store — only to find after registering that the slot was in Gulf Breeze, in the Florida Panhandle. “That’s a 9-1/2 hour drive, without stops!” she said. (She eventually got a dose at a Federal Emergency Management Agency mass vaccination site in Miami.) Try to buy a home and the experience is frustrating for a different reason: an open house will have 30 cars parked outside. Though Florida’s population growth has slowed during the pandemic, documentary stamps, an excise tax on real estate sales, were 15% higher in January than they were a year ago. Filing fees for new corporations were 14% higher. Alex Pis-Dudot, a real estate agent who has recently knocked on doors in the upscale Miami suburb of Coral Gables to inquire if homeowners might want to sell, said he recently contacted another agent about a house that had been listed for less than a week. She told him that 20 couples had made appointments to see it — and that the seller had already gotten an offer from an investor for $20,000 above the asking price. “It’s a circus right now,” Pis-Dudot said. Macchialina, a well-loved Italian restaurant on Miami Beach, closed for a few days this month after a staff member tested positive for the virus. But the restaurant has been able to operate through most of the pandemic thanks to Florida’s early reopening (and an outdoor courtyard). During the worst of the pandemic, Macchialina laid off 25 employees. Business is still down, but “we can’t complain,” said Michael Pirolo, executive chef and owner. His brother had to permanently shutter his Brooklyn restaurant last April thanks to the long lockdown in New York. “We kind of get this bad rap around the world for not following the rules, because we’re open,” Jacqueline Pirolo, his sister and managing partner, said of Florida. “But for the most part, our clientele that comes to dine with us follows all the rules. We’ve been able to open and to do this safely, and that’s kind of the middle ground.” Rolando Aedo, chief operating officer for the Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau, said about half of restaurant workers and 90% of hotel workers were laid off last year, a loss of about 150,000 jobs practically overnight. Now the volume of reservations on the OpenTable app is at about 97% of what it was just before the pandemic hit Florida, he said. Hotel occupancy is down nearly 20%, which is better than what industry watchers expected. Hotels are busily booking rooms on Miami Beach, despite the city’s efforts to dissuade spring breakers from coming. “Unfortunately, we’re getting too many people looking to get loose,” Mayor Dan Gelber said. “Letting loose is precisely what we don’t want.” At sunset recently, couples and small groups strolled down Ocean Drive, flitting in and out of sidewalk restaurants. Nightclubs like Mango’s Tropical Cafe, a South Beach staple, remain closed. Garage parking costs a whopping $20, part of a spring break price hike. A cluster of friends from Indiana walked off the beach last week in towels and swimsuits. “It was cold at home, and we were trying to have a good time,” said Alli Hahn, 22, a college senior. They found round-trip plane tickets for $96 and a cheap Airbnb rental. So far, it has been a subdued getaway. Police officers are enforcing a ban on beach drinking. Curfew is at midnight. But it’s Florida, and it’s spring. “After a full year, I just needed to get away,” said Christine Gordon, 22. A sign nearby reminded them to “wear a mask at all times.” None of them did.

"Unfortunately, Carrots refused to concede and demanded a recount, and we\'re still fighting with Carrots."Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesThe crowd laughed, and Trump smirked a little. Such hammy pageantry in stately settings, aides say, has long been a part of the job he especially enjoys. He gripped his lectern for the punchline, thumbs behind the presidential seal."We\'ve come to a conclusion," Trump said grandly. "Carrots, I\'m sorry to tell you, the result did not change. It\'s too bad for Carrots."Two years later, after an election result that was too bad for Trump, he has been less willing to accept the cold math of whom the people want to see at the White House.In the weeks since Election Day, the president and his allies have set off on a groundless and dangerous effort to overturn the will of an electorate that rejected him, moving to undercut basic tenets of American democracy to cling to an office he did not expect to win four years ago and has not particularly treasured since, by most accounts.On Monday, after the administrator of the General Services Administration formally designated President-elect Joe Biden as the apparent winner of the election, Trump blessed the move on Twitter while still vowing to move ahead with legal challenges.Yet the president\'s desperate gambit until this point has been so all-consuming, his aversion to losing so well known, that little attention has been paid to a knotty question underpinning it all: What, exactly, was he holding onto? Why fight so hard, and put the country through so much, to keep a position he has often not appeared to want?In some ways, Trump had seemed to imagine his Washington life more closely resembling a rolling turkey pardon -- the pomp and splendor, yes, but also a world largely amenable to his boss-man bearing and binary whims: This bird is spared. Those birds are not. He\'d have his people call the turkey people and hammer out the fine print later. But through it all, his word would be final.This instinct has likewise fueled Trump\'s affection for people-pardoning: He has used his pardon and clemency powers with abandon to reward allies and others whose causes are backed by celebrities. He is still considering a wave of such pardons for the final weeks of his tenure.But for Trump, the more consistent reality of the presidency, laced with briefings and congressional obstacles and impeachment and criticism, has never quite measured up.He has generally relished the aspects of the job that allow him to preside over something, fowl-based or otherwise -- forums well-suited to a leader for whom attention can seem less a wish than a psychic need.The trappings and the title have plainly pleased him the most, placing him at the center of major celebrations for the mere fact of being president. He has marveled at the Bastille Day parade in Paris, taken to the "beautiful phones" at the White House and delighted in serving fast food to college football champions. In July, Trump, who has for years pressed the federal government to stage an elaborate fireworks display at Mount Rushmore, finally got his way.He has also amused himself showing off Air Force One and the Lincoln Bedroom. Then there is the study off the Oval Office, which he converted into a small dining room -- the space, he has informed guests with a twinkle, where Monica Lewinsky would visit President Bill Clinton.Jeff Flake, a Republican former senator from Arizona who spoke forcefully against Trump before leaving office, recalled Trump\'s manifest glee at posing for pictures in his workspace."He loves having people go into the Oval Office -- him sitting with a thumbs-up and for them to stand," he said. "He seemed to never tire of that, of showing people the Oval Office and getting that picture."The president\'s furious bid to keep power, Flake suggested, reflected Trump\'s realization that his future celebrity might never match the present. "No matter how much fame he had before, it didn\'t compare," he said. "Once he had it, it\'s tough to give up."Certainly Trump\'s predecessors have appreciated many perks of the post, holding court with favored entertainers or athletes at the White House and growing fond of their privileged temporary address. But this president has taken a more conspicuous shine to such advantages than most.It is little secret that the mechanics of government never much animated Trump. He has been on most sides of most major political issues throughout his adult life, depending on the day. His reelection campaign barely bothered with a detailed vision for a prospective second term, focusing far more often on cultural grievance and race-baiting rally fare.While he has effectively abdicated any leadership role in steering the nation\'s coronavirus response -- generally processing its devastation this year through the lens of how the pandemic would affect him politically -- the president plans to see to it that the turkey pardon proceeds as scheduled Tuesday.It stands to be one of his few public appearances in recent weeks amid runaway virus case numbers and his continued assault on the integrity of the election. Trump has maintained a light public schedule since Nov. 3 and has often seemed downcast at his handful of engagements, including an announcement about the push to develop coronavirus vaccines, which he had promoted aggressively during the campaign.Besides his regular golf outings on the weekends, the man who has historically seemed to need human interaction for sustenance -- the audience for his perpetual show -- is demonstrating little interest in being around others when he cannot point to something he can credibly call a win.But then, the image of Trump merrily addressing turkeys in this context might register as a fitting turn for an executive end-stage that has constantly commingled calamity and absurdity.It is also something of a culmination after three years of turkey pardons that have at times doubled as surprisingly telling snapshots of Trump\'s frame of mind at various points in his presidency, with cutting asides and easy smiles in equal measure."From what I\'ve seen," said Beth Breeding, a spokesperson for the National Turkey Federation, "the president seems to have really enjoyed them."At the event in 2017, as Trump was working to reverse as much of the Obama legacy as he could, he joked that the White House Counsel\'s Office had reminded him that the former president\'s turkey pardons could not be revoked.In 2018, with congressional investigations looming as Democrats prepared to take control of the House, the president said he had warned Peas and Carrots that "House Democrats are likely to issue them both subpoenas" despite his clemency.And in 2019, as an impeachment inquiry and the upcoming election weighed on him, Trump opened with a bit of self-congratulation ("it\'s always nice to begin by saying the stock market is up again"), allowed his mind to wander to the emotional comforts of his victory in 2016 ("very great day") and complained bitterly about Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee.By the end, though, the president was fulfilling the part of the job that always made the most sense to him: master of ceremonies. He placed his hand over a turkey named Butter, used the word "hereby" to infuse the proceedings with requisite gravitas ("I hereby grant you a full and complete pardon") and started clapping on his way back inside."That was great," Trump said, watching the crowd watch him. "Lot of fun."This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}

We know that and we know that from looking at immunity against the common cold for example. So we know that there are waves of infection over time. So our immunity to coronavirus does wane so we were always going to be looking at booster doses over time. But now what we are looking at is the fact that the virus will continue to mutate, it\'s inevitable that that will occur but that we will keep ahead of that mutation by having available vaccines that cope with the changes that the virus throws at us if you like."COG-UK – set up exactly a year ago is now the world\'s biggest depositary of knowledge about the virus\'s genetics.Three main coronavirus variants - which were first identified in Britain, Brazil and South Africa are under particular scrutiny.Peacock said she was most worried about the variant from South Africa."The reason that I\'m concerned about that is that it is more transmissible, but it also has a change in the genome, a mutation, which we refer to as E484K, which is associated with reduced immunity, so our immunity is reduced against that virus. So that is one that does concern me, in particular.”With 120 million cases of COVID-19 around the world, it’s getting hard to keep track of all the alphabet soup of variants.Peacock\'s teams are now thinking in terms of "constellations of mutations".And when it comes to the future she warns there will be more pandemics.', 'num_of_covid': 1}

For more facts and explanation behind the week’s biggest political stories, sign up to the Refresher here – straight to your inbox every Wednesday afternoon for free. What’s the story? It was the race the Kremlin was desperate to win. The global effort to find and develop an effective vaccine for the coronavirus was not just a matter of life and death for the countries that took part: it was a matter of national pride. Yesterday interim trial data showed that the Russian vaccine, known as Sputnik V, is almost 92 per cent effective against symptomatic Covid after two doses, bringing it in line with many of the jabs that have been developed in the West. Phase three trials reported by the Gamaleya National Research Centre, which developed the vaccine in Moscow, show little or no side effects in 20,000 participants. The Russian vaccine works in a similar way to the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab: by placing the genetic material of Covid-19 into a harmless adenovirus, then injecting it into the patient. So-called “viral vector” vaccines are easier to store and cheaper to produce – making them more convenient than “spike protein” jabs, like the Pfizer and Moderna offerings. For the Russian government, the apparent safety of the Sputnik vaccine represents not just a national and public health victory but a relief, since authorities began distributing the vaccine before the results of the trials. More than 1.5 million people, including the Telegraph’s Moscow Correspondent Nataliya Vasilyeva, have already received it. That gamble appears to have paid off. Ian Jones, professor at the University of Reading, and Polly Roy, professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, yesterday pointed out that the jab’s development “has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency”. “But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated,” they said. “Another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19.” Others are more circumspect. Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has been reluctant to address the news about Sputnik V, despite his enthusiastic support for Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca. In a briefing with reporters yesterday, the Prime Minister’s spokesman insisted any comment on vaccines was a matter for scientists, not Downing Street. Asked why Mr Johnson had not yet welcomed the news, the spokesman would not comment further. Mr Johnson’s reluctance to welcome the news was shared by his Cabinet, who made no mention of the vaccine all day. Looking back That could be explained by the fact that the news follows months of anxiety about the UK’s own vaccine rollout, which began with the first NHS jab in December. Russia’s first dose, meanwhile, was injected in August. Vladimir Putin, the President, announced on television that his daughter was one of the first to receive it. The Russians have not been shy about treating the development of the jab as a competition, either. The product’s name is a reference to Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to be launched from Earth. That satellite was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, and marked both a major turning point in the space race and bitter defeat for the United States. For UK politicians, who pride themselves on their “world-beating” international comparisons, Russia’s vaccine success is problematic, while the timing of the announcement could not have been worse. Hours later, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, issued a statement condemning the Russian courts for their imprisonment of Alexei Navalny, an opposition politician who returned to the country following a near-miss poisoning with a toxic nerve agent, thought to have been carried out by Russian intelligence services. Anything else? All that could mean the UK is unlikely to want to cooperate with Russia on the rollout of its jab – but Russian scientists have already suggested a partnership with Britain. Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the group that funded Sputnik V and a close ally of Mr Putin, said combining a shot of his vaccine with one of the AstraZeneca jab could “actually work better because immunity gets stronger”. “This idea, called heterogeneous boosting, is at the core of the Sputnik vaccine because we use two different shots and we believe this is the best way to fight with mutations and this also fosters a partnership between different vaccine manufacturers,” he told the BBC. The proposal presents ministers with an interesting diplomatic question, as well as potential concerns about vaccine efficacy and logistics. Mixing supplies of Sputnik and AstraZeneca would mean unprecedented co-operation between public health bodies between the two countries. Before coronavirus, the last major incident Public Health England dealt with was the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury by Russian GRU agents, which marked a significant cooling of relations. Elsewhere, both countries also want to use vaccines as a diplomatic tool overseas. With supplies running short and almost all manufacturers based in richer countries, inoculations could become a major source of soft power for the states that have funded their development – including both the UK and Russia. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has already announced the UK will use its war chest of more than 400 million vaccines to help poorer countries around the world once Britons have been protected. Russia, meanwhile, has taken tens of millions of orders from Egypt, Nepal, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina for Sputnik. Both will likely use vaccines to strengthen their influence in regions of diplomatic interest, as well as through politically neutral schemes like the WHO’s Covax. The Refresher take The development of any new vaccine is a boon for the global fight against coronavirus because the disease will not be brought under control until it has been tackled everywhere. But the apparent success of the Sputnik V jab presents Russia’s Western rivals with an interesting dilemma: to embrace and support Mr Putin’s vaccine and consider combining it with their own, or to continue to ignore it. Mr Johnson’s current strategy, to continue to talk up Britain’s successes while jealously guarding its supplies for the first-phase rollout, will come to an end when all UK adults have received their doses. What he and others do next about Sputnik V could mark a major shift in Russia’s relationship with the West and in the course of the pandemic.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

In a statement, Assad’s office said he and his British wife took tests after developing symptoms similar to Covid-19 and will self-isolate at their home for two to three weeks. Both are said to be experiencing mild symptoms so far. Asma al-Assad grew up in the UK and was last year hit with US sanctions by the Trump administration which accused her of being “one of Syria’s most notorious war profiteers.” More than a thousand people have died of coronavirus according to the regime's official figures, while there have been some 15,000 cases overall, though the true number is suspected to be much higher. In the Kurdish-held northeast, the Kurdish authorities have announced a total of 8,689 cases and 368 deaths. Meanwhile in rebel-held northwest Syria, opposition officials have reported 21,209 cases, including 632 deaths. Syria, which is approaching the 10th anniversary of its civil war next Monday, says it has begun a vaccination campaign but has offered few details on the process. The regime says it has obtained vaccines from a “friendly country,” but declined to name it. However, Israeli media reports say that Israel has paid Russia - one of Syria’s allies - $1.2m (£860,000) to provide Syria with the Sputnik vaccine. The same reports state that the payment was made as part of a deal to release an Israeli civilian from custody in Syria. Admitting that Israel had supported Syria’s vaccine efforts would cause significant embarrassment to the regime, which regards the Jewish state as its main enemy in the region. The Syrian health ministry warned of a rise in infections earlier this month, urging compliance with coronavirus measures. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak last year, Damascus has struggled to enforce strict restrictions because of an economic crisis compounded by a devaluation of the local currency on the black market.", 'num_of_covid': 1}

According to multiple sources, leaders at the meeting advised print reporters to push back against requests by the White House press team to learn of questions in advance, or simply to not respond to the Biden team’s inquiries.“While it’s a relief to see briefings return, particularly with a commitment to factual information, the press can't really do its job in the briefing room if the White House is picking and choosing the questions they want,” one White House correspondent said. “That's not really a free press at all.”“It pissed off enough reporters for people to flag it for the [WHCA] for them to deal with it,” another knowledgeable source said.Both Sides Sharpen Their Carving Knives for Biden's COVID Relief PlanThe WHCA Zoom call was off the record, and Daily Beast staffers participated in the talk. Those staffers had no input into this story whatsoever. The reporter who wrote this story was not bound by the terms of the call’s agreement. All of the information in this article was independently gathered, and without his colleagues’ knowledge.Since Biden took office two weeks ago, the White House press team has visibly attempted to draw contrasts with the Trump press team, which had a notoriously antagonistic relationship with reporters and eventually scrapped the traditional daily briefing altogether.During her first presser, Psaki promised to restore regular briefings, including those with top administration health officials, adding that she had a “deep respect for the role of a free and independent press,” and that they shared “a common goal, which is sharing accurate information with the American people.”Biden’s press team did not deny that staffers had solicited questions from reporters. But the White House contended that it has tried to foster a better relationship with the press corps than the previous administration, and has tried to reach out to reporters directly in order to avoid appearing to dodge questions during briefings.“Our goal is to make the daily briefing as useful and informative as possible for both reporters and the public,” a White House spokesperson said. “Part of meeting that objective means regularly engaging with the reporters who will be in the briefing room to understand how the White House can be most helpful in getting them the information they need. That two-way conversation is an important part of keeping the American people updated about how government is serving them.”This practice isn’t totally unheard-of in previous administrations, departments, or federal agencies. For instance, former President Donald Trump’s White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was known to have asked certain news outlets about their questions in advance of some major or high-profile Trump press conferences or events, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Communications staffers during the Bush and Obama years would ask reporters for the gist of questions in advance if they wanted to interview Cabinet secretaries.Biden Team Recruiting Outside Firms to Help Boost COVID-19 Vaccine ManufacturingUnder previous administrations, many White House reporters would meet informally in the morning for gaggles with the press secretaries. During these interactions, White House communications staff could get a sense of the topics reporters were interested in that day, and would come prepared for questions during televised briefings later in the afternoon.Eric Schultz, a former deputy press secretary in the Obama White House, said that the new comms team was restoring normalcy to the briefing process. Finding out what reporters are focusing on, he said, was standard procedure in most pre-Trump White Houses in order to reduce the number of questions that go unanswered during televised briefings.“This is textbook communications work. The briefing becomes meaningless if the press secretary has to repeatedly punt questions, instead of coming equipped to discuss what journalists are reporting on,” he said. “In a non-covid environment, this would happen in casual conversations throughout the day in lower and upper press. One of the few upsides to reporters hovering over your desk all day, is that you get a very quick sense of what they’re working on.”Despite concerns some reporters had with the Biden team’s behind-the-scenes queries, Psaki’s tenure thus far has received positive reviews from many media outlets. The Washington Post told readers to get ready for a “reality-grounded” press briefings, which Forbes has already described as “must-see TV.” The New York Times noted that she had extended an “olive branch” to reporters during her first briefing, which Vox described as a “breath of fresh air.”—With additional reporting by Asawin Suebsaeng.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

She Credits Gin-Soaked Raisins.', 'description': 'Ask Lucia DeClerck how she has lived to be 105, and she is quick with an answer. “Prayer. Prayer. Prayer,” she offers. “One step at a time. No junk food.” But surviving the coronavirus, she said, also may have had something to do with another staple: the nine gin-soaked golden raisins she has eaten each morning for most of her life. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “Fill a jar,” she explained. “Nine raisins a day after it sits for nine days.” Her children and grandchildren recall the ritual as just one of DeClerck’s endearing lifelong habits, like drinking aloe juice straight from the container and brushing her teeth with baking soda. (That worked, too: She did not have a cavity until she was 99, relatives said.) “We would just think, ‘Grandma, what are you doing? You’re crazy,’” said her 53-year-old granddaughter, Shawn Laws O’Neil, of Los Angeles. “Now the laugh is on us. She has beaten everything that’s come her way.” It is a long list. Born in 1916 in Hawaii to parents who came from Guatemala and Spain, she lived through the Spanish flu, two world wars and the deaths of three husbands and a son. She moved to Wyoming, California and back to Hawaii before finally arriving in New Jersey, where she lived with her oldest son. After turning 90, she moved to an adult community in Manahawkin, New Jersey, along the Jersey Shore, where she remained active until she injured herself in a fall about four years ago. “She is just the epitome of perseverance,” O’Neil said. “Her mind is so sharp. She will remember things when I was a kid that I don’t even remember.” DeClerck, the oldest resident of her South Jersey nursing home, learned that she had contracted the virus on her 105th birthday, Jan. 25, the day after she had gotten her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to Michael Neiman, the home’s administrator. At first, she said she was scared. She did not like being isolated, and she missed the daily chatter from the parade of caregivers at Mystic Meadows Rehabilitation and Nursing, a 120-bed facility in Little Egg Harbor. She showed few symptoms, Neiman said. And within two weeks she was back in her room, holding her rosary beads and wearing her trademark sunglasses and knit hat. To her two surviving sons, five grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great grandchildren, who call her Grandma Lucia, she has a new moniker, O’Neil said: “The 105-year-old badass who kicked COVID.” On Monday, she got a shout-out from Gov. Phil Murphy, who described a phone call with her during a coronavirus news briefing. “What an uplifting conversation,” the governor said. DeClerck’s family gathered in January 2020 at Mystic Meadows to celebrate her 104th birthday before the onset of the pandemic. When they learned that she had contracted the virus, they braced for the worst. “We were very concerned,” her son, Phillip Laws, 78, said. “But she’s got a tenacity that is unbelievable,” he added. “And she’s got that rosary — all the time.” A devout Catholic, DeClerck led rosary prayers each week at the nursing home and, before the pandemic, was a fixture at weekly Mass. She raised three sons and ran a corner store for decades with her first husband, Henry Laws Jr., in Los Angeles. She married twice more after returning to Hawaii, where she worked as a home health aide and welcomed grandchildren for summerlong visits. DeClerck is one of 62 residents of Mystic Meadows to have contracted the virus; four patients died, including three who were receiving hospice care, Neiman said. “We’re as careful as possible,” he said, “but this finds a way of sneaking in.” In January, residents were being tested twice a week, and a rapid test in the last week of the month showed that DeClerck had contracted the virus. “At first she was a little apprehensive, a little scared, but she said, ‘God will protect me,’” Neiman said. She had also been vaccinated, which most likely contributed to her recovery. The first studies of Britain’s mass inoculation program showed strong evidence Monday that even one dose of vaccine can help slash coronavirus-related hospitalizations. DeClerck is not the oldest person to beat the virus. Europe’s oldest-known resident, Sister André, contracted the virus at 116. She celebrated with a glass of Champagne on her 117th birthday earlier this month at a nursing home in Toulon, a city in southeastern France. Like Sister André, DeClerck may be ready for a toast. But it is likely to involve gin and a handful of golden raisins. Her family is following suit. “Now all of us are rushing out and getting Mason jars and yellow raisins and trying to catch up,” O’Neil said.

Despite the rebuff, inauguration event planners continued to press the issue, raising fears about the spread of the virus within the Capitol campus and among attendees, particularly if protesters at the event did not wear masks, officials said.One individual involved with the planning said senior officials at the Pentagon pushed back against the vaccination idea primarily because they were worried about muddling the department’s prescribed vaccination playbook—that the process would divert doses away from those in the first wave of distribution. Now National Guard spokespeople say they don’t know how many of the guardsmen have been vaccinated. Another official familiar with the matter, however, said some troops did receive their first shot when they showed up for duty at the Capitol. Meanwhile, dozens of National Guard troops working to help protect the inauguration have tested positive for the virus, according to a report by the Military Times.“What we are doing is screening incoming Guard men and women according to CDC guidelines. This was done upon departure from their individual states and upon arrival to the D.C. Armory,” one National Guard spokesperson told The Daily Beast, adding that temperature checks and screening questions are in place and that masks and social distancing are required “where the mission allows.”“It’s ridiculous that we’re asking these troops to come in and protect people, and we’re not making sure they’re protected themselves,” said one U.S. official helping with the inauguration planning. “This shouldn’t have happened.”The decision not to vaccinate the National Guard troops before their arrival at the Capitol underscores the extent to which the federal government, as well as states across the country, has struggled to navigate the intricate COVID-19 vaccine distribution process and scale immunization.Days after the initial doses were shipped by Pfizer in the second week of December, states reported receiving less vaccine doses than anticipated. Officials working with Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to fast-track a vaccine, rebuffed the states’ concerns, saying a slight shift in the allocation schedule had caused a minor delay but that more vaccine doses were on the way. As the weeks rolled by, vaccination rates remained low throughout the U.S., including within the Department of Defense.One official familiar with the Pentagon’s distribution said Walter Reed Medical Center, in particular, lagged in administering the doses it had received in the first several weeks of the vaccine rollout. And experts began to worry about the national vaccination rate, emphasizing that something needed to be done quickly to scale not just distribution but also immunization.In the initial days of the vaccine distribution, state officials—and officials within the Pentagon— closely followed the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control that detailed how officials should go about doling out doses, including who should receive the vaccine first. It wasn’t until earlier this month, after vaccine rates stalled, that the federal government began to discuss redefining the CDC’s guidelines in an effort to push states to distribute the vaccine more freely.In the first week of January, as The Daily Beast previously reported, officials working on the vaccine and its distribution met at Camp David to discuss the importance of scaling vaccination nationwide more quickly. The idea was to tell states to hand out doses that were set to expire on the shelf to anyone who wanted them even if they fell outside the first recommended CDC wave.Then, a week later, on Jan. 12, the federal government, in tandem with the Biden COVID-19 team, told states to open up the vaccines to everyone in America older than age 65, as well as anyone younger who has a pre-existing condition that could make them more vulnerable to the coronavirus. On top of widening access, the government said it would no longer hold back doses for the second shot of the vaccine and that states should instead try to administer all available doses as quickly as possible.But by that time—days after the mob attacked the Capitol and less than a week before the inauguration—officials at the Pentagon determined it was too late to begin vaccinating all of the National Guard troops called up. There were simply too many of them. And even if the department began vaccinating those called up for inauguration, troops would not be protected by Jan. 20. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are administered in two doses weeks apart from one another, and experts say an individual is not protected until seven days after the second dose.The officials familiar with the conversations about vaccinating the National Guard said discussions about how to protect the troops during their time serving for the inauguration continued throughout December and January. The Pentagon finally settled on the decision to begin administering the vaccine to troops in the Capitol complex anyway, even if the doses do not protect them during the inauguration events.“The idea is to speed up vaccination,” one official working with the Pentagon’s vaccination program said. “And we have all these people in one place. It’s a perfect setting to make sure we give all of them their shots, whether that be their first or second.”The Pentagon initially approved 6,000 National Guard troops to deploy to the Capitol to help protect the inauguration. That number quickly swelled to 25,000, with troops deploying from all 50 states and three territories.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Through their explicit endorsements or complicity of silence, much of the GOP leadership now shares responsibility for the quixotic attempt to ignore the nation\'s founding principles and engineer a different verdict from the one voters cast in November.Many regular Republicans supported this effort, too -- a sign that Trump has not just bent the party to his will, but pressed a mainstay of American politics for nearly two centuries into the service of overturning an election outcome and assaulting public faith in the electoral system. The GOP sought to undo the vote by such spurious means that the Supreme Court quickly rejected the argument.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesEven some Republican leaders delivered a withering assessment of the 126 GOP House members and 18 attorneys general who chose to side with Trump over the democratic process, by backing a lawsuit that asked the Supreme Court to throw out some 20 million votes in four key states that cemented the president\'s loss."The act itself by the 126 members of the United States House of Representatives, is an affront to the country," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. "It\'s an offense to the Constitution and it leaves an indelible stain that will be hard for these 126 members to wipe off their political skin for a long time to come."Speaking on CNN on Friday, Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican, said, "What happened with the Supreme Court, that\'s kind of it, where they\'ve kind of exhausted all the legal challenges; we\'ve got to move on." It was time, he said, for Congress to "actually do something for the American people, surrounding the vaccines, surrounding COVID."With direct buy-in from senior officials like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the president\'s effort required the party to promote false theory upon unsubstantiated claim upon outright lie about unproved, widespread fraud -- in an election that Republican and Democratic election officials agreed was notably smooth given the challenges of the pandemic.And it meant that Republican leaders now stand for a new notion: that the final decisions of voters can be challenged without a basis in fact if the results are not to the liking of the losing side, running counter to decades of work by the United States to convince developing nations that peaceful transfers of power are key to any freely elected government\'s credibility."From a global perspective this certainly looks like many of the cases we\'ve seen around the world where an incumbent tries to hold onto power," said Michael Abramowitz, president of Freedom House, a Washington-based group that promotes democracy abroad with support from both parties.Though the decisions by the Supreme Court and other courts meant that in the end, American "institutions have held strong," he added, "there\'s no question that people around the world are now looking to America and it\'s really important for Americans of all parties to stand up for the rule of law and for democracy."Republicans who have resisted Trump\'s campaign agreed, predicting that the party was risking its own destruction."I keep comparing it somewhat to Jonestown," said former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, referring to the cult that ended in a tragic mass suicide. "They\'ve all drunk the Kool Aid. It just hasn\'t killed them yet."Following the court decision, one of the 126 House Republicans who backed the lawsuit, Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, said that the court\'s decision meant the end of Trump\'s efforts and "closed the books on challenges to the 2020 election results."Democrats took heart in the court\'s decision in the case filed by the Republican attorney general of Texas, one of several dozen that judges have soundly rejected on legal or factual bases, even if more lawsuits are certain to come ahead of Biden\'s inauguration on Jan. 20."Our democracy has withstood Donald Trump for four years," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees election law. "It can withstand these baseless lawsuits for four more weeks."But civil rights attorneys saw the potential for long-lasting damage outside of the legal realm where the Republican efforts -- and the lie that Biden\'s win was the result of widespread fraud -- have so definitively failed.Republican state legislators across the country are already contemplating new laws to make voting harder, as they continue to falsely portray the expansion and ease of mail-in voting during the pandemic as nefarious. Many of them view this year\'s expanded voting ranks as bad for their party, despite Republican successes further down the ballot. Their consideration of new voting restrictions amounts to an ongoing attack on the integrity of the voting system, involving still more false and debunked claims."There is an anti-democratic virus that has spread in mainstream Republicanism, among mainstream Republican elected officials," said Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU. "And that loss of faith in the machinery of democracy is a much bigger problem than any individual lawsuit."Indeed, after the Supreme Court\'s ruling, the Texas Republican Party effectively called for secession by red states whose attorneys general joined in the Texas suit."Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the Constitution," a statement from its chairman, Allen West, read. It followed an observation Rush Limbaugh made earlier in the week, when he said, "I actually think that we\'re trending toward secession."The talk of secession came during a week in which election officials across the country, from both political parties, said they had become the subjects of menacing threats of violence, including to family members, for standing by Biden\'s victory.A website of unknown provenance that caught the attention of law enforcement appeared to promote a hit list of mostly Republican officials who had resisted Trump\'s demands to overturn an election he lost, listing their personal information and imposing red cross hairs over their pictures.Trump made it clear that the Supreme Court decision would not slow a post-campaign campaign, the futility of which has dampened neither its ferocity nor its pertinacity. On Twitter, Trump on Saturday called it a "disgraceful miscarriage of justice" and wrote "WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!"Hours before the court made its decision public the Trump campaign released two ads repeating debunked allegations, indicating it would continue to pressure elected Republican officials to somehow reverse Trump\'s political fate. "Demand an honest election and an honest count, contact your legislators today," one ad exhorted. (The campaign claimed that the ads would begin airing on cable television on Saturday morning, but at least one ad tracking firm said they had not seen any reservations made as of Friday night.)There is one inescapable reality that is driving many party leaders to embrace the president\'s position, as antithetical as it is to democracy. "Donald Trump is still the 800-pound gorilla in the Republican room -- he\'s the biggest gravitational force that\'s probably ever existed in the party," said Christopher Ruddy, CEO of the conservative network Newsmax.Trump\'s popular vote tally of 74 million would have been the largest in American history had Biden not outdone him by 7 million votes. And, Ruddy noted, "Republican voters are up in arms, they feel this election was not fairly accounted for."Ruddy\'s network has something to do with that; it has gained on the behemoth of conservative television, Fox News, by heavily promoting Trump\'s voter-fraud allegations. In doing so Newsmax has helped set off a competition with Fox News\' more strident hosts, as well as those of the smaller conservative channel One America News, to give Trump and his voters what they want: A counter to the reality that Trump soon will be leaving office.Whatever their primary sources of information, Republicans overwhelmingly view the election as fatally flawed; a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday found that only 23% of registered Republican voters -- and slightly less than half of all white men who are registered to vote -- said they believed Biden\'s victory was legitimate.Those doubters do not represent a majority of Americans; 60% of registered voters overall said they accepted the results. But they form the core of the Republican base, and the party\'s leaders have proved continually unwilling to go against them -- especially with a critical runoff looming in Georgia that will determine partisan control of the Senate.Even after Trump\'s loss, catering to the wishes of Republican voters has meant aping the president\'s own paranoid style of politics by clinging to supposed examples of fraud even after they have been debunked in court.For instance, last month Graham said during an interview on "Fox & Friends" that a signature verification machine in Clark County, Nevada, which encompasses Las Vegas, was used improperly to accept "every signature whether it was fraudulent or not." In the same interview, he shared an allegation that people in the county were spotted filling out fraudulent ballots on "a Biden/Harris truck."Those allegations were contained in a lawsuit Republicans filed in the state. Last week a judge found that the signature machine in question had, in fact, sent 70% of the signatures it scanned back to election workers for human verification. "The record does not support" allegations that the machine "accepted signatures that should have been rejected," wrote the judge, James Russell. Similarly, he ruled, a witness account about false ballots filled out on a Biden/Harris vehicle was "not credible."On Friday, a spokesman for Graham declined to address those findings and said the senator "continues to have grave concerns about the expanded use of mail in ballots."In a hearing about the 2020 election in Wisconsin led by statehouse Republicans on Friday, witnesses suggested the state faced election interference from the dead dictators Hugo Chavez and Josef Stalin, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Kanye West.Some of the claims were similar to conspiracy theories contained in suits filed by a conservative lawyer, Sidney Powell, whose attempts to overturn the election results have been regularly rejected by judges. One wrote that a case she brought on behalf of Republican plaintiffs seemed to have been "more about the impact of their allegations on people\'s faith in the democratic process" as well as "trust in our government."Tom Rath, a former Republican attorney general of New Hampshire, who endorsed Biden and opposed his party\'s effort at the Supreme Court, lamented what seemed to be political incentives within his party to shake that trust.

At that point, Trump\'s internal poll numbers had reportedly taken a tumble, Swan notes.With that in mind, he reportedly called his first White House chief of staff, a stunned Reince Priebus, and "acted out his script, including walking up to a podium and prematurely declaring victory on election night if it looked like he was ahead." Indeed, in the lead up to Election Day, Trump reportedly kept his focus on the so-called "red mirage," the early vote counts that would show many swing states leaning red because mail-in ballots had yet to be counted. Trump, Swan reports, intended to "weaponize it for his vast base of followers," who would go to bed thinking he had secured a second-term, likely planting the seeds of a stolen election.

The results also show some protection begins even after the first dose. Though the agency's staff noted that more data would be needed to assess the potential of a single shot. The Food and Drug Administration posted its analysis online ahead of a meeting on Thursday in which outside experts plan to discuss the documents and whether Pfizer's shot should be authorized for emergency use.

The sweet old lady told reporters that she was so happy to get the shot, as it meant she might see her family after being on her own for nearly a year.To some, however, the soon-to-be-91-year-old, who wore a penguin-themed charity Christmas t-shirt as she gamely received her vaccine, was the purest manifestation of their very darkest fears. Keenan, some conspiracy theorists alleged, is a crisis actor employed by the government to trick people into taking the vaccine. Others went further, claiming that Keenan is actually dead and an imposter sat in her place. It wasn’t explained what the exact point of that ruse would be.Of course, there is no evidence to support any of the conspiracy theories around Keenan, who is just a seemingly nice, and definitely alive lady who was the right age and lived in the right place to get the first vaccination. But, as Britain was the first Western nation to grant emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine, it’s also the first to contend with rampant anti-vaxx disinformation during an unprecedentedly huge COVID-19 immunization rollout.Here’s How We Handle People Who Refuse to Get COVID VaccinesRight now, anti-vaxx views in Britain aren’t quite as prevalent as in the United States. According to the latest polling figures, just one in five Brits said they were unlikely to take the vaccine if they’re offered it—a number which has shrunk in recent weeks. By comparison, polling released by Pew Research last week showed that around 39 percent of Americans are either unlikely or definitely not going to take a vaccine when it’s offered.But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t underlying fears ready to be exploited by opportunistic conspiracy theorists. The same polling showed that 48 percent of people in Britain are worried that the vaccine won’t be safe, and over half are worried about its possible side-effects. Other research showed, when exposed to specific bits of vaccine disinformation, less than half of Brits say they’ll definitely take the jab.Experts have said that around 70 percent of the population will need to be vaccinated before COVID-19 can be considered to no longer be a threat—a target that could easily be undermined by anti-vaxxers. “I hope that enough people take these vaccines, but I think it is going to be much more of a challenge than is recognized,” Prof. Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, told the Financial Times last week.The University of Cambridge’s Dr. Jon Roozenbeek, who has carried out research into COVID-19 conspiracy theories, told The Daily Beast, “I’d say the anti-vaccination movement is a pretty significant problem in terms of its potential to reduce trust in vaccinations, and by extension vaccination rates, in both [Britain and the United States].”The theories in Britain largely mimic the trusty old classics pushed in the U.S.—microchips, fetal tissue, 5G, and so on—but they are occasionally given a decidedly British twist. For example, instead of Bill Gates installing microchips in grannies for unspecified reasons, one theory accuses Boris Johnson of carrying out the scheme instead.Inside the World’s COVID Anti-Vaxxer EpicenterEarlier this year, a letter claiming to be from the PM went viral on Facebook. It said, “I am personally writing to you in order to alert you to a new government policy, in which we are proposing that all U.K. residents will be required to wear a RFID [radio-frequency identification] microchip from January 1st 2021.” If the absurd nature of the suggestion itself wasn’t the giveaway, the creators didn’t even use Johnson’s real signature.Another theory suggested that, because Johnson’s dad Stanley wrote a book called The Virus in the early '80s, it proves that the pandemic was all part of a decades-long family plan. Perhaps the most absurd false claim that has been spread is one, reportedly pushed by Russia, that says the British-made Oxford vaccine could turn people into chimpanzees.While in the United States, anti-vaxxing is usually associated with freedom-loving, mask-hating, Trumpist conservatives, protests in Britain have had a more leftist anti-authoritarian flavor. In fact, one of the most prominent anti-vaccination protesters is Piers Corbyn, brother of the former leader of the opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn. Piers Corbyn has called COVID-19 a hoax to install a new world order, using the term “plandemic,” and was charged for his role in anti-lockdown protests this month.Britain is also home to the king of the conspiracy theory, David Icke, who has been banned from some social media platforms for pushing ridiculous yet pervasive theories about the virus. But the focus on loud and eccentric oddballs like Icke and Corbyn risks overlooking much more dangerous and legitimate-looking sources of disinformation, which are much more likely to push people who are undecided about the vaccine to the dark side.Over the summer, The Guardian found that engagement with anti-vaxx posts on British Facebook pages had trebled—with one of the largest sources being an alternative medicine business, with two million likes, which has pumped out dozens of viral vaccine-skeptic posts. ITV News reported research Friday showing that there are some 5.4 million U.K. followers of anti-vaccination accounts across social media.300 Maskless Anti-Vaxxers Proudly Hold Bizarro Farm Bash in VirginiaThe theories have also reportedly infected the country’s National Health Service, which has a central role in the vaccine rollout. According to the Times of London, a Facebook group containing hundreds of NHS staff was home to posts saying that the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine was a new virus, similar to smallpox, to be “unleashed” on the world.It’s sources like these that can sway people who are undecided about getting the vaccine towards avoiding it. A paper published in Nature earlier this year warned, “Anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral.” Those experts predict that anti-vaxx voices will drown out pro-vaccination voices online in the coming months and years.However, Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock has insisted that the government is doing everything it can to stop the anti-vaxx movement from threatening the rollout of the COVID-19 immunization program. Last month, the government agreed with tech companies that it would flag misinformation and would expect a “timely response” for removal. Ministers are also said to get a weekly round-up of new COVID conspiracy theories to help coordinate the effort to neutralize them.“The good news is that it’s not growing,” Hancock said of the anti-vaxx movement last week on LBC radio, without explaining what he was basing that statement on. “We monitor this very carefully and actually the number of people who want to have the vaccine is increasing, and that’s good because obviously that’s the right thing to do.”If the government is looking for a vaccine cheerleader to fight back against disinformation, they could do worse than 90-year-old Keenan. After she took her historic shot Tuesday, she said, “My advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it. If I can have it at 90, then you can have it too.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

{'_id': '2a1dc7fa9baa87a9fb71c83d42788dbc', 'title': 'Scientists to CDC: Set Air Standards for Workplaces Now', 'description': 'Nearly a year after scientists showed that the coronavirus can be inhaled in tiny droplets called aerosols that linger indoors in stagnant air, more than a dozen experts are calling on the Biden administration to take immediate action to limit airborne transmission of the virus in high-risk settings like meatpacking plants and prisons. The 13 experts — including several who advised President Joe Biden during the transition — urged the administration to mandate a combination of masks and environmental measures, like better ventilation, to blunt the risks in various workplaces. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines for reopening schools, but quickly passed over improved ventilation as a precaution. It was only in July that the World Health Organization conceded that the virus can linger in the air in crowded indoor spaces, after 239 experts publicly called on the organization to do so. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times In a letter to the administration, scientists detailed evidence supporting airborne transmission of the virus. It has become even more urgent for the administration to take action now, the experts said, because of the slow vaccine rollout, the threat of more contagious variants of the virus already circulating in the United States, and the high rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths, despite a recent drop in cases. “It’s time to stop pussyfooting around the fact that the virus is transmitted mostly through the air,” said Linsey Marr, an expert on aerosols at Virginia Tech. “If we properly acknowledge this, and get the right recommendations and guidance into place, this is our chance to end the pandemic in the next six months,” she added. “If we don’t do this, it could very well drag on.” The letter was delivered Monday to Jeffrey Zients, coordinator of the Biden administration’s COVID-19 response; Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC; and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The letter urged the CDC to recommend the use of high-quality masks, such as N95 respirators, to protect workers at high risk of infection. At present, health care workers mostly rely on surgical masks, which are not as effective against aerosol transmission of the virus. Many workers vulnerable to infection are people of color, who have borne the brunt of the epidemic in the United States, the experts noted. Biden has directed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which sets workplace requirements, to issue emergency temporary standards for COVID-19, including those regarding ventilation and masks, by March 15. But OSHA will only mandate standards that are supported by guidance from the CDC, said David Michaels, an epidemiologist at George Washington University and one of the signatories. “Until the CDC makes some changes, OSHA will have difficulty changing the recommendations it puts up because there’s an understanding the government has to be consistent,” Michaels said. “And CDC has always been seen as the lead agency for infectious disease.” Public health agencies, including the WHO, have been slow to acknowledge the importance of aerosols in spreading the coronavirus. It was only in October that the CDC recognized that the virus can sometimes be airborne, after a puzzling sequence of events in which a description of how the virus spreads appeared on the agency’s website, then vanished, then resurfaced two weeks later. But the agency’s recommendations on workplace accommodations did not reflect this change. Early in the pandemic, the CDC said health care workers did not need N95 respirators, and could even wear bandannas to protect themselves. It also did not recommend face coverings for the rest of the population. The agency has since revised those recommendations. It recently recommended that people wear two masks or improve the fit of their surgical masks to protect from the virus. “But they don’t talk about why you need a better fitting mask,” said Dr. Donald Milton, an aerosol expert at the University of Maryland. “They’re acknowledging the importance of breathing it in and the route of transmission, and yet they don’t say it clearly in their various webpages.” The agency recommends surgical masks for health care workers and says N95 respirators are needed only during medical procedures that generate aerosols, like certain kinds of surgery. But many studies have shown that health care workers who have no direct contact with COVID-19 patients are also at high risk of infection and should be wearing high-quality respirators, said Dr. Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York and an adviser to Biden during the transition. “The CDC has not emphasized the risk of aerosol transmission enough,” Gounder said. “Unfortunately, concerns about supply continue to muddy the discussion.” Many hospitals still expect their staff to reuse N95 masks per the agency’s recommendation to reuse when supplies are low. But since the masks are no longer in short supply, the agency should change its recommendations, Gounder said. “We really do need to stop this reuse and decontamination approach to N95s,” she added. “We’re a year into this, and that’s really not acceptable.” Hospitals, at least, tend to have good ventilation so health care workers are protected in other ways, the experts said. But in meatpacking plants, prisons, buses or grocery stores, where workers are exposed to the virus for long periods of time, the CDC does not recommend high-quality respirators, nor does it endorse upgrades to ventilation. “If you go to other workplaces, this idea that aerosol transmission is important is virtually unknown,” Michaels said. In food processing plants, for example, a refrigerated environment and the lack of fresh air are ideal conditions for the virus to thrive. But the industry has not put in safety measures to minimize the risk, he added. Employers instead hew to the CDC’s recommendations for physical distancing and cleaning surfaces. The recent emergence of more contagious variants makes it urgent for the CDC to address airborne transmission of the virus, said Marr of Virginia Tech. Germany, Austria and France now mandate N95 respirators or other high-quality masks in public transportation and shops. Marr was one of the experts who wrote to the WHO last summer to push for an acknowledgment of airborne transmission. She did not expect to be in a similar position again so many months later, she said: “It feels like Groundhog Day.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2021 The New York Times Company', 'num_of_covid': 2}
